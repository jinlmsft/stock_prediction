Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ellen West - Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today.
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, cloud and desktop search, resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency.
For today's call, I will begin with the results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after which we will take your questions.
Starting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter, our total revenues of $33.7 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $385 million or $305 million after the impact of our hedging program.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.5 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In constant currency terms EMEA grew 19%. APAC revenues were $5.4 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year and up 28% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation which continue to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
Operating expenses were $11.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Once again the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing head count primarily for cloud and ads followed by advertising investments in cloud, Chromebooks for the back-to-school season and the Google Assistant.
G&A expense trends in the third quarter were affected by a number of factors. In particular, the performance fees accrued in connection with recognition of equity security gains which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A primarily to other cost of revenues.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.2 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 94,372, up 5,314 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were in cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating margin of 25%. As discussed in the previous two quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility. Once again, we've provided a table in our earnings press release to highlight the impact on particular line items.
Other income and expense was $1.8 billion which includes $1.4 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 8.8% for the third quarter, reflecting discrete items, notably an adjustment associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Net income was $9.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $13.06.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.3 billion which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13.2 billion with free cash flow of $7.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $106 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $24.1 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year.
In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $4.9 billion, up 13% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic.
Other revenues for Google were $4.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year fueled by cloud and Play. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.6 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 20% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was relatively flat year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites, offset by an increase in the sites' TAC rate. The increase in the sites' TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. This quarter, we experienced a year-on-year decline in the network TAC rate due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.
Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 23% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.5 billion, up 11% versus last year. And the operating margin was 28.2%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities.
Let me now turn to Other Bets. Revenues were $146 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $727 million. Other Bets' accrued CapEx was $55 million. In terms of Other Bet updates for the quarter, with Waymo in the third quarter, we built on our early rider program, both expanding the group of participants and beginning to test pricing models.
At Verily, the team continues to execute on its various partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies, consistent with its mission to move medicine from reactive to proactive. Recently launched efforts include a joint venture with ResMed to focus on sleeping disorders and a research collaboration with Gilead.
Finally, you can see in our results the benefit and quality of our investment teams GV and CapitalG which are also within Other Bets. Within the $1.4 billion of reported gains in equity securities in OI&E, approximately $400 million was realized in Q3. There will be more detail on these investment activities in the 10-Q.
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. In the third quarter, results reflect FX headwinds with U.S. dollar strengthening in contrast to the tailwinds that enhanced reported results in the first half of the year. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum in our advertising businesses as we apply our strength in machine learning to improve the experience for users and advertisers. As we noted, hardware was only a modest contributor in the third quarter as we launched a new Made by Google family of products for the fourth quarter holiday season.
Second, with respect to profitability, within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. We indicated on the fourth quarter 2017 call that the pace of year-on-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues would begin to slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that again clearly in our results this quarter. As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search. Looking ahead, we expect seasonal impacts to our other cost of sales from hardware sales which are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the year as well as from increased content acquisition costs for YouTube, which have also historically been higher in the fourth quarter.
Within OpEx, we continue to prioritize our investments to support long-term growth. In terms of head count, growth was seasonally higher in the third quarter because we brought on new graduates. We are continuing to invest in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in engineering and product management and to support our most sizable growth areas, in particular, cloud.
As I've mentioned previously regarding sales and marketing, expenses are more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year. As you have seen in prior years, these expenses are particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season.
Other Bets remains a portfolio of earlier stage businesses focused on addressing sizable markets. We are moving toward early stages of commercialization, while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment against achievement of key milestones.
And finally, with respect to CapEx, you can see our continued investment as we build the infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see across our businesses. This includes a number of datacenter construction projects in flight as well as ongoing expansion in our compute capacity.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Ruth. We had a great quarter, and it was particularly special because last month, we celebrated Google's 20th birthday and the 10th birthday of Chrome. It's exciting to think that 20 years in, we are still just at the beginning of what's possible. We get billions of questions from users every day and about 15% of those are queries we have never seen before.
Our mission to make the world's information accessible and useful is as relevant today as when we started. I want to begin by highlighting our recently launched family of hardware. It's a great example of how we bring together Google's strengths to help people through their day. Then I'll touch on ways AI is helping us approach our mission. I'll give an update on our video and advertising platforms. And finally, I'll talk about our growing cloud business.
First, hardware. Every year, we have a new opportunity to push the boundaries of computing. Those experiences come to life in our Made by Google hardware, which combines the latest advances in software, hardware and AI. Our third generation is our best yet. It includes the Pixel 3, Google Home Hub, the Pixel Slate tablet and more. We're getting great feedback, and I'm very excited for users to try these devices, especially as the holiday season approaches.
Our new hardware lineup showcases the best of Google, including the Google Assistant, Android and Chrome. With the Pixel 3, we've used AI to create a best-in-class camera. New features like top shot make it so you never miss a shot. If your timing wasn't perfect, the camera will suggest a better frame and give you the option to save it. And Night Sight will help you take really good pictures even in bad light.
Pixel 3 also has a custom security chip called Titan M. It was built to secure Google's own datacenters and now we are bring it to our users. We also released Google Home Hub, our first smart speaker with a screen. It shows your morning commute, lets you control your smartphone and gives you hand-free help in the kitchen, and Pixel Slate, Chrome OS reimagined as a tablet with all the great apps from the Play Store.
Our hardware efforts are picking up real momentum. For example, daily active users of our Google Home devices have grown by over 5x in the last year alone. I'm incredibly proud of our growing hardware team, including the talented employees who came over from HTC and Nest. Our investments are paying off as we bring the best of Google to more users and in more countries around the world.
Even as we build up our hardware business, we continue to advance our mission across our core products and platforms. Last month, we kicked off 20 years of Google search by introducing some of the biggest updates in many years. They include a new AI powered ranking approach that delivers more relevant results, a redesigned Google feed called Discover to help you stay informed on topics that matter to you and a new search experience for Google images.
We also continue to tackle the information problem of connecting people to relevant jobs right from search. This has already helped connect to over 100 million people in 92 countries to job listings that meet their needs and skills. Now U.S. service members can search for jobs for veterans and enter their military occupational code to see relevant civilian jobs.
The Google Assistant continues to gain traction, drawing on our strengths in machine learning and helpful Google services like search, YouTube and Maps. We have expanded the Assistant to 20 languages and 76 countries and it can now understand and speak more than one language at a time. We launched our first set of smart displays with Lenovo and JBL as well as our own Google Home Hub.
Pixel users in the U.S. will be the first to try our new duplex technology which helps you complete real-world tasks over the phone like calling a restaurant to book a table and we introduced a new way to easily book ride services with your Google Assistant. In Maps, we also made several improvements including a commute tab with live traffic and transit information and support for mixed-mode commutes.
Earlier this month, we announced an exciting test called Project Stream. We are working with video game publisher Ubisoft to stream their latest game, Assassin's Creed Odyssey to Chrome browsers on laptops and desktops. Streaming graphically rich content for video games represents a great technical advance and we look forward to seeing what's possible here.
I'm particularly proud of our strengths in AI are creating life-changing contributions in other fields. For example, our recent flood prediction efforts, which use AI to better predict when floods will occur had the potential to help millions of people get out of harm's way. We are starting in India, where 20% of flood-related fatalities occur today, and we're looking to expand to more countries soon.
Earlier this month, our research has showed how they've applied deep learning models to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for metastatic breast cancer. Our research found that pathologists and AI can work together more effectively than either alone.
Moving to our video and advertising platforms, which are creating economic opportunities for partners around the world. First YouTube. One particular area of focus is educational content. Every day people from all over the world turn to YouTube to learn something new from career skills to coding to cooking. Just this week, we announced a $20 million investment to expand our YouTube Learning initiative which will help fund established and emerging educational careers. We're also partnering with organizations like Goodwill and Year Up to create curated playlists that teach career skills directly in our new learning channel.
YouTube's Ask business continues to provide great results for marketers and creators. At Advertising Week, we announced that we'll be expanding our popular TrueView for actions format. This helps users take action directly from video ads. They can now do things like sign up for a newsletter and soon they'll be able to find movie show times, download apps or even book a trip right from the app. For creators, YouTube is continuing to build alternative revenue products like Super Chat, channel memberships and the ability to sell merchandise directly to fans.
YouTube gaming creator, Marquis player (19:55), increased its revenue by 20% using channel memberships. We continue to see positive traction for our newest subscription experiences too. YouTube Premium YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium are continuing to expand to many new countries. The team is also investing in growing and improving the news experience on YouTube. More prominently surfacing credible news sources on the platform is a big priority for us.
Next, our advertising platforms. Advertisers love that we are bringing our machine learning strengths to offerings like responsive search ads and universal App Campaigns to create more effective ads. One new example is Smart Shopping Campaigns which use signals like seasonality and price to optimize where ads are shown. Tens of thousands of advertisers are using this and seeing an average of 20% more sales for the same budget.
Just last week we announced that Nike, Best Buy and Sephora are joining our Shopping Actions program. This allows people to move seamlessly from browsing to buying with a universal card that works across Google search and our system.
In apps, we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile gaming titles across 1.5 billion devices. Unity's developers can monetize their apps with Google ads without any additional development work.
And lastly, our growing cloud business. At Google Cloud Next, we made over 100 announcements including the Titan security key, which features Google designed firmware to help verify that nothing on a customer's key has been tampered with. And we expanded our breakthrough Cloud AutoML portfolio, which now includes vision, natural language and translation.
And all over the world we are seeing great customer adoption of our Cloud Platform. With help of SAP, Metro, one of the largest B2B wholesalers globally, is centralizing their finance system on Google Cloud Platform. They're using BigQuery to generate data-driven insights to help create more personalized marketing campaigns.
In the U.S., we partnered with the National Institutes of Health to provide access to cloud services that help researchers access large datasets to accelerate biomedical advances. We also added new customers like ING and Broadcom, joining existing customers like PayPal, ANZ Bank and Kroger.
Our G Suite business continues to fuel transformation in companies large and small and we crossed two important milestones in the quarter. Google Drive became the eight Google product with 1 billion monthly active users. And Gmail now has more than 1.5 billion monthly active users.
One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer best known for its popular brand UNIQLO, which is migrating its employees globally to G Suite, while also pursuing AI solutions like on-demand forecasting on Google Cloud Platform. Our cloud business is benefiting from our investments in technical infrastructure including a U.S.-Europe cable that will improve speeds for millions of people.
Before I wrap up, I want to quickly call out our continued momentum in Asia as well as the investments that we are making in the U.S. As you can see from our results, revenue growth in APAC remains strong. This is a reflection of our very focused efforts to build great experiences for the billions of people across the region. We have adapted many of our core products like search, Maps and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users coming online.
We're also building products to meet the specific needs of users in the region like Tez, a digital payments app for India, to help people easily pay their electrician or split it in a bill with just a few taps. Just one year since it launched, over 30 million people in businesses across India now use the app every month and they've collectively made more than 1 billion transactions. We have recently rebranded the app to Google Pay as we look to bring many of the app's features to others around the world.
We are also investing closer to home. In Q3, more than 80% of Alphabet's total capital expenditures was within the U.S. Not only do these investments in datacenters, machines and offices allow us to provide great services to users, they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them, supporting thousands of jobs and countless local businesses. This year-to-date we have added over 9,000 new employees in the U.S. and we continue to grow faster outside the Bay Area than in it.
As you can see, there's exciting momentum across many different areas. I'm constantly struck by the number of incredible opportunities ahead of us as a company and how far we have come over the last 20 years. I want to say a big thank you to all of Googlers around the world who help us deliver on that mission every day.
With that, I'll hand it back to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two for Sundar if I can. Referencing the blog post and some of the changes about how you see the future of search, I wanted to know what some of the key investments you think the company needs to make so that search becomes more visual or relevant and what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with your products relevant to that medium to long term.
And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear from advertisers that there is some blurring between brand and direct response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended lines. It sounds like the YouTube announcements coming out of Adweek were about making YouTube more responsive or more direct response. How are you thinking about the blurring of those lines and what it means for product development long term? Thanks so much.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Eric. I'll take the two. The first on search. You're right that search, we are always trying to anticipate what the user experience expectations are and trying to meet them there. And increasingly in mobile, people do want immersive engaging experiences. They want their experiences to be more visual and that's partly what you saw us announce in our 20th birthday event. And we are excited to move in that direction.
And I do think we have a lot of important assets to bring here. YouTube is a big part of what we do. We are investing in image search and we do have products like Google Maps and Photos which all add to the visual experience. And as part of doing that, we are investing in our advertising offerings as well. And so over time, we'll adapt that so they go hand-in-hand. But I think it's an important evolution for us.
In terms of YouTube, I think part of what makes YouTube great is I think we can offer different opportunities for advertisers. We've always felt direct response is something that can work well on YouTube. And our instinct is bearing out. And I look at my personal use cases that are many times now sometimes instead of search, actually find something I want to do in YouTube, maybe thinking about going to a place. And I research it on YouTube. So I think it offers the same opportunity over time. And from our standpoint, we want to make sure that we are evolving the product to bring those opportunities to advertisers. So I'm very excited by it.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, two questions for you. First, earlier this month or it might have been late last month, Sridhar Ramaswamy, your Head of Ads and Commerce left to go to a VC firm. I'm betting that wasn't a surprise to you, but I'm just hoping you could shed a little light on sort of succession planning for that important role and whether or not you expect any sort of broad changes to ad product strategy.
And then second, just amongst those announcements on the anniversary were the evolution of Feed to Discover. And I recognize that's an evolution of a product, but it does look like you're taking advantage of that long unused white space on google.com. And so, just love to hear a little bit more, just sort of a follow-up on Eric's question on the evolution of search, but how you see that surface in particular evolving and particularly the potential for ad monetization over time. Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Good. On the first one, look I mean we, one of the things I'm really proud about Google is we have a deep bench of talent and for example in the ads team almost all of our senior ads leadership has been here for well over a decade. And so for us, we are fortunate to be able to tap into it.
Our ads leadership comes – Prabhakar who has taken over our ads product and engineering efforts, someone I worked with for many, many years, and most recently has led our G Suite business, but has done many roles before, is a deep computer scientist. And I expect to, for him to continue our tradition of technical excellence with the – approach our advertising work. Also want to mentioned Philip and his team, his extraordinary team, who definitely lead many of our initiatives here. And Philip and Prabhakar, with them I think it's in great hands. And I expect a lot of continuity there.
On your question on search and Discover, it's in addition to making search more visual, one of the things we are very, very focused on is not always do users turn to us and actually ask a question. So we feel our job is to be there when users need us, anticipate what they want and sometimes proactively meet them. That's where services like Discover really play a role. Right? And I think we are thinking hard about how we can surface relevant information for our users, stuff they are really looking for, can act on, in a way in which it's delightful for them and is showing up for them when they need it.
So I see that as an important evolution of search as well. And so you're going to see us investing more. Mobile offers us a great opportunity. And if you use it in Pixel 3, that's the latest product in which we bring our vision of how to bring all these products together and we'll give you a good sense of how we plan to do that over time.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Great. Thank you for taking my questions. First for Sundar, you spent some time on hardware. You spent time discussing your suite of hardware devices, the Google Assistant, the Pixel. How are you measuring the returns on those investments in hardware, both in the products and on the marketing side here in a pretty competitive marketplace? What are the milestones for success that we should be looking for on hardware?
And then for Ruth, as we start to look ahead to 2019, as you plan for 2019, how are you thinking about the relationship between revenue growth and dollars of operating income growth for next year, particularly if the macroeconomic environment were to become, let's say, less of a tailwind to the broader ads environment as it was this year and in prior years? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On hardware, we always want to be at the forefront of computing. And so, and a lot of times that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing together the entire experience in an integrated way for our users. And we genuinely see a very differentiated way to do this. We think of our approach of bringing together AI software and hardware is unique and we think we can deliver the best-in-class experience and we are committed to doing it. At the same time, we want to build a great business here as well. So we are investing in the long run because we see it clearly as an important business opportunity for us as well, so both go hand-in-hand.
We closely look at metrics, and the metrics we have been very focused on for the last couple of years. This is our third generation of hardware. It's the first time we actually are doing our products end-to-end, and we've expanded to newer categories. We look at user feedback and reception. We measure NPS scores. And our scores are now reflecting best-in-class in the category. And beyond that, we're looking at how the market adoption is and we are thoughtfully building a business but we are committed to building and investing for the long run.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And in terms of how we're thinking about planning, we're in the middle of it now. And many of the questions sort of been already asked sort of point to the direction that we feel really good about the underlying strength in the ads business as we've talked about on numerous calls. We continue to invest here because we see ongoing opportunities in particular as we leverage machine learning to provide better experience for users and for advertisers. And some of the comments that Sundar made about the opportunities that open up with visual search again continue to point the direction direct response, continue to point to some of the underlying areas in which we're focused.
But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it, and we continue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long term. Sundar has already commented on both hardware and cloud as really important examples, and we think the steps that we're taking, the investments we're making, provide the foundational support for ongoing long-term sustained growth. And so then we marry that with the second part of your question, which is in how do we think about the pace of investment. As we've said repeatedly, we're very focused on investing for the long term. We're trying to make sure that we prioritize crisply across the opportunity set that we have and we make the right types of trade-offs but we do remain focused on long-term investing given the scale of the opportunities that we see.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Got it, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Two questions please. One, Sundar, could you just update us with your thinking on China and the China market and the extent. I know Google is already in that market, but the extent to which you want to expand, re-expand your presence there with search.
And then in terms of Waymo, just a quick question. Commercialization of Waymo, do you know when, do you have a sense of when you'll have pricing established and you'll have a roughly well-defined and acted on go-to-market strategy with Waymo? Is that the end of this year, beginning of next year, whenever? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
And, Mark, on China, we obviously, we deeply care about serving Chinese users. We've been investing for many years and especially from developing Android. But more recently, we have launched mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go and improved our developer tools there. So we are constantly looking for ways by which we can better serve Chinese users. And that's where we are today.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And then in terms of Waymo, in the third quarter, as I think you know, we extended our Early Rider Program to a larger group and we moved into very early days of commercialization. So we do now have people paying for rides and we're also testing pricing models.
I think the main point, we've said this repeatedly is that, we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience. And so what that means is, we're really expanding the program methodically. We're taking an iterative approach as we continue to broaden the geographic footprint.
And then on top of that, as we've talked about on prior calls, we've been developing the B2B opportunity. So in Phoenix, as an example, we've been piloting with several partners who are sponsoring a service on behalf of their employees and customers. And again it's early days. So small revenues, but we're pleased to be testing this out as well, and then on top of that continuing to explore applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal use vehicles and for last mile solutions for cities. So you can see a move in the third quarter. But as we said repeatedly, it's very early days and we are taking a very deliberate iterative approach to broadening it out.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you, Ruth. Thank you, Sundar.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on map monetization and putting some more ads in the map. Can you just talk about sort of early learnings there? I know you talked about local mobile searches growing quite rapidly in the past. But any early learnings from the monetization and the return that advertisers are getting on that front?
And the second one on video games and Project Stream. Could you just talk a little about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet, and what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and scale direct-to-consumer facing cloud gaming product.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Look, on the ad stuff, we've had ad formats in Maps for some time and we are constantly working to make it more useful and relevant. But I wouldn't underestimate the focus we have on local. Just to give you a sense, local mobile searches are growing faster than just mobile searches overall, and have increased by almost 50% in the last year.
So for us, that's an important focus area and Maps plays a big role there. So we recently announced Local campaigns, which is a new campaign type specifically designed to drive foot traffic to local businesses, right. And it's going to roll out in the coming months. And so that is a big focus.
And as you pointed out, we are definitely launching and experimenting with newer ad formats on Maps itself. We have promoted places which appears on the map itself. We have place page ads which appear on Google listings in Maps and search. But we are definitely in the phase of putting those, testing it out, making sure the user experience works and making sure we can deliver value for advertisers. We are being patient here because the opportunity in local search, it's a big opportunity and we are focused there.
On your second question, look, we today serve our users on gaming across Google ads but in many ways, right. Obviously, Google Play does this a lot. It's a big important vertical on YouTube. And so we touch with gaming developers across many areas already. And so we are thoughtfully thinking about what more we can do there.
And Project Stream, having spent my life on computing. I was blown away by seeing our ability to stream a game which needs real-time interactions and to be able to do that from the cloud. And it's one of the most important technological advances I've seen in a while. And so we are going to focus on that and make sure we are making progress there and bring newer experiences for gamers.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar, one for Ruth. Sundar, can you help us better understand how the remedy in Europe will work in terms of licenses and TAC going forward? And what impact do see that having on financials? And then Ruth, can you just talk about where you are in the hardware replacement cycle in your datacenters? Pretty major step up this year just given that large ramp. How are you thinking about the trajectory into 2019? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Doug. On Europe, I mean it's early to say. We'll begin only implementing the remedy in the next few weeks. But in all these cases, we always, we're focused on complying with the commission's directive and we want to make sure that the transition for both our users and our OEM partners is as smooth as possible.
In this case you're dealing with life cycles for mobile phones. So changes is going to take some time to reach users. And it's difficult to predict how the licensing model will be adopted. But our products are very popular with users across platforms. And so it's early to say but we're focused on doing the right thing there.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And then in terms of technical infrastructure and our CapEx as we talked about last quarter, CapEx reflects our view of the growing opportunity set in our core ads and search businesses as well as the longer-term opportunities in newer businesses in particular to support cloud. And then very importantly, as we've talked about machine learning across Alphabet.
And we're particularly excited about the opportunity with machine learning, because it opens up more services and products for users and for advertisers and for enterprise customers. And so given our view about the long-term potential with these opportunities, we're very focused on ensuring that we have the needed compute capacity to support growth. And that's what you're really seeing with the uptick in investment.
To give you a bit of a breakdown, the largest component continues to be machines. But relative to last year, it's important to note that datacenter construction is an increasing percentage of our CapEx investment. And so we're now in various stages of developing more than 20 datacenter sites globally. We're also investing in network infrastructure such as undersea cables so we can deliver speed and quality. So again this really goes to our view of the opportunity set.
That being said, we do remain very focused on optimizing the use of CapEx and also on compute efficiency. We're very mindful of the fact that our decisions here on CapEx don't just result in CapEx spend but also translate into higher depreciation expenses and that goes both to cost of sales and OpEx. So very careful about how we're using it, but I want to make sure that we've built for the requirements that we have.
And as much as you asked about technical infrastructure, just a quick note that our facility spend, namely real estate, was more muted this quarter and it was primarily just the ongoing work on our ground up development. So you're primarily seeing what's going on, on technical infrastructure here.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you both.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Two questions. Ruth, so you guys posted pretty solid growth all around. But if we look at some of the international markets, each geography had a tougher comp and decelerated a little bit on a currency-neutral basis. So, I guess, stepping that high level, the growth rates are solid. But can you give us any color on the overall macro picture here? I think we're getting mixed feedback from different companies across different sectors. So any high-level comments would be helpful on just the ad market given that you're close to 20% of global advertising ex-China.
And then, Sundar, question on I guess Pixel and just the overall advance that you're seeing in smartphone devices. So as you guys roll out more products like Lens and Gboard and some of these other utilities on top of your 1 billion-plus apps like search and YouTube, is there any way to parse out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the U.S. and Western Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and can you keep adding these additional utilities? Is query volume going up on a per user basis? Any color there will be helpful.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
So in terms of your first question, we actually felt pretty good about the strength globally, which as I noted in opening comments, across the board, 20% growth in the U.S. on a $15 billion base. As Sundar noted, what's going on in APAC, 30% year-on-year growth. It's now over a $5 billion revenue business and we've had sustained quarter after quarter growth at this kind of 30%-ish area, feel really good about that.
And by country, it really does reflect broad-based strength. As he said, we're very focused on the region. And I think we're delivering terrific products and experiences in rapidly growing markets. You see the same thing in other Americas, neutralizing for currency movements, 28% year-on-year growth. So we're really proud of what the teams are doing around the globe.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
And on your second question, one of the things we clearly see when we make a hardware product like Pixel, in which all the tools and the utilities we build are conveniently there integrated and the experience is great. We definitely see users engaging more. And so, we see an opportunity. And that's one of the bigger reasons why we do hardware as well, to show that into an experience, both for our ecosystem as well as for us. It helps us give users a much deeper engaged experience as well. And when you look at all our products, we see that. And so, we do see that as an opportunity.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
Michael Brian Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC
Thanks. I have two for Sundar, kind of the same theme. One is on the Pixel 3. The marketing message is clear. The product looks great. But I wonder, when you look at to date the success ramping the product, what's been the gating factor? Has it been the carriers? Has it been the price? And we look at the factors for why it hasn't scaled as much as the product should have a scaled, what are the factors?
And then on Verily, you called out some deals you've had with big pharmaceutical companies this quarter. But again there I wonder, who's your most natural partnership? Is it hospitals, insurance, governments? So we think about the big opportunity, where is the most natural fit to drive Verily going forward?
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On Pixel, look, first of all, part of the big thing is this is our third generation of hardware. Each generation, first of all, we've been scaling up the product in terms of even the number of units we can make and so on. So if you remember the first couple generations were struggling to meet the early demand we saw. This is the first year we have done it end-to-end and we are ramping up from there. And so each year when I look at all the metrics, be it NPS or be it our sales, be it our reviews, etcetera, everything is progressing well.
But there are, you're right, the gating factors to ramp this up, first of all is to be able to build the supply we need. And second is go-to-market, getting ourselves in as many locations in retail as possible, in as many countries as possible with as many carrier certifications as possible. So in each of those dimensions, we are making progress as well.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
In terms of Verily, what we've talked about there is, they have partnered with a whole host of leading pharmaceutical companies focusing on specific diseases, whether it's diabetic retinopathy or across the board for neurological diseases. I announced a couple of new partnerships, the ResMed arrangement as well as Gilead. And that's what they tend to do. They partner with best-in-class to focus on specific areas where working with the pharmaceutical companies they can, and the technology we have, and benefiting from machine learning, we can really move from reactive to proactive care. That's the Verily focus.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. I just wanted to focus on cloud a little bit more. Sundar, you gave some good color in your prepared remarks. But I'm wondering if you could share with us an update maybe on the partner momentum and direct sales momentum you're seeing in the market, how you've seen that change?
And also if you could highlight, if you've noticed if there's been noticeable changes in win rates over the last year as the product continues to mature. And you, also in the beginning of the year and exiting Q4, you would give us some high-level growth commentary about GCP. and I'm just wondering if you have anything else you could share? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Heather. Look, overall I mean it's now we've been doing this seriously at the next level for three years. And we are definitely seeing strong indicators that are the investment in product is clearly beginning to work. Our value proposition does come through in many competitive situations. I've seen many important wins in what seemed like very, very competitive situations.
I also don't, from the way we see it, it doesn't look like a zero-sum game as you know. We're addressing a large market opportunity here. It seems like very early days. And more importantly, the general sense I get is, we're very aligned with where the market is headed in the long run. And this notion of supporting open architecture so that enterprises don't feel locked in and allowing for a multi-cloud environment to develop. That's the direction we are betting on and our indications are that the market is headed in that direction as well. So that gives us a lot of comfort. That gives us a lot of comfort as well.
And on-the-go to market side, we have really ramped up both in terms of our investments, our direct investments, but also our partnership strategy is beginning to work. And when I look at the pipeline ahead that's we are clearly seeing momentum there as well. In this business, obviously the enterprise business plays in a way in which you do have wins, but those accounts turn into larger revenue deals over time. And so it's very clear to us that we are laying the foundation and we are getting the strong early momentum. And that's the big reason why we are investing in a strong way in the area. And over time, we'll obviously share more here as well.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
And could I just ask one follow-up if possible? I was just wondering if you look at Microsoft, they have a on-premise and cloud strategy. If you look at Amazon ,what they're doing with AWS and VMware, they're kind of doing a similar strategy. Do you think there's a requirement for you to also have an on-premise strategy to solve this hybrid world as long as it's hybrid for? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
We are thoughtfully looking at it. I mean we are increasingly working with partners like, for example our partnership from SAP or Pivotal, VMware, these are all on hybrid cloud solutions. And so we are thinking about how to do that better. and our overall approach to cloud hybrid modernization I think is the right long-term direction and so we are doing that. And there are many, many situations we are in where on-prem is a big, big, big requirement for customers, but with our partnership approach, we've been able to address the needs well. So, I don't see that as a gating issue for us.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Ruth, I just wanted to see if you could quantify the FX headwind. I think it was a negative 1% for Q3 and in Q4, do you anticipate it to be similar or a little worse?
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
I will let you forecast the dollar. As you noted, it was 1 point here. We went from a tailwind in the second quarter to a 1 point drag here going forward. But we called out that and we'll have more in the Q, but noted the impact, for example, a pretty big delta between our reported and fixed and other Americas, 19% to 28% growth and that was really what was going on with the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. We saw some movements in other currencies around the globe, but you can see that, which is why we broke out the geography the way we've done it a number of quarters ago to try and give you, help give a better sense of the types of headwinds and I'll let you forecast the dollar.
Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC
Okay, we look forward to that. Real quick just on EMEA, you were flat on your constant currency growth, 19%, 19% the last two quarters despite with GDPR. So, I would believe that would suggest that you're probably not seeing as big a headwind perhaps as maybe some expect. Could you just talk to the European business and what you're seeing there?
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Look, I mean specifically, I think if your question is around GDPR and so on, first of all, I mean we've always been as a company very, very focused on user privacy and security. And so in some ways we were very early on, engaged on GDPR and we worked very hard to make sure our products are ready in in compliance. We've generally always approached our products with a strong privacy lens for our users. So, and I think that helps us work through these changes, because I don't think they are at odds with what we are trying to accomplish. I think GDPR is a very good and comprehensive set of regulations. And so I think it's been good to see a smooth transition on our products and for our users.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
We're continuing to invest significantly in Europe, because we see the opportunity across Europe and are investing in the communities in which we're working.

Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great, thank you. One quick one for Ruth. People are really asking about Amazon. Just wondering if your e-commerce vertical was any difference versus your other verticals in the quarter. Anything to call out there?
And then secondly, Sundar, a lot of interesting things going on with YouTube and Waymo and cloud and other areas. As you look out two or three years, do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positive difference on the bottom line for overall Google? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Look, I mean, I think on the first thing on e-commerce, maybe really in people, we do see a lot of activity in the vertical on our products, and we see strong growth there as well. We see is an important use case and that's why we are investing a lot. And if you look at our recent work with Shopping Actions, that's an example of the kind of work we are doing there.
And when we do those things, we clearly see users respond. Like for example, on Shopping Actions I think we just recently had partnerships with Best Buy and Nike and Sephora, I mentioned it earlier. So we are continuing to invest there and we are also driving strong partnerships with the retail sector, both in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through cloud. And I think that continues to be a big opportunity.
And on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because as a company over the past 20 years, we have developed deep capabilities in technology, in computer science and especially with machine learning and AI. And we see an opportunity to apply that across a set of important areas. There are a lot of opportunities ahead of us. We are pretty disciplined about where we focus on and we're focused on real large opportunities. And when you mention areas like YouTube and Waymo and cloud and hardware, they all fit the category. But we take a very long-term view. And we want to investigate the user experience right. And we're pretty confident that when we do that, the value will follow.

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet’s second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now, I’ll quickly cover the safe harbor.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today.
And now, I’ll turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you, Ellen.
We delivered another quarter with strong operating performance, reflecting our focus on building great experiences for users, advertisers and enterprise customers around the world. In aggregate, we had substantial revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency. Sites revenues continued to exhibit strong year-on-year momentum, benefiting from innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way.
Our network adverting business maintained a healthy growth, led by AdMob and programmatic advertising. The businesses comprising other revenues, namely Cloud, Play and Hardware again had substantial growth.
Our outline for today’s call is I’ll begin with results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. There are two items to note in our earnings press release. First, we provided a table to highlight the impact of the European Commission fines on operating income, net income and EPS results in the second quarters of 2018 and 2017. Second, as discussed last quarter, our results are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility in OI&E. I’ll highlight the impact on particular line items, as I review the quarter. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.
Starting with the summary of Alphabet’s consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $32.7 billion were up 26% year-over-year. We realized the positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $768 million or $665 million after the impact of our hedging program.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.8 billion, up 26% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 19%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and for British pound. APAC revenues were $5.1 billion, up 36% versus last year and up 34% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Korean won. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 34% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the dollar relative to the Brazilian real.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I’ll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.9 billion, up 34% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which continued to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, followed by hardware-related costs.
Operating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine, were $16 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fines, operating expenses were $10.9 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. Once again, the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing headcount, primarily for Cloud, followed by advertising investments in Cloud and the Assistant.
G&A expense trends in the second quarter were affected by a number of factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.4 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 89,058, up 4,008 from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Operating income was $2.8 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fines, operating income was $7.9 billion, up 15% versus last year, for an operating margin of 24%. Other income and expense was $1.4 billion, which includes $1.1 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 24.2% for the second quarter, reflecting a sizable impact from the non-deductibility of the EC fine. Net income was $3.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $4.54. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $8.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $11.75.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.5 billion, which I’ll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $10.1 billion with free cash flow of $4.7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $32.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail. Google Sites revenues were $23.3 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with strong contributions from both YouTube and desktop search.
Network revenues were $4.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic. Other revenues for Google were $4.4 billion, up 37% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Play and Hardware.
We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.4 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 26% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. This quarter, we experienced year-on-year decline in the network TAC rate as a result of the favorable mix shift within our problematic business.
Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. Operating income was $9 billion, up 17% versus last year and the operating margins was 27.6%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.3 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction, and facilities.
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. Other Bets revenues were $145 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $732 million for the second quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $10 million.
We’re pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. Waymo expanded its partnership with Fiat Chrysler with the option to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its self-driving fleet. And lastly Waymo announced that it has driven more than 8 million fully autonomous miles with most of those on city streets.
A couple of weeks ago, X announced that Loon and Wing have graduated to become independent companies under Alphabet. Graduation from X signals that these companies have reached certain technical and business milestones and that their focus is shifting toward commercialization. And just last week, Loon indicated that it is partnering with Telkom Kenya to launch commercial service in regions of Kenya by early 2019.
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. We’re pleased with the ongoing momentum in our advertising businesses. As discussed previously, we continue to identify new opportunities through innovation, including the benefits of applying machine learning to create more useful experiences for users and advertisers.
Looking ahead, our hardware business is seasonal, typically experiencing lower growth in the third quarter in anticipation of the launch of new products for the holiday season. Second, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. As we’ve discussed for the past couple of quarters, we expected the pace of year-on-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue would slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that clearly in our results of this quarter.
As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, albeit at a more moderate pace relative to the year-on-year increases experienced over the past several quarters.
Within OpEx, we continue to take a disciplined approach to setting priorities as we invest for the long-term growth. The majority of our headcount growth continues to be in technical roles and engineering and product management. In terms of business areas, the largest number of headcount additions were in our cloud business with hires for engineering, sales and marketing.
As a reminder, headcount additions tend to be seasonally higher in Q3 because that is when we bring our new graduates. As I mentioned last quarter, regarding sales and marketing, we continue to expect expenses to be more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season.
Another factor to consider in year-on-year comparisons next quarter is the timing of two expense items in Q3 last year. As we called out last year, there was a meaningful benefit in the third quarter of 2017 from the shift in timing of our annual equity refresh and also from the timing of sales and marketing spend which was more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.
For our Other Bets, we remain focused on making progress on a number of commercial opportunities across the business, while continuing to manage investment against achievement of key milestones.
Third, with respect to CapEx. As I discussed with you last quarter, our commitment to growth is evident in the ongoing trend in CapEx investment. We’ve been investing meaningfully in search and ads consistent with the opportunities we see to benefit the user and advertiser experience. And we are investing in the additional compute power required to support growth in the number of YouTube users globally. We’re also investing in new businesses that are growing at a rapid pace and have sizable compute needs, most notably Cloud. The investment pace also reflects the importance of machine learning across all of our products including search and ads. Although machine learning is more compute-intensive, it is increasingly core to businesses across Alphabet, and opens up the possibility of accelerated innovation in products and services. And keeping with our approach across Alphabet to invest thoughtfully for long-term value creation, we remain focused on both performance and cost effectiveness.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks Ruth. It’s been a busy few months at Google, and we showed a lot of what we are working on at events like Google Marketing Live, Brandcast, and of course our annual developer conference, Google I/O. It was exciting to have millions of people join us in person and via live stream.
Tomorrow, I hope you’ll tune in to Google Cloud Next where the great momentum and innovation in our cloud business will be fully on display. The common thread you’ll hear on today’s call is the benefit of machine learning and AI, and how it’s improving our products and generating great results for our users and partners.
I also hope that everyone enjoyed the World Cup as much as I did. I know our French Googlers were very excited. I loved the competition and was extremely proud to see positive feedback about how useful Google Translate was for people who traveled to Russia. The app translates about 143 billion words a day. And during the World Cup, we saw a huge bump in volume.
In the simple moments when you’re in an unfamiliar place or you don’t know the language, Google is there to help with the right information at the right time. This is what we aspire to best at, and it’s why billions of people continue to put their trust in our products.
Today, I’ll start with how AI is enabling us to advance the mission of making information accessible and useful to everyone in new ways. Then, I’ll share updates on our computing, video and advertising platforms which are helping our partners succeed and grow. And finally, I’ll talk about our growing cloud business.
Let’s begin with AI helping our mission. We revamped the Google News app in May to create reviews. It uses machine learning to highlight top stories organized for users, explore topics more deeply with articles from a range of clustered news sources. We believe in the need to deliver high-quality information and news to users, and to support the news industry as we do so.
The Google Assistant is another the great product based on machine learning. By the end of this year, it will be available in more than 30 languages and 80 countries. We have worked with partners to expand the number of smart devices that are now compatible with the Google Assistant like doorbells, dryers, refrigerators and more, and connect with more than 5,000 devices in the home.
At Google I/O, we also highlighted how AI is improving Google Maps, including enhancing the experience with Assistant and AR features. Through our improvements in machine learning, we have seen a 25x increase in our ability to build maps algorithmically, and we have added 110 million algorithmically drawn buildings to Maps, since the beginning of this year. And with over 1 billion users, we’re continuing to see tremendous growth in maps with especially strong growth in countries like Indonesia, India and Nigeria, each of which are growing over 50% year-on-year.
There are many more great AI powered features we rolled out this quarter including the new version of Gmail with Smart Compose, a new features that helps users craft emails faster. And Google Photos now suggests actions to help you brighten, share, rotate or archive a picture.
Next, our computing, video and advertising platforms. These platforms are providing real economic opportunities for developers, creators and publishers in every corner of the vault. Last year, I announced that in the three-year period from 2014 to 2016, we paid out over $15 billion in revenue to our creator, publisher and app developer partners in Europe, Middle East and Africa via AdSense, YouTube and Google Play. Our contribution is accelerating. In 2017 alone, we generated an additional $7 billion for these partners.
First, our computing platforms. 10 years ago, we launched the first Android phone with a simple idea to build a mobile platform that’s free and open to everyone. Today, there are more than 24,000 devices at every price point from more than 1,300 different brands. The Android ecosystem supports thousands of phone makers and mobile network operators who build and sell Android devices. Millions of app developers around the world who have built their businesses of Android and billions of consumers who can now afford and use cutting-edge Android smartphones. This is all supported by a business model that encourages and enables this open ecosystem to thrive.
Continuing this momentum, at I/O, we unveiled a plethora of new features throughout the Android platform, like battery saving features in Android P, new Google Assistant capabilities on Wear OS, the new Android model to help developers optimize for a variety of devices and form factors, as well as tools to help users understand and control how they are spending time on their device. Our investments in our computing platforms, as well as in AI and design are also helping us generate great momentum in our made by Google hardware business across Pixel, Home, Nest, Chromecast and more. We brought Google Home and Mini to Ireland, Australia, Spain and Mexico. Additionally, bringing the Nest and Google teams together is showing early results. The products can more seamlessly work together and our product development and go-to-market are benefiting from the new alignment. There is a lot more to come here in the next few months.
Second, our video platform, YouTube is growing tremendously. We launched our revamped YouTube Music service across 17 countries, and it’s receiving great feedback from users and artists a lot. This quarter, YouTube rebranded its subscription service, YouTube Premium, featuring originals like our hit series Cobra Kai, which got 41 million views to first episode alone. While advertising on YouTube is an incredibly strong and growing source of income for creators, we are also investing in new ways for creators to generate revenue on the platform, including paid channel memberships, merchandise shelves on YouTube channels, and endorsement opportunities, through a company we acquired in 2016, FameBit. In fact, half of the creators that used FameBit in the first three months of 2018, doubled their YouTube revenue. 
And third, our advertising platforms which are firing on all cylinders, as we put the power of machine learning into marketers’ hands.
At Google Marketing Live, we introduced our newly rebranded advertising products, our core product Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform which provides analytics and ad serving for large marketers and agencies, and Google Ad Manager, our monetization engine for publishers.
We also announced a new ad format powered by machine learning, called Responsive Search Ads. It automates the manual process of building text ads and optimizes them in real time to show the best performing ad for each search query. Advertisers also got a first look at local campaigns and smart campaigns. Local campaigns are designed exclusively to drive foot traffic to local businesses and smart campaigns are now the default for new SMB advertisers. Small business owners love the simplicity and the results.
This quarter, we announced shopping and commerce partnerships with leading global retailers like Carrefour, designed to give people the power to shop wherever and however they want. Carrefour is a great example of how we can partner deeply with companies, bringing our shopping and ads and cloud products together for them. They recently chose to migrate from Office to G Suite for their more than 160,000 employees and have selected us as their main cloud provider, based on our ability to support the Company’s digital transformation.
Speaking of our efforts to help businesses succeed in the cloud, our cloud business has great momentum. It’s a natural extension of our long time strength in computing, data centers and machine learning. We have developed these over many years and they power our own services in the cloud and are now helping others. This week’s Google Cloud Next event will have more than 20,000 SMBs, up from over 2,000 at our Cloud Conference in 2016 with over 250 customers speaking.
I won’t spoil any of the surprises, but I do want to call out Google Cloud’s momentum. Success of our vertical strategy and customer centric approach was illustrated by key wins including Domino’s Pizza, SoundCloud and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Target is migrating three areas of its business to Google Cloud platform. Financial institutions are increasingly turning to the cloud to modernize their systems, explore new business models and improve customer experiences.
New customers include Banco Itaú in Brazil. We also have our rapidly growing business for our specialized cloud AI services. AirAsia expanded its relationship with us to use machine learning and data analytics. We are seeing an acceleration in business adoption of Chromebooks, the most secure and cost efficient way for businesses to enable their employees to work in the cloud.
In Q2, unit sales of managed Chromebooks grew by more than 175% year-over-year. And we saw deployments at customers like Veolia. And to support our growing global customer base, we continue to invest in new cables, open new regions in Finland and Los Angeles, and announced the Zurich region. We now have 17 open regions with three more on the way.
Before I close, I want to give a quick shout out to the work that we are doing to build great specialized products for the next wave of people coming online for the first time in countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria, many of whom experience the web only through their mobile phone. This is a big area of focus for us. Through a great partnership with Indian Railways, and RailTel, we have hit our goal of enabling high-speed public Wi-Fi in 400 train stations across India. We’ve also rolled out this Google Station model in Indonesia and Mexico with more to come soon.
And to help spur AI innovation in Africa, we recently announced the new Google AI research center in Ghana with the goal of bringing together top machine learning researchers and engineers to explore AI research and applications in Africa and beyond.
Of course, our commitment to help communities and people benefit from the digital economy, expense beyond the products that they use. Last month, as part of our broader growth Google effort, we expanded the Google IT Support Professional Certificate program to more than 25 community colleges in the U.S. This will give students an opportunity to learn skills needed to jump start their carriers in IT support.
I want to thank Googlers for their hard work which helps us create products that billions of people love and use every day.
With that, I’ll hand it back over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric Sheridan
Thank you very much. Two questions if I can. Sundar, for you, following upon your comments, we’ve seen all of these partnerships announced in the commerce space. I want to understand how those partnerships might evolve over the next couple of years? What Google brings on table for those partners, what it might do for the advertising services business as we thing long-term? And then, we’ve been getting a lot of questions on Waymo, in the quarter. Is there any you can give us of some of the key investment milestones or how we should be thinking about capital allocated to the Waymo business in the coming years? Thanks so much.
Sundar Pichai
Great. On the commerce front, obviously, it’s a natural sector I think for us to drive partnerships. We already have deep advertising relationships with many of these providers, increasingly. Shopping is an area where we are beginning to work together. And finally, I think cloud is another important way by which we can start working together. So, I do think we are seeing a lot of traction there. I gave the Carrefour example. We also announced strategic partnership and significant investment in JD.com, the second largest ecommerce company in China. Today, we are already, for example in Google Express we’re partnering with over 100 merchants including national retailers like Walmart, Costco, Target, Walgreens and PetSmart. So, there is a lot of traction. I think we are building upon these relationships, trying to have more holistic conversations across the breadth of our offerings, and I think I see all being very synergistic.
Ruth Porat
And then, in terms of Waymo. We remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo. You’ve seen us talk about our progress on a number of fronts. I think the main point is, it is still very early. But, in terms of our progress. So, 2018, the focus has been to launch the commercial rider program in Phoenix that we’ve talked about, looking to do that by year-end. We do view that as a first step in building a more fully rolled out rider program in the future. And as we’ve discussed on prior calls, we continue to trial the program in Phoenix with an emphasis on delivering a safe experience that delights users.
We’ve also continued to build out our vehicle relationships. You saw announcements regarding FCA and Jaguar. We’re expanding our testing to more states. We’re also working on additional areas such as logistics and deliveries. We talked this past quarter about licensing the technology for personal use vehicles, and we’re also focused on working with cities to help strengthen public transportation. More specifically, you’re focused on CapEx. As I said, we’re excited about the long-term opportunity but creation of a new market does take time. and then on the CapEx versus OpEx, the way it works is once the commercial program is up and running beyond what’s viewed as more of a development or R&D phase than much of the investments or CapEx versus OpEx. And that’s for car sensors and any other spend.
So, yes, we’re excited. We do think it’s really an important market, but it is still very early.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini
Great. I just had two questions. One, I was wondering if you could talk about what you’ve seen thus far with the rollout of GDPR? Anything you could share with us, and just how that’s played out versus your expectations at this point? And then, Sundar, as you mentioned, with Google Next upon us, and you’re obviously -- you guys are talking very positively about the business. But, are there anymore stats you can share with us, even about the growth rates in G Suite or GCP or combined? And then, when we think about this business scaling over time, is there any reason to think that the pace of gross margin progression would be materially different than say Azure, AWS at similar revenue levels? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Heather. On GDPR, obviously something we’ve been working on for a long time well over 18 months, but the rollout just happened towards the end of second quarter. So, it’s a bit early to us to say anything. But for us, it’s been super important to get it right, and we’ve always been focused on user privacy. But, it’s been a big change for a lot of our partners as well. And so, we are working closely with our partners and regulators and committed to doing it right, but it’s too early to tell.
And on Google Next and Cloud, obviously the conference is tomorrow. So, I will hold for the announcements there. Couple of things, G Suite has definitely I think seen a lot of momentum, definitely have noticed in the -- now I think it can definitely serve the needs of a large enterprise, it’s clear I gave the Carrefour for example. But increasingly, we are seeing big companies take on the migration. So, that’s been four sure a positive development.
And on Cloud, I think we are investing for the long run. We are definitely seeing traction. A lot of our effort, from a product and technology standpoint, we are definitely there and differentiated. It’s been a lot about investing in our go-to-market efforts. And as we do it, both developing our in-house strength but as well as partnering, those things are beginning to pay dividends. And hopefully, you’ll hear more details at tomorrow’s conference.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak
Thanks for taking my question there. I have two. The first one, the Google Assistant and the Hardware and Google Mini. I was curious, if you could just talk about sort of early learnings and differences in consumer behaviors, how they interact with those devices as opposed to mobile search and the phones? And they’re always very focused on the long-term value proposition for users and advertisers. Maybe talk about the focus, and the hardware is long-term for users and advertisers. And Sundar, I appreciate your color on India and Indonesia and emerging markets. Talk about how you’re strategically trying to position yourself for business potentially beyond advertising and payments or other areas in the countries, if you could, please?
Sundar Pichai
So on Google Assistant, obviously, we see Google Assistant as an important evolution. And obviously, it’s early days, but it’s already exciting to see. People definitely are pushing the boundaries of what they can do with these devices, and home control and automation is a good example of the kind of use case that’s very, very different consumer behavior and which is why our assets in Nest et cetera end up battling over time. So, there is a lot more actions, people are trying to get things done, which is definitely areas we are focused on. But, I think it’s important to understand that experience not just in the context Home and Home Mini, but also your core mobile experience, how it evolves on the phone and across the streams, you’ll have in your life. So, we’re taking the end-to-end user experience in mind, and that’s where all the investments we have done over many, many years I think will come into play as the product evolves.
On your question about emerging markets, the user growth there is extraordinary to see. And we’re seeing it across all our products. So, all our major products, products which have over a billion users each, they are all doing well in these markets. And so, that’s where most of the growth is going to from. And so, it’s an important area of focus. And we do see unique opportunities in these markets, which are different from the markets we are here in here in our more mature markets. You highlighted payments as a good example. And you’ve seen us address that exclusively with Google Tez in India. And so, we will look to do more like that. And beyond just getting our products working better, we’re going to opportunistic, we are investing in talent in these countries. And there is a lot of innovation, which is going to happen from these countries, both for their own markets and for the world beyond. And we want to be in a position to do that well.
Operator
And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Doug Anmuth
Two, if I could. First, for Ruth. You talked about the higher cost, as you shift to machine learning driven business and then also your tech upgrade cycle around machine? Can you give us a sense of where you are in making those transitions and absorbing those investments from a cost perspective? And then, Sundar, mobile strength, clearly in the quarter. Can you just help us understand better how machine learning and AI or driving the stronger growth in mobile search and if there is any specific innovations or products you can point to that are driving that outsized growth? Thanks.
Ruth Porat
So, in terms of your first question and kind of machine learning, and I think you’re kind of getting at cycle. You’re really seeing it in two places, and part of that is they called out is with respect to OpEx. We’re hiring and what you’re seeing is the investments we’re making across the board, it’s ads, it’s cloud, it’s hardware, it’s the Assistant, but this is also very much in machine learning and we are really proud of the team that we have and given the opportunity set that they are able to address. And I think you were getting more broadly at CapEx. The way we’re focused on CapEx, as I said last quarter as well, we view this as it lands into our outlook for growth and the required additional compute capacity. And there are number of growth drivers there. And part is really to support growth that we are seeing in our search and ads business that’s really consistent with the momentum that we’ve commented on today and the exciting opportunities that we see to further enhance the user and advertiser experience. It’s also for our newer businesses, as I noted in opening comments. And then very importantly, it reflects the importance of machine learning across our products including search and ads.
We’ve talked about this in the past, machine learning is more compute intensive, but it also opens up more services and products across Alphabet, and that’s what we are investing in to make sure that we’ve got the capacity with best-in-class compute capacity. And so, the build is really machines, data centers and network infrastructure, and just to make sure and put a fine point on it, while we’re ensuring that we’re well positioned to support the growth we see. We do constantly remain focused on efficiency per unit of compute. We’ve talked about that on many prior calls and are investing here for long-term value creation thoughtfully in order to be able to pursue the opportunities that we see ahead of us.
Sundar Pichai
And Doug, on your question on how is machine learning driving the mobile search experience. The key thing is, it’s doing it at a deeper foundational level. We’ve obviously used machine learning across the board, be it our ranking, actually understanding the intent, the context around the query, and getting you the right answer. I think, the experience is -- I mean, the improvements are happening continuously. And so, we are -- I would just say we are getting deeper in terms of what we are able to do.
In terms of specific innovations of products, it’s super important to understand, I gave the Translate example earlier. While it may seem like a specific use case, it’s obviously -- obviously, we can do translate well because of machine learning. But where it helps us is, we want Google to be the source you think of when you run into a problem. And the fact that the data shows that during the World Cup in Russia, our usage spiked up. To me it shows that when people are running into new things, new experiences, when they have questions on their mind, Google is what they are reaching out to. And I think the way we continue to do that well is by increasingly by using machine learning. So, that’s the depth to which we think about this.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Your line is now open.
Anthony DiClemente
Thank you very much. First for Sundar. You talked about Android in your prepared remarks. In your blog post you said that you are concerned that the Android ruling from the EC sends a troubling signal in favor of proprietary systems over open platform. So, I wonder how are you thinking about the possible business impact from this Android ruling, specifically on tying the Play Store from Search and the Chrome browser. And does it in any way change your strategic approach for Android going forward? And then, for Ruth, on the theme of OpEx investment trends, if we isolate just the other revenue businesses, Cloud, Play and Hardware, all growth drivers, but clearly structurally different in terms of the competitive landscape and profitability. You said, most of the headcount additions are in Cloud, but would love to understand more about how you prioritize investment across Cloud, Play and Hardware, those three? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
On Android, I said in my blog post, Android has really worked well, I think globally for users for everyone in the ecosystem. You can clearly see there is robust competition. There is a lot of innovation, lower prices that has made Android possible at every price point. And so, I think overall, it’s created more choice for everyone, not less. We are analyzing the decision, and I think it’s too early to comment or speculate beyond what you’ve already said. But we will -- we will always take a constructive approach. We’ll appeal the Commission’s decision and take the due process available to us. But, we are also looking forward to finding a solution above all that preserves the enormous benefits of Android to users and so on. So, there is small work to be done, and I think it will become clearer as we go along. But I’m confident that we can find a way to make sure Android is available at scale to users, everyone.
Ruth Porat
And in terms of your question, on investment priorities, I think one of the most important points to underscore is that one of the biggest opportunities for investment, continues to be in our ads business where we are continuing to investment meaningfully, given the opportunity set that we see there. Sundar commented on some of them, as did I, looking at opportunities to enhance the user experience, to continue to improve tools for advertisers, and both of which extend the growth there. And that’s for mobile and what we are increasingly seeing, is, as we focus on mobile, the benefits are across platform and help explain the growth we’re seeing in desktop and YouTube. So, we are continuing to invest here. I don’t want to leave with an answer, with the notion that the investment is just pointed to the new business sets.
And then, more specifically to your question, what we look at is the opportunity set, the -- each one of these is different. When we start with cloud, as Sundar commented, given the core capabilities that we are building upon, our technical infrastructure, security app, machine learning, analytical tools, our view is that we’re addressing a rapidly growing market with the core pillars that are needed to win. And what has been the recurring theme that we’ve talked about on these calls is the need to further build out our go to market capabilities and ensure that we’ve got the functional requirements that enterprise customers deserver. So, it’s really looking at the scale of the opportunity, the pace of investment that can be done effectively and therefore position us well.
Our hardware business continues to deliver significant growth, particularly with the sales as a home family of products, and you’ve seen us invest there. We talked about the HTC acquisition last quarter because this is a scale business. And the ability to operate as effectively as possible underscores the types of investments we’re making. Play continues to benefit from broad-based app strength, it’s been a long standing strength of ours, and we’re continuing to invest as needed there.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney
Great, thanks. Two questions. It seems like your commentary on cloud is very positive. It seems like that’s also what we’re hearing from Microsoft. And my guess is from Amazon what they are seeing. Do you think we’re just at a broad industry inflection point in terms of cloud adoption, and any thoughts as to why we’re saying it now? And then, a question on advertising, there is just big bucket of ad spend called trade promotion spend, that’s largely been offline I think, and it’s almost as big maybe on a global basis as kind of traditional TV brand advertising. Any thoughts on that as an opportunity, whether there’s an ability for that to really migrate heavily online and Google’s ability to tap into those dollars? Thank you very much.
Sundar Pichai
On the first question on cloud. For sure, I do think there is an inflection point. And that’s why, it feels far from zero-sum game. I think all the major players are definitely seeing traction. And to me, the reason is, typically when you look at enterprises, once you’ve deployed and you have an architecture, you try and stay on it as long as you can in many, many cases, but this change is hard. But, this is a case in which the benefits are super clear. And over time, I think, there is a tremendous cost to your business of being on the wrong architecture, especially if you need to digitally transform yourself, thinking through the cloud architecture becomes an important way by which you are improving your business. So, I think at a foundational level, it’s clearly there on everyone’s mind. It’s not just on CEOs are asking questions about cloud. Almost all businesses I deal with, I can clearly see the question is on the mind of their CEO. And so, I think it’s important.
I also think it’s going to be -- businesses are going to embrace multiple clouds over time too. So, I think not only is this early, but I think it is going to transform. And there is a lot of opportunity here. And our goal here is, it’s something we view -- this is something we have built experience over 20 years. And we are thoughtfully gaining strengthen and committed to it for the very long term.
Ruth Porat
And then, in terms of kind of trends in advertising, to your question. We have talked about this quite a bit in the past, over 90% of commerce is still offline, and we do see a great opportunity for digital to play a bigger role in that and tap into our budgets, into other budgets that have traditionally been there. And so, we are quite focused on the advertising opportunities, as said. And the fact that ad budgets are offline, and as we focus on, these are opportunity and the tools for advertisers, we see view that as another opportunity.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Dan Salmon
Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Sundar, you mentioned in your prepared remarks or highlighted at least the launch of local campaigns at Marketing Live a couple of weeks ago. I recognize that’s an initiative that will help drive demand across a number of Google properties. I’m curious in particular about Maps, and with it being a product aimed at driving store visits, one would assume Maps would play an interesting part in that. And in the past, when we’ve asked you about Maps, it was focused more on getting the user experience right. So, my question is, do you see local campaigns as something that drives a bit of incremental level of monetization of Maps.
Sundar Pichai
Okay. I think it’s a good question. Local is an extraordinary use case in mobile. Local mobile searches are growing faster than mobile searches for us and have increased by almost 50% in the last year alone. And we are continuing to invest in building a local experience that benefits merchants, users and advertisers. And local campaigns is something new which we announced at Google Marketing Live a couple of weeks ago. It’s a new campaign where if you are a local business, it’s designed to drive foot traffic to you. You provide us with your budget, business locations and creatives, and we use machine learning to automatically optimize the ads to appear across our properties. Right? And along with that, you’ve rightly noticed that we are beginning to experiment with new ad format, which we have had in beta, but we’re pushing on them a bit more in Maps itself, both promoted places and place page ads.
So, these are important ways by which we are exploring the commercial opportunity around Maps. I’ve always felt Maps is a tremendous asset we have. And we’ve really focused on the user side of things. And we will continue to do so, because the growth is very, very high. So, we see a lot of headroom. But as that experience is -- as we get a better understand of it, we are developing our views on how we can bring monetization experiences. And so, these are all steps in that direction. But, we’ll take it’s slows and we’ll continue to evolve it here.
Operator
And our question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. 
Brent Thill
Ruth, the U.S. and Asia business has accelerated sequentially modestly, but Europe was down a touch. And I think there have been many questions around did GDPR have any impact, and Sundar said it was too early to call. But, is that just completely unrelated to what happened or maybe there is something else that’s going on that resulted from the small downtick?
Ruth Porat
Yes. I mean, the way we look at it is, we’re pleased with the strength in each of the regions at 19% year-on-year growth in EMEA and a fixed basis where we’re pleased with the strength in the business. And as Sundar said, I think it’s too early to comment on GDPR. We then hope that that’s geographic split gives you better sense of what’s kind of the dynamics in each of the various region. And as we both commented on, as long as you raise the regional question, I’ve got to comment on APAC here, really pleased with the growth, 34% on a fixed FX basis and it underscores Sundar’s comments about terrific products and rapidly growing markets, as well as the superb leadership group. Mobile strength is the key there as well, and we’re very pleased about the breadth by the country that we’re seeing, we’re very focused on the region. So, as we look across the globe, pleased with the fact that it is -- all regions are contributing nicely.
Brent Thill
And a quick follow-up for Sundar. You mentioned on the cloud business that you’re getting strong traction among some of the big fundamental institutions. One of the big questions we get is around the heavily regulated industries like healthcare, financial. It feels like you’re starting to get better referenceability there. Are you happy with where you sit across the more heavily regulated industries now versus the tech-focused industries where you sit right now?
Sundar Pichai
Definitely, and I think that’s where a lot of our investments have gone in, right, getting certifications needed, depending on the industry and building the features that you need. And that’s clearly starting to have an impact, and both on GCP, but as well as G Suite. And so, we definitely are going to continue to build out our capabilities. And we’ll be going after the opportunities in these areas very seriously.
Operator
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.
Colin Sebastian
I have a couple, maybe first going back to the commerce theme. I wanted to ask about Shopping Actions and level of adoption you might be seeing with that formats. And more generally, what do you envision monetization for Google Assistant, if we should still expect to see more of a transactional event to that platform? And then on TAC, in wonder if it’s worth adding a more color perhaps in the tiny or how much of the second quarter benefited from the moderation in growth in sites TAC just so we can get a better sense as to how to model that expense item over the next few quarters?
Sundar Pichai
Colin, on Google Assistant and Shopping Actions, there I do think it’s been exciting to see the improvement there, but I still would like that experience they’ve all a lot more before we play around with monetization. And in all of these areas, we always set a high bar to make sure the user experience is working well. You have seen us do that with Maps or something like that.
And I think today while we have taken promising steps with Shopping Actions for all of us to really work well and to delight users. I still feel we have some work ahead of us and that’s what we are focused on. So, we will stay focused there, get the experience and then that will give us new avenues to monetize it. I've seen this with YouTube now, beyond ads we are experimenting with a lot of new formats, and the same thing here. So, I am pretty confident of our ability to do that well, if we get the user experience right.
Ruth Porat
And then in terms of TAC, as we’ve talked about in the past TAC as a percentage of revenues is affected by quite a number of factors. The main point is that we do continue to expect the TAC rate to increase on a year-on-year basis. And the primary reason is when we talked about really in the past that it’s the underlying shift to mobile which carries higher TACs than desktop. So, on a year-on-year basis, that’s the trend that you are really seeing as the ongoing strength in mobile.
Over the past four quarters, changes in partnership agreements have also been a driver of increases in the TAC rate and then there are host of other factors that we’ve talked about they can have an impact in any quarter like device mix or partner mix or mix of organic and pay distribution points.
And so, as we called out last quarter, we did expect the pace of year-on-year growth in the sites TAC rate to slow beginning in this quarter, the second quarter, and you can clearly see that in the data. And as we’ve repeatedly said, it is most effective to focus on year-on-year changes given the significance of this shift to mobile and mobile growth. And so variations in quarter-on-quarter move are less instructive.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
Michael Nathanson
One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, firstly. You went through a lot of your initiatives in your opening comments, but didn’t mention Verily. So can you talk a bit about what the bottlenecks are then to be solved by you or your clients before you can scale the Verily opportunity? And then for Ruth, you’ve been clear on the CapEx ramp is due to you are investing ahead of growth. What is usual timeframe do you think, do you see where those investments to pay off? And what factors would make the CapEx to sale ratio start growing even faster from here? Those were my questions.
Sundar Pichai
Broadly, Verily is clearly set up us an other bet, and they are doing really important work on healthcare, if we look at the recent progress on their diabetes monitoring and so on. So they’re in deep work and they have a lot more talk about. Across healthcare, we see a big opportunity for both Google and Alphabet. It’s a vertical, which is very important for Cloud. And we are obviously helping a lot of healthcare partners across their needs. And Verily is definitely doing a very specialized solutions in this area. And we’ll have a lot more to say on all of this over the course of time.
Ruth Porat
And then, with respect to CapEx, look, I think, our view is that what you are saying here is an aggressive piece of investment, given our outlook for growth. And as I said the required additional Compute capacity, we are quite focused on the kind of full resource utilization across businesses. If I go back to couple of years when we incorporated stock-based compensation into the way we are talking about the businesses, I made the point that that is helpful, both externally and internally, and looking at resource utilization, the same is clearly true of CapEx. And we are quite focused on long-term value creation, focused on ensuring that we’re pursuing attractive opportunities in a prudent, appropriate way to capture the opportunity while making sure that we’re looking at the full again resource requirement. So, at this point, that’s an interesting way of framing the question, how does it grow even faster from here. We’re quite focused on this thing, an aggressive piece and an appropriate one, given the opportunities that we see, and it is a class data centers, machines and network infrastructure as I said.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post
Thank you. I just want to get into website growth. First, maybe you can help us a little bit understand strength in mobile search. Are there new any ad formats or ad changes? You mentioned local, anything to call out there? And then, just wondering, given the YouTube controversies last year, did YouTube accelerate this quarter? And what are some of the big content areas that you are investing in? Thank you.
Ruth Porat
So, in terms of sites revenue, I think, our view is ongoing strength reflects our focus on improving the user experience and enhancing tools for advertisers. And both Sundar and I have spoken about them. We’ve got an intense focus on innovation that we’ve discussed previously that’s enabled us to deliver over a 100 innovations each quarter. And really exciting area is the benefit of machine learning. It’s a valuable driver of our growth, not only enhancing experiences for users but the tools that we talked about for advertisers and for app developers, certainly helping them find the right audience, to be able to optimize campaigns at scale, to deliver more relevant and higher quality ads. Sundar talked about a number of them. The Google Marketing Live, we’ve really highlighted what we’re seeing there and the benefits, whether we’re talking about responsive search ads or local campaigns, smart shopping campaigns, another great example is universal app campaigns. So, across the board. And again, I made this comment previously about the benefit we’re seeing on mobile is extending to the growth opportunities across platforms.
Sundar Pichai
Yes. And I’d add that a good way to think about it is, today, there is a lot of complexity you need to deal with to have advertiser, and increasingly we are using machine learning to do all the hard work and get them to focus on the business problem they are trying to solve. And that turns out to be a big driver overall.
On YouTube, we definitely are continuing to see great product momentum, it’s the user adoption and interest and our metrics are very strong, continues to grow and the growth is global. And we see it across many, many verticals. And overall, we’ve invested a lot in making sure we are delivering the content responsibly. And it’s been a big area of focus across Google. We are investing a lot in people to review the content that’s going, improving the policies. And again, using machine learning to make all of this work better. And I think people are noticing it including our advertisers and they’re engaging with the platform more. So, I would say overall, there is a lot of momentum there. And I’m excited about it.
Operator
Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.

As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today.
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you, Ellen. We delivered ongoing strong revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency. The sustained outstanding performance in sites revenues, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth, with mobile search again leading the way. Robust growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. Ongoing substantial growth in other revenues, namely cloud, hardware and Play, continues to highlight the growing contribution of our non-ads opportunities. 
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. As we highlighted in our earnings press release, our results this quarter were affected by a new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. I'll highlight the impact on particular line items as I review the quarter. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions. 
Starting with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $31.1 billion were up 26% year-over-year. We realized the positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $1.3 billion or $1.1 billion after the impact of our hedging program. 
Turning to Alphabet's revenue by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.5 billion, up 29% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 21%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $4.8 billion, up 33% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Australian dollar. Other America revenues were $1.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year and up 35% in constant currency. 
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.5 billion, up 37% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.2 billion, up 39% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were, first, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which was affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses primarily from G&A; second, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and finally, hardware related costs. 
Operating expenses were $10.7 billion, up 27% year-over-year, with the biggest increase in R&D expenses reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects advertising investments in cloud and hardware as well as the Assistant. 
G&A expense trends were affected this quarter by a number of factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues and the benefit of the Uber litigation settlement. 
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.5 billion. The quarter-on-quarter step-up reflects the full year equity refresh grant to employees at the beginning of the quarter and the biannual grant to SVPs. 
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 85,050, up 4,940 people from last quarter, including just over 2,000 people who joined at the end of January when we closed our previously announced deal with HTC. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were the additions from HTC followed by hiring and cloud for both technical and sales roles. 
Operating income was $7 billion, up 7% versus last year, and the operating margin was 22%. Other income and expense was $3.5 billion, which includes $3 billion of primarily unrealized gains in equity security investments recognized under the new accounting standard. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our effective tax rate was 11% for the first quarter. As outlined in our earnings press release, this includes a 5 percentage point reduction from the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which offset the income tax expense on the equity security gains. 
Net income was $9.4 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $13.33. As indicated in the table in our earnings press release, these results reflect an increase in net income of $2.4 billion and $3.40 in earnings per diluted share due to the impact from the gains in equity security investments we've already discussed. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.3 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $11.6 billion with free cash flow of $4.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $103 billion. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $31 billion, up 26% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year, led again by mobile search complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. 
Network revenues were $4.6 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $4.4 billion, up 36% year-over-year fueled by cloud, hardware and Play. As a reminder, the hardware revenues in this line now include our Nest business, and prior periods were restated. 
We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. As we previously announced, we made a change this quarter to impression-based monetization metrics for our network business given the ongoing growth of programmatic. 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenues and up 36% year-over-year. This year-on-year increase in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. The underlying trend affecting the network TAC rate year-over-year continues to be the shift to programmatic, which carries higher TAC. 
Google's stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $8.4 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 27%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.7 billion, reflecting investments in facilities, production equipment and data center construction. Facilities was the largest component of CapEx of this quarter due primarily to the $2.4 billion purchase of Chelsea Market that we announced in March. 
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $150 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. As a reminder, Nest results are now reported as part of the Google segment, with revenues reflected in the Google other revenues line. Operating loss was $571 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $55 million. 
We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. At Waymo, we have achieved 5 million miles of driving on city streets, adding the latest million in just 3 months. We also announced a long-term partnership with Jaguar Land Rover for their fully electric I-PACE vehicles. Verily is seeing good progress with Onduo, its joint venture with Sanofi. The companies made its diabetes management platform commercially available in 3 states with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas and South Carolina and Anthem's health plan in Georgia. 
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. The opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary, and we remain focused on investment to support long-term revenue and profit growth. We have both the business confidence to invest appropriately in the next phase of innovation as well as clarity about some very compelling opportunities that, in our judgment, will enable us to create shareholder value. We're pleased with the continued momentum of our revenue growth again this quarter, reflecting strong underlying trends across our business, which are amplified by our relentless focus on innovation, not only in our newer businesses, like cloud and hardware, but in our sites business. Specifically, we're excited by the still sizable opportunity in search advertising led by mobile. At 26% year-on-year revenue growth in our sites business, we continue to benefit from our investments to enhance the user and advertiser experience. 
Second, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenues, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we continue to anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues, will slow beginning in this second quarter. 
Within OpEx, as I said last quarter, we are continuing to support our priority investment areas. Within R&D, this is reflected in increased headcount, particularly for technical roles. Sales and marketing is similarly elevated to support these areas, both in the quarter and for the full year, and we expect expenses to remain more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season. 
As you've seen in prior quarters, G&A can be a more difficult line to forecast. In particular, this quarter, we had the impact of the accrual for performance fees related to the equity gains previously discussed, partially offset by the reallocation of some expenses to other cost of revenues and the Uber legal settlement. We appreciate the importance of prioritization and are keenly focused on the steps we can take to make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns. 
For our Other Bets, we remain focused on moving toward commercial applications in a number of areas with a continued focus on calibrating investment to metrics for success. 
Third, with respect to CapEx. Our commitment to growth is evident in the trend in CapEx investment, almost equally split this quarter between compute capacity and facilities. Our facilities spent in Google dominated by the Chelsea Market acquisition reflects that we favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities. With respect to compute capacity, the largest component of CapEx is for machines that incorporate the latest technologies. We are also investing in data center growth and increased network capacity through undersea cables. These combined investments will expand our compute capacity to support our growth outlook across Google, including machine learning, the Assistant and cloud. 
In many respects, these investments underscore my opening comment about both our confidence and clarity about future opportunities with our focus on proprietary solutions that enable us to deliver the secure, reliable, high-performing compute infrastructure to support new and emerging products and services for our users, advertisers and enterprise customers. 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Ruth. The end of Q1 is always an exciting time as we prepare for our annual developer conference, Google I/O. Computing is evolving at a rapid rate, and we can't wait to share what's next and how we are tackling important issues. I want to call out an important highlight from Q1, the Google news initiative that we unveiled in March. Over the years, we have worked closely with the news industry to address key challenges through projects like Accelerated Mobile Pages. We are building on that partnership with the $300 million investment to elevate and strengthen quality journalism. As part of this effort, we announced more than a dozen new products, including Subscribe with Google developed in close collaboration with publishers, which lets you use your Google account to buy a subscription on participating news sites. We've had overwhelming interest. 
Since the launch, we have heard from more than 300 news publishers who are interested in Subscribe with Google. We also introduced new tools for journalists and improvements to our platforms to ensure that we are surfacing accurate quality content where it matters most. 
Today, I'll quickly talk about how machine learning is helping us advance that mission, then I'll highlight progress in our 3 big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardware, and share updates on our computing and advertising platforms. 
First, machine learning and making information accessible to everyone. Our own ML-powered products like Google Photos and Google Lens gets better every day. The Google Assistant is a great example of this. In the home, we have added over 200 new device partners that work with Assistant just on the last 4 months alone. We now partner with all major manufacturers of connected devices for the home in the U.S. 
All told, the Google Assistant can now help you with over 1 million actions, including new things like reminding you to buy bread when you get to the store or sending money to friends or if you want to get a ride share home. For a concept we unveiled at I/O less than 2 years ago, this is great progress. 
AI is also unlocking new opportunities for everyone. Just in the last few months, we have seen some amazing applications from dairy farmers in Georgia using TensorFlow to improve the health their herds to our own Google researchers who figured out how to use ML techniques to assess a person's risk of a heart attack. The possibilities of AI in health care are truly exciting. 
At our recent TensorFlow summit, we introduced TensorFlow hub, making it easier for developers to share and reuse models so that we can work together to tackle even more problems and get to better ideas faster. Our investments in this area are helped because of our specialized Tensor Processing Units, which are specifically designed to be highly efficient for machine learning applications. 
Of course, we continue to advance Google's core mission in other ways, too. We recently launched our Google Go app in 26 African countries. This app reduces the amount of data needed to display search results by 40%, and we continue to invest in ways to give people granular and easy controls over their information across all our products. Every single day, nearly 20 million people visit My Account, which gives them options to review their Google security, privacy and ad settings. Additionally, tools like security checkup and privacy checkup prompt people to keep their account secure and control their data settings. 
Now turning to our three big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardware. Last quarter, we shared some exciting metrics about the progress of Google Cloud, including that we passed $1 billion per quarter in 2017. In Q1, we saw increasing momentum. We are growing across the board and are also signing significantly larger, more strategic deals for cloud. Our security capabilities, the easy-to-use advanced data analytics and machine learning solutions and the secure and industry-leading collaboration platform, G Suite, are winning customers over. Google Cloud is growing well. Some examples of new technologies announced in the quarter include Cloud AutoML, which makes it easier for companies without machine learning expertise to build complex neural nets and more than 20 new security products. 
Our global infrastructure continues to expand to support demand. We commissioned 3 new subsea cables and announced new regions in Canada, Japan, Netherlands and Saudi Arabia, bringing our total of recently launched and upcoming regions to 20. 
G Suite has reached a point where it can serve all the needs of a large enterprise, and as a result, grow at a certain inflection point. The Suite is growing from strength to strength. We believe our secure environment is an important factor in driving enterprise customer wins. G Suite customers like Colgate-Palmolive Company tell us that no one offers a better combination of hardware, network and data security. In Q1, we also signed agreements with customers like Airbus and Thailand's Krung Thai Bank. As a result, G Suite revenue growth accelerated in Q1. 
Next, YouTube. The platform continues to grow as millions of creators build communities and find opportunity on YouTube. Over the last year, channels earnings 6 figures annually grew more than 40%. This quarter, Dua Lipa's video for New Rules became the 100th video on YouTube to reach 1 billion views. We are also investing in new experiences like life content, where we see tremendous momentum. One recent example was our exclusive Coachella live stream, which had more than 41 million live views from all over the world. 
Coachella was YouTube's most viewed live music festival ever. And no surprise, Beyoncé was the most viewed Coachella performance ever on YouTube. Even as we invest in new experiences, we stay very focused on making sure that YouTube remains a safe platform with great content. We are aggressively combating content that violates our strict policies through a combination of user and machine flags. Over 6 million videos removed in Q4 were first flagged by our machine systems, and over 75% of those videos were removed before receiving a single view. We also changed our monetization requirements to better identify creators who contribute positively to the community and drive more ad revenue to them. 
Moving to hardware. This quarter, we welcome Nest of the Google hardware team to supercharge our efforts. Nest is building industry-leading products for the home, including new additions like the Nest Hello doorbell and Nest temperature sensor. In 2017, they sold more devices than the previous 2 years combined. They are an incredibly talented team with fantastic momentum. 
Google Home continues to be super popular, and we are making it available in many more countries. Just recently, we launched Google Home in many -- in India and Singapore, and the response has been terrific. 
Our early 2018 Net Promoter Scores rank among the highest in the industry across all product categories. This shows how much love people have for Made by Google consumer hardware devices and makes us even more excited for what's ahead. 
There's great momentum across our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome. At Mobile World Congress, a new generation of Android partner devices was introduced, including Android One phones like the Nokia 7 plus. Android One pairs high-quality hardware with a secured and streamlined software and experience from Google. This quarter, we launched the Acer Chromebook Tab 10, the first Chrome OS tablet designed specifically for education. It is a secure and easily shareable tablet equipped with all the Chromebook features that educators and students love. 
And finally, our advertising platforms. We continue to make Google Search and Shopping the best places for people to find and buy products from a range of merchants. We recently announced shopping actions, allowing customers to easily buy from their choice of participating retailers on the Google Assistant and Search with the universal card across mobile, desktop and even Google Home. The results are really helping retailers. Early testing showed that participating retailers see an average increase in basket size of about 30%. 
YouTube is delivering great results for our advertisers. To help brands reach broad audiences on YouTube with even more flexibility, we introduced TrueView for Reach, which optimizes in stream ads to reach a wide audience. In beta testing, 9 out of 10 campaigns drove a significant lift in ad recall, with an average lift of nearly 20%. 
We are also helping small businesses take advantage of video with the expansion of YouTube Director onsite to over 170 U.S. cities. This gives SMBs access to a professional filmmaker to create and edit their video ads. 
Finally, we remain focused on investing in our publisher partners. Last year, we paid $12.6 billion to publishing partners in our ad network. We recently announced AdSense Auto ads. This uses machine learning to analyze ad placements on a publisher's page and show ads when they are likely to perform well while providing a good user experience. 
Google's success depends not just on the success of our partners but also on the community's very work. We recently announced the Rolling Study Halls program for rural areas across 12 states. It equips school buses with Wi-Fi devices and onboard educators so that students with long commutes can get their homework done during the trip. 
We are also making long-term investments in our offices and data centers around the country. Last month, we announced the purchase of Manhattan's Chelsea Market building. And in Tennessee and Alabama, we broke ground on 2 new data centers, which will have a big economic impact on the local economies. These investments are made hand-in-hand with our commitment to sustainability. 
In 2017, we officially met our goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all electricity consumed by our operations around the world. 
I want to close by saying thank you to our employees. It's been a particularly tough few weeks for the Google family, especially at YouTube. I'm so proud of the resilience that our employees have shown, and I'm so grateful for the support we have gotten across the industry and from the community. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth
Ruth, just first on the accounting change, I was just hoping you could clarify. If we're trying to normalize that, is it right that we would be adding back about $632 million to operating income and then reducing EPS by $3.40, and then just on the EPS side, perhaps adjusting for the tax rate? And then just in terms of the business, I just wanted to ask about Waymo. If you could talk a little bit about just the latest timing for the commercial launch in Phoenix and how quickly you'd look to expand to other markets, and then just how you're thinking about the technology and whether you'll license it to others going forward or keep it more proprietary for Waymo services?
Ruth Porat
Sure. So on the accounting standard, we try to lay out all the component parts clearly on the cover of the earnings release so that you would have it all in one place. I think you summarized it right, but I'll just direct everybody to the earnings release. The net of which was the gain from the equity investments was $2.4 billion to net income. That is net of performance fees as well as the release of a deferred tax asset that we have, so it does reflect $3 billion in gains. And I think you know this, but this quarter, the accounting standard requires marks for everything where there is an observable raise.
So these are unrealized -- the majority of them are unrealized, not actually monetized by Alphabet, and then the performance fees are calculated based on investment returns. They're accrued but not paid until an exit event occurs, and they do appear in OpEx. And as you noted, there is also, therefore, the benefit that flows through on the tax line, and that is 5 percentage points of benefit offset to the effective tax rate for the quarter. As it relates to your Waymo question, there was a lot in there. We do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts. It is still very early. In terms of our progress, this year is about offering a service that is safe, that works, that delight users in the Phoenix area. The rider program in Phoenix is open to members of the public, and riders will use a Waymo app to hail one of our fully self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel, and will pay for the service. We've also had progress on the vehicle partnerships, as I mentioned in my opening comments. Last month, Waymo announced it signed a long-term strategic partnership with Jaguar beginning with a collaboration to design and manufacture self-driving I-PACE vehicles for Waymo's transportation service. These are all electric cars.
This new partnership in the vehicles adds to our strong position with FCA, and the production of the cars begins in 2020. And then we are expanding our testing to more states. We're also working on additional areas like applying the technology to logistics and deliveries and working with cities to help strengthen public transportation and for personal use vehicles. And as we've talked about on a bunch of calls, the opportunity is here for us because we started with safety, and we remain a leader in safety, and we do believe that's the foundation for success, and it builds on the -- all the testing miles that we've done. So we keep coming back to when you create vehicles that drive themselves faithfully, we think there's a lot of potential uses and business opportunities, and that's what we're focused on.
Operator
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini
I wanted to ask two quick questions. One, just one on GDPR then one on cloud. On GDPR, just wondering if you could share with us kind of any impact you're thinking about as the implementation occurs later in May, and so any thoughts you could share there would be great. And then on cloud, Sundar, you had mentioned you're seeing a lot of momentum. You said G Suite, I believe, accelerated in Q1. I was wondering if there was any color on the GCP side that you could share from a growth perspective if that business accelerated or not and kind of how were the deal sites trending for that business in particular.
Sundar Pichai
Great. Maybe I'll do the GDPR first. GDPR, I realize, is a fairly new public OPEC. But for us, it's not new. We started working on GDPR compliance over 18 months ago and have been very, very engaged on it. It's really important, and we care about getting it right. And overall, we have long had a very robust and strong privacy program at Google, too. So we are committed to meeting requirements on May 25 and also long term. We are working very closely with advertisers, publishers and our partners. And we will also update all the privacy policies and controls we provide to users worldwide. So it's a big effort. We are very committed to it. We are very focused on getting it right by our users and partners, and that's where our focus is now. On -- Heather, on cloud, I guess your question was about overall growth, and we are continuing -- the momentum has been very strong on cloud as well. We haven't talked about G Suite much, and so we highlighted it the moment I'm there, but cloud is continuing its great growth. We are seeing it across the board. Things worth I would call out is we are seeing larger deals as well. We are seeing good synergies between G Suite and cloud. Areas where we have done acquisitions like Apigee, they are beginning to work in terms of driving synergies to cloud. And the efforts we are beginning to put particular with our partners, that is beginning to bear fruit as well. So we have go-to-market programs now with SAP, Cisco and Salesforce. And I think we are beginning to see early results from that, and hopefully, that translates into more momentum going forward.
Operator
And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
Eric Sheridan
Maybe two for Sundar, if I can. One, on mobile search, continue to call that out as a point of strength in the results. What are you most excited about in terms of either the product innovation or the ability to get consumers to adopt mobile search more broadly on devices globally, which could lead to more ad budgets moving it to mobile search? And then on hardware, you've now been through 2 years of sort of Pixel devices. You've made the aqui-hire of ETC engineers. Can you give us a sense of what you've learned so far from your hardware efforts and how that might evolve product innovation or go-to-market strategies long term?
Sundar Pichai
On mobile search, for me, mobile obviously raises the bar. And if you look at the evolution of Search, we gave from -- we evolved to stay ahead of user expectations, and we evolved from just providing links to answers. I just feel at a high level the next big evolution we are doing as part of mobile search and assistant is to actually help users complete actions, to help get things done. And it's really hard to do at scale, and that's the work we are doing. And as we do that, it'll impact just -- not just the Assistant but mobile search more broadly. And obviously, that has a commercial impact as well. So we continue to be very excited about the opportunities there. On hardware, the exciting part for us is now, I think we have all the end-to-end capabilities of a world-class hardware organization, along with the quality of the software organizations we have always had. And in this area, it truly takes long-term planning. And so for example, if you think about silicon, et cetera, the longer you can do it, the more advantages you have. And so I definitely feel we are taking the steps towards being able to do this well for the long term. Part of that obviously involves scaling of our go-to-market strategies both in the U.S. and internationally so that we can drive adoption. I said earlier, our Net Promoter Scores show that we are right up there with the best-in-class devices and across all the products we have, not just our Pixel, across our Nest family and everything we do. So the opportunity is clearly there. We're going to lean into it, and it takes two to three years to really get to the scale where we want to see it and -- but we are committed to getting there.

And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney
I want to follow up on Heather's question on GDPR, and the question I want to ask is, I understand that you're -- been working for a long time to make sure that you're compliant. But do you think that GDPR or other regulation that you see on the horizon is likely to impact materially the targeting capabilities about that advertisers have on Google? Is there something in the regulation that's going to make Google and its properties less attractive to advertisers? That's the action question I want to ask.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Mark. Above everything else, as we are working through GDPR, we are making sure we are focused on getting the user experience right for our users and our partners. But to clarify your question further, first of all, it's important to understand that most of our ad business is Search, where we rely on very limited information, essentially what is in the keywords to show a relevant ad or product. And so we've been preparing this for 18 months, and I think we are focused on getting the compliance right. It'll be a year's long effort, and we are helping not just us but our publishers and partners. But overall, we think we'll be able to do all that with the positive impact for users and publishers and the advertisers and so our business.
Operator
And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak
I have two. The first one on desktop search. So it's nice to hear that your oldest business is still growing. Just curious, could you give 1 or 2 tangible examples or products that are still driving the desktop search growth? And Sundar, I understand you're always focused on user experience. At a high level, what do you see is the biggest areas potential further improvement in desktop search? And let me ask you the same question about YouTube. What are sort of the biggest areas of tension that you're focused on improving from a user perspective on YouTube right now?
Sundar Pichai
So on desktop search -- sorry, is your question on the user experience on desktop search, how do we see improvements? Look, I mean, the same. First of all, users are having cross-device experiences, cross-screen experiences, right? So I think your desktop search experience, mobile search, everything goes hand-in-hand. And every -- all the work we are doing to make mobile search better translates to desktop search as well. Areas where desktop search historically has been a bit behind is in terms of things like identity and payments and having all that work well to enhance the user experience. And with Chrome now, we are investing a lot in those areas as well, and I think that will contribute overall to improvements there. On YouTube, there are many, many areas we are focused on YouTube. They're always very focused on making sure they are supporting emerging formats, be it mobile live streaming or emerging formats like VR, and so that's an area of focus for us. We are also really looking at what are all-new monetization options for creators beyond advertising. So be it subscriptions, features like super chat, which we have launched, are very popular. We have beta testing sponsorships, merchandise, merchandising and concept, ticketing and et cetera, right? So these are all areas by which we are improving. And obviously, there are additional areas like Music and YouTube TV, which are seeing great momentum as well.
Operator
And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays.
Ross Sandler
Just two questions, please. Americas revenue accelerated nicely on a currency neutral basis. It's a geography that rarely comes up on your calls. So any color about what's driving that acceleration and the sustainability of what's going on in the Americas region? And then, Ruth, a question on sites TAC. So I know you said the pace of deleverage is going to start to improve next quarter. Is this something that we should expect to happen for a year and then kind of normalize back to pretty steady pace of deleverage? Or is this -- are we over some critical threshold, and we should see this trend of moderating deleverage continue for several years into the future?
Ruth Porat
So on your first question, other Americas. I would say, like the other regions, really pleased with the strength we have. Across the regions, it is obviously one of the smaller ones, so growing at a slightly faster clip and really pleased with the broad strength there. It starts with the sites revenue strength. But on top of that, they benefited from hardware devices launching in some additional markets over the past year. And then in terms of TAC, I would say there's not much to add to what we've already said after some -- a kind of sustained period of stronger increases. We were pleased last quarter to be able to signal that this quarter that pace of change is slowing, and just leave it at that for now.
Operator
And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore.
Anthony DiClemente
I have two, one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, on CapEx, even if we exclude the Chelsea Market one-timer, the gross in CapEx, is it really substantial even on a kind of recurring basis. Should we expect that sort of dramatic growth or step-up in the growth of rate in ongoing CapEx to continue throughout the year? Or other than the Chelsea Market one-timer, were there any -- do we have any reason to think that it was timing in terms of the timing, front-end weighted, it's the first quarter for CapEx? And then secondly on -- Sundar, just a question on YouTube and your media strategy at a higher level. In view of the success of other competitive subscription TV products out there, Internet video products, can you just talk about YouTube Red and any thoughts on ways you can accelerate growth for your YouTube subscription video products, whether that may be organic investment and content original production or even via acquisition?
Ruth Porat
So in terms of CapEx, it's about equally split between facilities and our technical infrastructure. And as you know that we have the $2.4 billion purchase in New York as well as discontinued ground-up development projects. Facilities does tend to be lumpier over time. We are continuing with the ground-up development projects. And as a reminder, we do favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities, and that has served us well over the years. But I think more to your question with respect to technical infrastructure, that reflects investments in compute power to support growth that we see across Google, and the largest component is on machines. It's also on data centers and undersea cables. And on machines, the biggest contributor is the demand that we're seeing. So in particular, it's the expanding application of the machine learning efforts across Alphabet, plus the requirements for cloud and Search and YouTube, and then secondarily, the increased cost of newer technologies, CPUs, memory, network. So I think, really, to answer your question most directly, it reflects the demand that we're seeing, so I wouldn't want to suggest a one-off in terms of the investments we're making in technical infrastructure. And then in terms of the data centers, we are investing globally. We currently have over 20 sites on 4 continents, and that's under different stages of construction, as Sundar noted. And it's across the U.S. Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, Iowa. So we're really building out to support the growth that we're seeing.
Sundar Pichai
Sorry, on the second question on YouTube, for sure, the adoption and feedback across both YouTube Red and YouTube Music has been great to see. We are doing a lot more work there. You will see us continue to invest further and develop those offerings better, and as part of that, further drive adoption. So for example, YouTube Originals end up playing a big part in YouTube Red subscriptions. And so far, we have launched in a handful of markets, and we'll continue to roll it out to more markets there. And on YouTube Music, we are working on enhancing the product, and I think this definitely create opportunities there as well.
Operator
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
Daniel Salmon
Sundar, I had two for you. First, during the quarter, where there were some reports of changes in leadership that your Search and AI divisions functionally sounds like separating leadership over those 2 very large, important businesses for the company. Could you talk a little bit more about that and how that may impact broader strategy for the company? And then second, a little bit more technical one on your advertising business you launched, shopping actions during the quarter with a pay-per-sale model, pricing model. And I was just curious to hear what type of feedback you were getting from advertisers that led to a product with that pricing model in particular, any other features of shopping actions that you think are important to highlight.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Dan. Search has been leading the company in terms of how they have been adopting machine learning and AI, and it's really working well through Search and Assistant. We sense that, obviously, as an AI-first company, AI cuts across everything we do in Google. And so as an organization, it's a horizontal organization, which needs to serve all our areas and in some ways, the change reflects that. And we have very capable leaders. Jeff, who runs -- was the Founder of Google Brain and really well positioned to lead our AI efforts. And Ben has been at Google since the early days of Search, started in Google in 2000 and has been driving Search for over 18 years. And so we are very excited, and we think the changes will serve the company well. On your second thing, the question was on shopping actions?
Daniel Salmon
And in particular, the price per sale pricing model.
Sundar Pichai
So I think we announced the -- this new service in March, and the feedback has been very positive. I mentioned earlier, which is for retailers, when they are testing this, they see it drives an increase in basket size. So that means users are interacting with the product well, and that's all I have to share for now. It's still early days.
Operator
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird.
Colin Sebastian
A couple for me, please. First, on the cloud business. I was wondering if you could provide any color, at least in the relative momentum you're seeing in that segment from infrastructure services compared to platform or software services. And then related to the adoption of AMP. I guess, a key question we get asked is whether that ultimately changes usage, and maybe you have some perspective on this from Android. But in the ecosystem between mobile web pages and app usage, if you're seeing any shift among users between those formats.
Sundar Pichai
On the first question of cloud, look, I mean, I think the main thing I would say is the fundamental drivers of adoption of Google Cloud based on what we hear back from customers is our advantage in data analytics and machine learning. The fact that we really support open, agile development environment. Kubernetes has literally become the standard for workloads and the fact that we are open in terms of how we approach this space. Security is becoming a big differentiator for us and something we've been leading for a while, and I think that's driving it. G Suite, as I called out earlier, is a good synergistic driver. G Suite is doing well, and clearly, a very unique offering, and it's gotten very comprehensive. And so I think overall, it comes together well. On your second question around AMP, AMP has been definitely very successful. It's really made publisher content much more friendly for users in terms of latency and the user experience, and hence, that option has been great. For sure, AMP has definitely helped the mobile web, and that's part of the big reasons we did it. Mobile web is still a big part of how users consume content, especially around news, and so us investing there clearly makes a difference. I guess, for example, when we look at, I don't know, J.Crew adopted AMP, their mobile page loading times are now over 90% faster. And now they are integrating the Google payment request API. That reduces checkout times from 2 minutes to 30 seconds or so. So things like that. We are going to constantly stay on improving the mobile web, and that plays a big part in how our ecosystem works.
Operator
And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.
Michael Nathanson
I have two, one for Sundar, one for Ruth. First, Sundar, can you give us any sense of how Google Home consumers are using Search in these devices differently than maybe the traditional ways of Search? And you're finding in those homes, is it additive to overall search activity? And then for Ruth, if you look at the last page of press release, where you've shown the new monetization metrics, you see a real increase in the cost per impression on network sites. So can you talk about maybe what's happening there? Is there a mix shift types of publishers, types of products? Or is that just market inflation?
Sundar Pichai
Look, for sure, Google Home gives rise to a lot of new and unique use cases, actions that are a big part of it. Call mom is a good example of something you say to Google Home a lot. I can -- which is different than what you would say to Search. We see this as a good complementary thing. You will see Search embrace some of the capabilities you find in Google Assistant and Google Home and vice versa. And so overall, I view this as additive in the long term, and we are definitely just getting started there.
Ruth Porat
And then on the network monetization trends. First, just to give people a bit more color. When we launched the AdSense businesses, our network revenues were largely click-based. And over time, there's been a meaningful mix change in our business given the strong growth in programmatic, which is impression-based. So as a result, the shift now covers more of the business. And then in terms of the question on impression growth versus CPM growth, as we've discussed on prior calls, the network business is actually a number of different businesses. And then within that, we have flat year-on-year growth in the number of impressions that was driven by efforts to improve user experience through a reduction of less relevant ads and AFC. And so these changes had a positive impact on the year-on-year growth in CPMs. And then the trend and impressions in CPMs can clearly be volatile from quarter-to-quarter as we're optimizing for the user publisher and advertiser, but it really goes to the efforts that we make.
Operator
And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies.
Brent Thill
Just as a question regarding any changes on your framework for growth versus operating margins. The last few quarters, you've seen steady top line acceleration, yet the margins were down. Can you just talk about how you think about it at a high level for this year? Any changes from the past?
Ruth Porat
Yes, it's an important question. As we've talked about on many, many calls, we have been and remain focused on supporting long-term revenue and profit growth, and we think the opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary. And as I said in opening comments, just given our confidence and as we're looking forward, we want to make sure we're investing appropriately in the next phase of innovation, and we have clarity about some very compelling opportunities. And then our judgment, that enables us to maximize shareholder value. So we're taking the steps really to put in place the support for long-term -- longer-term growth. Part of what I'm saying, you can see in our sites revenue growth, try to make that clear in opening comments, we see this consistent, strong momentum globally, and we're really excited about the still sizable opportunity led by mobile search. And so we're continuing to invest to enhance the user and advertiser experience, and thereby, extend the growth in our ads business. You can see this also in the trend on the CapEx spend.
As I noted in our opening comments, the investments we're making there really provide the compute capacity to support our growth outlook, and that's supporting the opportunities that come out of machine learning and the Assistant. And then we also see extraordinary upside in the newer markets, as Sundar has talked about, most notably cloud computing and hardware. And so we're investing to support the long-term growth opportunity there. And then finally, when we look at the market opportunity in both self-driving cars and life sciences, our judgment is it makes sense to place the kinds of investments that we are. And with all of this, what also hasn't changed is we appreciate the importance of prioritization and picking our spots, and we're keenly focused on steps we can take to both make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns. So at a high level, the approach hasn't changed. You're seeing the investments here.
Operator
And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Crédit Suisse.
Stephen Ju
So Sundar, I think one of the themes that you as a management team has talked about has been to, I guess, democratize advertising with AI to help SMBs who may have found advertising across Google's ad products to be perhaps overwhelming. So can you talk about the rate of uptake among the smaller advertisers and whether or not this is helping to catalyze growth in new budgets and where these guys might otherwise have not been able to advertise before? There's SMBs and then there's local also. So what will be the plan to get this technology into the hands of folks who will want to use them?
Sundar Pichai
Look, I mean, there's a big focus for us. And today, SMBs are -- play a big role in our ecosystem, and we are doing a lot of stuff to support them across the board, right, and from things like in our offerings to help SMBs get an online presence, create a website, be discovered in local, search and Google Maps. So we do a lot of detailed work to make sure SMBs are working well. We are also doing a lot of stuff on local as well, including efforts that are even around local services. So we have very specific initiatives. This is going to be -- I mean, it's actually -- to us, it's bread and butter of what we do here, and so there's a lot of effort underway, not to mention the fact that we provide G Suite for businesses as they scale up as well. So it's an end-to-end offering, and we'll -- you'll continue to see us invest more here.

As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today.
And now, I’ll turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thanks, Ellen.
We had a fantastic 2017 with total revenues of $110.9 billion, up 23% over 2016 and operating income of $28.9 billion up 22% year-on-year excluding the EC fine. Our momentum reflects the relentless focus on users, advertisers and enterprise customers as well as the benefits of our commitment to long-term investing.
For the fourth quarter, revenues of $32.3 billion were up 24% year-on-year. The ongoing very strong performance in sites revenue in particular reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way. Healthy growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. Substantial growth in other revenues, mainly hardware, cloud and Play continues to highlight the benefits of our investments.
Our outline for today’s call is, first, I’ll view the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. In order to facilitate comparisons of this quarter’s results to prior periods, we have also provided the tax affected line items, excluding the impact of the U.S. tax legislation enacted at the end of 2017. You can see the components in our earnings press release.
Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.
Starting with the summary of Alphabet’s consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues of $32.3 billion were up 24% year-over-year and strong across all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.4 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.3 billion, up 24% year-over-year. In fixed FX terms, EMEA grew 22%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $4.7 billion, up 30% versus last year and up 32% in fixed FX terms, reflecting weakening of the Japanese yen. Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 30% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strengthening of the Canadian dollar.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I’ll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 34% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically, costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, hardware-related costs for our expanded Made by Google family of products and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
Operating expenses were $10.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year, in particular, reflecting an increase in marketing spend, given the holiday season. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 80,110, up 2,009 people from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count additions were once again made in cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business.
Operating income was $7.7 billion, up 15% versus last year, and the operating margin was 24%. Other income and expense was $354 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our provision for income taxes on a reported basis includes $9.9 billion for items associated with the U.S. tax legislation, resulting in a reported net loss of $3 billion and loss per diluted share of $4.35. Excluding the impact of the U.S. tax legislation, our effective tax rate was 15%. Our net income was $6.8 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.70.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $4.3 billion. Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion with free cash flow of $6 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $31.9 billion, up 24% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22.2 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
Network revenues were $5 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $4.7 billion, up 38% year-over-year, fueled by hardware, cloud and Play. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.5 billion or 24% of total advertising revenues and up 33% year-over-year. The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The underlying trend affecting the network TAC rate year-over-year continues to be the shift to programmatic which carries higher TAC.
Google’s stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the year, up 1% year-over-year. Operating income was $8.8 billion, up 11% versus last year and the operating margin was 27%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. I’ll cover results for the full-year 2017 because it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon, as discussed on prior calls. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release.
For the full-year 2017, Other Bets revenues were $1.2 billion, up 49% versus 2016, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss was $3.4 billion for the full-year 2017 versus an operating loss of $3.6 billion in 2016. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $507 million, down from $1.4 billion in 2016, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber. We’re pleased with our progress across Other Bets.
A couple of updates. Nest turned in a strong holiday performance in the fourth quarter across an expanded family of products in energy, safety and security. In 2017, Nest products also became available in 12 new countries, more than double the number in 2016. Verily wrapped up its first field study seeking to reduce the transmission of the diseases through mosquitoes with positive results. And just last week, Onduo, a joint venture between Verily and Sanofi began a limited commercial launch of its diabetes management platform.
At Waymo, progress is accelerating. For example, Waymo surpassed 4 million miles of driving in the real world, taking only six months to achieve the last million miles compared to that 18 months for our first million miles. And in November, Waymo announced that it is the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous without anyone in the driver’s seat.
Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer term outlook. Our 23% revenue growth in 2017 was powered in particular by the ongoing extraordinary performance of our sites business. Both mobile and desktop search continue to grow and benefit from our approach to innovation with strong momentum as we identify additional opportunities to enhance the user and advertiser experience.
As we’ve consistently emphasized, alongside the continued momentum in our advertising business, we are focused on building a second wave of growth within Google over the medium and long-term which includes the rapidly growing revenue businesses in Google, cloud, hardware and YouTube. With respect to cloud, we’re seeing the benefits of a fully featured enterprise offering and an expanded go-to-market team, bringing our advantages in infrastructure, data analytics, security and machine learning to more customers. And we are pleased with the momentum in our hardware business in 2017, driven by an expansion in both our product line and geographic availability. Finally, as we look further into the future for our third wave of growth, we remain excited about the longer term potential for our Other Bets businesses.
Overall, operating income was up 22% year-over-year in 2017, excluding the impact of the EC fine, although there was obviously fluctuation in the rate operating income growth quarter-to-quarter. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business. While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue will slow after the first quarter of 2018.
Within OpEx, we are keenly focused on prioritization in order to optimize the resources we’re investing for longer-term growth. As I discussed on last quarter’s call, marketing spend in the fourth quarter is significantly elevated, in particular supporting hardware but also across cloud and YouTube. For 2018, we remain excited about the investments we are making to drive the next phase of growth in our big bets in Google in cloud, hardware and YouTube, and our machine learning efforts which are powering innovation across our businesses.
You will see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount which will remain concentrated in R&D. With the closing of our deal with HTC earlier this week for example, we’ve added 2,000 employees to support our hardware business. With respect to SBC, we’ve completed the transition to a single annual compensation cycle for employees with a full year equity refresh grant to employees in the first quarter of 2018. Our biannual grant to SVPs will also occur in the first quarter and you will see the combined step up in our first quarter results. For our Other Bets in 2018, we will continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution path.
Finally, our framework for capital allocation is unchanged from our prior discussions. The primary use of cash continues to be to support organic growth in the business. We are excited about the significant opportunities we’ve identified in our businesses and continue to invest appropriately. We then layer in a sensitivity analysis regarding potential M&A as well as CapEx, in particular computing infrastructure, to support the needs of these growing businesses. The most sizable catalyst for added investment in compute power include the expanding application of machine learning efforts across Alphabet as well as additional requirements for Google’s Cloud, Search and YouTube businesses. This framework further considers complimentary uses such as the share repurchase. After taking these potential investments into account, our Board has decided to extend our share repurchase program up to an additional 8.6 billion of Class C capital stock.
In conclusion, 2017 was another great year and we are very excited about the opportunities ahead. I will now turn it over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Ruth.
Our teams are off to a great start in 2018. This year is special as it’ll mark 20 years since Google was founded. A lot has changed but our mission organizing the world’s information and making it universally accessible and useful remains the best guide for the next 10 years.
Technology is an incredibly dynamic industry. We’ve been laying a foundation for the next decade as we pivot to an AI first company, powering the next generation of Google products like the Google Assistant. And we have been making substantial investments in our three biggest bets, cloud, YouTube and hardware. These bets have enormous potential and already they are showing real momentum and gaining traction. Today, I’ll start by sharing some of the exciting progress in these three big bets.
First, Google Cloud. Google Cloud, which includes Google Cloud Platform and G Suite, has reached meaningful scale, and I’m excited to share today that it’s already $1 billion per quarter business. In fact, we believe that Google Cloud Platform, based on publicly reported data for the 12 months ending December 2017, is the fastest growing major public cloud provider in the world.
We are also increasingly doing larger, more strategic deals with customers. In fact, the number of deals worth over a $1 million across all cloud products more than tripled from 2016 to 2017. The strength of our products and the value of working with Google is increasingly clear to partners and customers.
In the fourth quarter, we forged new and deepened existing partnerships with industry leaders including Cisco for open hybrid enrollments, Salesforce for customer insights and productivity, and SAP for AI and data insights across their products. These collaborations span our entire company from engineering integration to marketing programs to joint sales, and they cover Google Cloud Platform, G Suite and Google Analytics.
We also saw accelerating customer traction on our wins [ph] included global brands like Bed Bath & Beyond, then to Dentsu Aegis Network Aegis Network, Keller Williams, Mattel and Tyco Retail Solutions. And underscoring the increasing importance of Google Cloud to the enterprise, we surpassed another new milestone, 4 million paying customers on G Suite. 
Next, YouTube. Every month more than 1.5 billion people come to YouTube to watch their favorite content on channels ranging from the Ellen Show which has more than 22 million subscribers to the NBA with over 8 million subscribers to SciShow, a really popular educational channel with more than 4.5 million subscribers. In fact, there are over 1 billion learning related video views everyday on YouTube. I learned that this week.
With all this great content, people are thinking of YouTube more as a key part of their TV viewing experience. For Tuesday night State of the Union, more partners used YouTube to live stream the address than ever before, generating 5 million live views. And just yesterday, we announced a partnership with Major League Soccer’s LA Football Club, YouTube TV will be the exclusive home to watch all locally televised English language matches in addition to their original programming and content. YouTube TV is now also available on Roku.
There is great momentum around the world with localized versions of YouTube now in 90 countries in 80 different languages. Just this morning, we announced that we are expanding the popular YouTube Go app to over 130 countries around the globe. The app has great data usage transparency and controls built in, which is especially useful for people living in regions with limited connectivity. In the fourth quarter, we also strengthened our relationship with the music industry, signing new licensing deals with Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. We also partnered with Ticketmaster to help fans by tickets to see their favorite artists perform live.
Third, our growing hardware business. Our Made by Google hardware products were very popular this holiday season. Device shipments in the fourth quarter have more than doubled year-over-year. Our retail partners also saw strong performance. Our devices are available in stores like Best Buy, Target and Walmart. I’m especially excited about the popularity of our Google devices for the home like the Google Home, Mini, Max and Chromecast. In the last year, we have sold tens of millions of these devices and counting.
I want to call out the great work of our marketing and design teams. Our hardware is beautiful individually and as a family, and people love discovering the unique features like the built-in Google Assistant. Earlier this week, we officially closed our deal with HTC, which will bring great talent to drive even more innovation in the years to come.
Turning to our efforts in machine learning. Our AI research and innovation leads the world. Our mission to better organize the world’s information has been transformed by these technologies with our Search products and the Google Assistant at the heart. There is great momentum around the Google Assistant as we bring it to more people on more devices. It’s now available on more than 400 million devices including speakers like Google Home as well as Android phones and tablets, iPhones, headphones, televisions, watches and more. People love to use the Assistant on all these devices. There was a lot of excitement around the Google Assistant at CES from partners and consumers where we brought the Assistant to new surfaces like smart displays from brands like JBL and Lenovo as well as Android Auto which is now available in more than 400 car models from brands like GM, Hyundai and Volvo.
One area that’s really benefiting from our advancements in AI is photography. The Pixel 2 phone is the leader in video rankings by industry standards, with smoother and clearer videos, thanks to machine learning and our video stabilization technique. And Google Photos continues to grow from strength to strength. On New Year’s Eve alone, over 3 billion photos and videos were uploaded to Google Photos. More broadly, we want everyone to be able to use machine learning for their own needs. We recently gave Google Cloud customers, access to AutoML which makes it far easier to build complex new enrollments. Since it launched a few weeks ago, over 10,000 customers have already signed up to try it.
Lastly, I’ll give a quick update on our computing and advertising platforms. First, Android. To provide a better, more tailored experience for our next billion users, we made Android Oreo Go edition available for our device partners. This year, we expect to see Go devices from dozens of manufacturers and with great support from mobile operators and app developers around the world. I’m confident that this will bring the power of smartphones to many more people for the first time.
Google Play is also growing well. Just last week, we introduced audiobooks, so you can now catch up on your favorite books any time on multiple devices. And in Latin America, number of unique monthly buyers on Google Play grew by over 50% year-over-year in 2017. Chromebooks also continue to gain momentum and traction. Third-party research tells us that fourth quarter sales of consumer Chromebooks in the U.S. grew by over 70% year-over-year.
Moving to our advertising platforms which help large and small businesses. As shoppers turned to their mobile phones this holiday shopping season, Google was central to helping them discover new brands, compare products and find the best deals. We redesigned the mobile shopping experience on Google, brining more product information to the forefront like reviews and ratings. We are also making the payments experience simpler, safer and more consistent. We brought our payments efforts together as a new Google Pay, which shoppers can use to pay online, in stores and across Google products like Chrome and the Play Store. Companies like Airbnb and Instacart are using Google Pay to speedup mobile checkout. And HotelTonight found that customers using Google Pay are 65% more likely to complete their bookings.
We also have really strong momentum in app promotion ads. The majority of our app promotion campaigns are now using Universal App campaigns which is part of our focus on simplifying the advertiser experience.
Additionally, we introduced a new playable ad format in Google Play that allows users to sample games before they install. Ads in Google Play are performing really well for developers. And our app promotion business on YouTube is flourishing. We launched major initiatives such as store visit measurement and location-based ad formats to drive online to offline commerce. We are focused on making sure YouTube is a great place for users and advertisers while helping creators earn money from popular content.
In addition to the significant work we are doing to product users and stop abuse on the platform, just a few weeks ago, we announced changes to advertising on YouTube, including stricter monetization criteria, new manual reviews for all videos in Google Preferred and simpler controls for marketers. The feedback we have received from advertisers and creators so far has been really positive.
So, as you can see, we are making great strides in our biggest bets, and I’m proud of the work we are doing across the Company. I’m also incredibly proud that as Google grows, we are making significant contributions to our partners, the economy and our local communities.
Our business continues to benefit our partners around the world. This includes news publishers, app developers and YouTube creators, who we share revenue with. Over the last four years, our partners have earned over $100 billion; that’s incredible and we are working on new ways to drive even more value to our partners. In the U.S. specifically, we have offices and data centers across 21 states and we plan to hire thousands of people across the U.S. this year.
Last year in the U.S., we grew faster outside the Bay Area than in the Bay Area. To support this growth, we will be making significant investments in offices across nine states including Colorado and Michigan. We will also be building or opening five big new data centers in the U.S. And with digital skills and high demand by employers, our Grow with Google initiative will have job seekers and small businesses gain education and skills to help them succeed. Just a couple of weeks ago, we announced that we are creating an IT support certification program that will give thousands of people scholarships and job opportunities. More than 10,000 people have already signed up, which is amazing.
I want to thank all our employees, Google users, partners and advertisers around the world. I couldn’t be more excited about what’s in store for all of us this year.
With that I’ll hand it back over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, coming out of CES and the success you had with Google Home and the Google Assistant during the holiday period based on the blog post you guys put out, can you identify some of the key investments in either partnerships or hardware or capabilities that you’re targeting over the next one to two years to make sure the momentum around Assistant is sustained? And then, Ruth, looking at cost of goods sold that came in quite a bit higher than we thought, and you were lapping one-time charge, if we have it right, versus the year-ago period. Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the pressures in cost of goods sold that were either seasonal or maybe a new normal in terms of higher level, going forward? Any color there would be really appreciated.
Sundar Pichai
On the Google Assistant and Google Home we are very excited about the momentum we saw in CES. It actually reflects work we’ve been doing for a while. Google Assistant in some ways brings together all the technology we’ve been building for years, and it’s an extension and it’s supported by Google Search as well.
We are also thinking about our capabilities broadly beyond just one device alone, and that’s what we are doing here across phones, across all surfaces. So, that’s something big we’re focused on. And the second is we have always built ecosystems, be it Android or Chrome or Chromebooks. We work with many, many partners and scale up things, right. And so we are leveraging those best practices and trying to build this in a way in which the entire ecosystem can ship products with the Google Assistant and generate value. So, I think the framework is great, and long-term, our investments in AI will directly manifest its capabilities for users through the Google Assistant. So, I’m very bullish on it.
Ruth Porat
And then, in terms of gross margins, it obviously reflects our product mix. And as you know well, the TAC rate for each of sites network as a percentage of revenue lines, that’s continued to increase because they’re our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic and so carry higher TAC. But, as I indicated in my opening comments, we do estimate that the year-on-year increase in the sites TAC rate will slow after the first quarter of 2018. And then, the other thing to note, other cost of revenue does reflect the seasonality of hardware, having increased both the number of products and the Made by Google family as well as continuing to expand geographically in western Europe and APAC, you can see that reflected here.
Operator
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini
Two quick questions, one for Ruth, and Sundar. I guess, Ruth, just to follow up on your comments there, the partner agreements which you just cited.. Is there any color you could give us on how these typically work? And what I mean by that is are they typically multiyear deals on average? And how do we think about these impacting the rate of change in TAC, since you are talking about the pace of growth in TAC as we look out, call it in year two if these are multiyear deals? And then, for Sundar, I guess, I wanted to follow up a little bit with what we saw at CES. But, how do you think about voice? And given the significant number of devices in the market, how do you think in the future about traffic acquisition strategies on these devices, as you look five years down the road? Is there any reason to think that the strategies might be different that you are going to follow as you look ahead, than what we’ve seen over the past, call it since the advent of the iPhone? Thank you.
Ruth Porat
So, on your first question, there is not much really that I’m going to be able to add there. I mean, given the ongoing momentum in our mobile search business, this does continue to be relevant, as you look forward, given mobile carry’s higher TAC. But, the rate, as per your question, has also reflected changes and partnership agreement. So, all factors considered, we expect the year-on-year increases will slow after the first quarter of ‘18. And as I’ve said on many of these calls, we are very pleased to have a very strong position in a rapidly growing market and that momentum does continue. I guess, the only other thing to add is that Q4 TAC as a percentage of revenue does benefit from the fact that the fourth quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube. So, quarter-on-quarter changes are less insightful because CAC is distinct from TAC. It’s not in this number but not much more to add there. Pass it to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai
And Heather on voice, we are very excited by voice. We obviously see it being adopted strongly in countries like India; it’s actually a significant part of just mobile search queries in general. And things like Google Assistant and doing Google Home kind of really accelerates the trend. But, we definitely see more multimodality. So, as you saw, we also announced many smart displays at CES. And I think that will be an exciting trend as well. So, we will bet on all of that. In general, I think about -- we want to be there for users when they need us and we want to serve everyone. This is why we work across the ecosystem, we do first party devices, we do it globally, and so, we are committed to doing that well. So, I think, it will be an extension of how we have approached search from day one and trying to serve everyone. And so, I don’t overall see a big shift.
Operator
And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas Anmuth
Some big news earlier this week just in terms of Waymo with FCA talking about delivering thousands of minivans to Waymo later in the year. So, I was hoping Ruth, you could just talk to us more about the timing for that business and how we should think about the economic model there, as you move to operations and deployment phase. And then, secondly, the cash now obviously much more accessible in terms of what is held overseas, could you just talk more about your plans there? Obviously, the bigger buyback there but still not meaningful in terms of the overall size of the company.
Ruth Porat
Sure. So, first on Waymo, we do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts, in particular the rider program in Phoenix we’re excited about and we’re expanding our testing to more states. In November, we announced that Waymo’s self-driving TAC reached a major milestone, becoming the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous. And that builds on our more than 4 million test miles driven in the real world in seven states, 25 U.S. cities, we’re currently driving, self-driving I should say, 10,000 miles every day with billions of miles in simulation and robust testing at our private facilities. So, to your question, we do continue to explore a range of options beyond the program, we’re piloting in Phoenix including ride sharing and personal use vehicles, logistics, deliveries and working with cities to help them address public transportation objectives. That being said, our first commercial application is the ride service that we will launch in 2018 that would be open to members of the public in Phoenix and riders will be able to use the Waymo app to have one of our fully driving -- self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel. So, we are very excited about that.
And then, in terms of cash, I think the main point as we think about it is there is no change in our approach to our capital allocation framework. We’ve consistently been focused on long-term investing. We talked a lot about that already on this call and our framework has been therefore very consistent. The priority, the first use is organic, it is investing in the many opportunities that we have. And the second is strategic. And we do remain active with smaller M&A deals, in particular to support our cloud business and hardware. The HTC deal which we just closed is a good example of that. Third is CapEx. So, we continue to invest in machines to support growth we see across Google but in particular supporting Cloud, Search, YouTube and all that we are doing in machine learning. And then, finally that leads to return on capital. And when we considered all of that that’s led us to extend -- have the Board extend share repurchase program which we announced a couple of years ago. And we will let you determine what that number represents in true Google fashion. But it’s just a modest increase to what we have been doing previously.
Operator
And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak
I have two. The first one, Ruth, you called out desktop search, I think the second straight quarter as being relatively strong. Could you just talk about some of the drivers of the strength in desktop? And how do you think about the sustainability of continued strong desktop growth in the 2018 and beyond? The second one kind of a question on search query volume. There is often speculation and question marks around how consumer behavior is changing in ecommerce and weather Google is still capturing as many ecommerce searches. Could you just talk to what you are seeing in retail search query volumes and search user growth within ecommerce in the United States?
Sundar Pichai
Overall, look, we -- obviously Search is very broad. And even when you talk about commercial thing, we serve across many, many categories including things like from travel to hotels and to services to products and so on. So, we are very, very comprehensive. And obviously, ecommerce is evolving a lot and we continue to invest there. Google shopping is doing well. And we work hard to make sure we bring the best experience possible, which is why I said [ph] they were also Search and Assistant we partner with companies like Walmart for example to make it much easier to buy products and so on. So, we invested a lot there. You are right, consumer behavior is changing but we are comfortable given the breadth of how we do things and how we are focused on user experience there.
Ruth Porat
And on your question on desktop, there really isn’t one particular item to call out here. And that’s why last quarter, I tried to walk through the process that our team goes through and the way they look at innovation, really stepping back and recognizing that the way we all use smartphones and desktop is continuing to evolve. So, therefore, there is utility and challenging assumptions about evolving user behavior and advertiser preferences, and that opens new lines of inquiry which benefits not just mobile but also desktop. And desktop did deliver solid revenue growth. It does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks such as planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And we are pleased with the ongoing strength. I’ll leave it to you to do any of the forecasting. But, we just view it as yet another valuable form factor and are really pleased with the performance there.
Operator
And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore.
Anthony DiClemente
Thanks for taking my questions. One for Sundar and for Ruth. Sundar, on YouTube, you mentioned that 1.5 billion people come to YouTube. Any other information you can give us there on user growth or engagement trends would be great, anything on time spent, I mean particularly as YouTube becomes more mature and mobile video particularly in North America gets more competitive. And then, also on YouTube, anything around new products or features driving the monetization or ad business? And then, Ruth, just a question on the growth in marketing spend in the fourth quarter. I think you said that the 4Q was significantly elevated. Should we interpret that to mean that the growth rate in selling and marketing year-over-year should decelerate off the 4Q? And then, just related to that, you’re getting a good return on investment from this marketing spend, particularly when you think about media mix and all the spend that we’ve seen on TV as compared to digital marketing?
Sundar Pichai
Look, on YouTube, we are continuing to see great momentum. Maybe one area which for example highlights how well it’s doing is if you think about YouTube on TV, people actually want watching YouTube on the big screen, our growth has been significant there. And so, increasingly people use YouTube for -- we see it being used to across every possible use case. And I said it earlier in the call. Every day, we get over a 1 billion user on educational content alone. People use it to go, catch upon sports, music, entertainment. And so, you can think about the breadth of -- historically, YouTube has been very strong on mobile and continues to strong on mobile. It’s doing particularly well in the next billion user markets. Our growth last year was very strong there, which is why we supported it with investments like YouTube Go. And we are seeing it now grow well-beyond mobile, especially in the leaving room. So, a lot of momentum there.
Ruth Porat
And then, in terms of sales and marketing, as I said, it particularly supported hardware but was also supporting Cloud and YouTube. And as both, Sundar and I’ve said, these are important Google growth areas for us and we are investing to support growth in the business. The elevated levels this quarter did reflect both seasonality and strategic decision to invest in these brands. And so, view it as a very important part of the overall investment and what we view as very sizeable opportunities. And it’s both supporting the brand and the momentum therefore going into 2018, but this is very specific product focus as well.
Operator
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Daniel Salmon
Sundar, I’ll go with the European theme. First, curious to hear your thoughts on the potential impact of GDPR, maybe both on your own sites and properties and how any business practices may need to be adjusted for that but also for tools like customer match that you are advertisers may use. And then, second, I’ll take a shot at it. Any updates on your dialogue with the EU officials and regulators on the proceeding there?
Sundar Pichai
Good question. I was just in Europe last week, it was exciting to be there. There is clearly momentum we feel in terms of how Europe is doing. And we are very committed to the region. We are opening new offices there. We announced AI center. We are committed to hiring more engineers and supporting staff there. So, it’s an important market for us.
On things like GDPR, we want to be -- we have been thoughtfully engaged there. I think it’s important to put privacy first for European citizens, and we are very supportive of the work that’s underway there. And we are committed to complying with GDPR across all the services that we provide in Europe. There is still time. As a reminder, it doesn’t go into effect until May or so. And we are working to make sure all our products are ready. And we will work hard to make the transition well. In terms of -- again, with the European Commission, we have long had constructive conversations. We are understanding their concerns and responding with thoughtful changes, and we will continue engaging in a thoughtful way.
Operator
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
Colin Sebastian
First, Sundar, your comments on Google Cloud were upbeat. And I wonder how much of the momentum there is related to machine learning capabilities offered as service. If you could frame just how important that is for the cloud business overall? And then, as a follow-up on Google Home or the voice-based assistant. If there is any update in how you are thinking about monetization from a transactional perspective, transactional model with perhaps retail partners or do you see an ad-based model emerging there as well?
Sundar Pichai
On the first thing calling on cloud, particularly last quarter, we obviously brought AutoML to our Google Cloud customers. To me that shows the rate at which we are bringing our internal advances. It’s just a year ago, I remember reviewing with the team and they first showed me the AutoML work, we spoke about it at Google I/O, and it’s pretty cutting edge work. And to turn it back around and to provide it for everyone in the world, I think that shows the power of what we can do with Google Cloud and get our state-of-the-art and get it to everyone.
I think the momentum there obviously is due to our strength in machine learning, the kind of open agile development environment we provide security, and then the combination with G Suite. But above all, I think what -- we’ve always -- we’ve been doing cloud now for 19 years because Google itself was built on a cloud platform. But where the momentum is really coming from is over the past two years, we’ve put a lot of effort to make sure we are enterprise scale ready. So, now we can handle any type of enterprise, any kind of regulatory complexity, security complexity and so on. And that’s evident in the business wins we are seeing. So, we are signing customers who are very large across-the-board, globally. And I think that’s driving a lot of momentum there.
On your question on Google Home and voice-based assistant and how we are thinking about monetization. There are a lot of interesting ideas internally. So, teams are excited about trying new things. We see a lot of potential. But the guidance I’ve given the teams is to be squarely focused on user experience. We are really getting started. I think these are going to be powerful technologies. But, there are areas where we clearly feel all of us fall short for doing right by users and getting their expectations -- matching their expectation. So, you’ll see us focused on user experience there for a while to come.
Operator
And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
Michael Nathanson
One for Sundar and one for Ruth, both on YouTube. So, first question was as Google Preferred kicks up a little heat on types of qualities that makes the cut for your videos. Do you feel you have to take a more active stance and looking at what is in Google Preferred -- sorry YouTube Preferred and how are you going to go about that? And then for Ruth, the past year was one where we heard a lot about brand safety. And I wonder when you look back at the YouTube results in 2017, is there any noticeable signs of maybe a shift in ad spending from some of the brands who were making those complaints? So, those are my questions.
Sundar Pichai
I probably can talk about both as they’re related. We obviously want to make sure YouTube has a great experience for users, content creators and advertisers because it supports content creators. And we took a lot of steps last year but particularly in December we adopted a new rigorous approach. And that’s a much more stringent standard for creators. For example, they need 1,000 subscribers to be eligible for monetization. We are manually reviewing Google Preferred videos. We obviously use machine learning to support that a lot and they both go hand in hand. We have provided improved controls for marketers and we are also working with trusted third party vendors to assist brand suitability. So, it’s a comprehensive approach to make sure all of this works well. And so, while there have been concerns but we are working really hard to address them and respond strongly. And so, I think we’re focused on the long-term opportunity here and I think we are setting ourselves up well for the years ahead.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ken Sena of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Ken Sena
So, just a question, searches seem to be coming more qualified through travel as far as filtering the price that people want to pay, locations, amenities et cetera. Is there any trend that goes along with that in terms of maybe depressing search volume growth to some extent because of the more filtered aspect? And then, secondly, does the higher qualification trend tie in at all to the shifts towards programmatic and in terms of other parties that might be involved or the discussion that we had around TAC? And then, maybe two, just as a follow-up, if you can provide just a little bit more color on Google Pay in terms of what might be different in this round versus previous attempts?
Sundar Pichai
Maybe I’m not fully sure I understood all the specifics there. But, at a high level, as people are on the go, they are travelling et cetera, if anything, I think search is more invaluable than ever before. All the work we do in local searches applies incredibly when you travel, the properties we have like Google Maps et cetera, go along with it. So, overall, I think they all add up to a better user experience and hence a better opportunity for us. Google Pay turns out to be an important part of all of this. As we move from just answers to helping users complete actions about time including transactions, the ability to complete the transaction is an important part of it and which is why making sure Google Pay in a unified way works as seamlessly as possible is a big part of our long-term strategy.
Operator
The next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Stephen Ju
So, Sundar, I think Ruth cited hardware in the prepared remarks as the largest contributor in the fourth quarter for the other revenue line. As you look at the roadmap going forward, you acquired the HTC engineers to bring that team in-house. So, looks like for the first time you have an integrated hardware and software team under one roof. So, how do you think your product development pace and strategy will change for smartphones and other devices going forward? And also, does it make sense to bring the Nest team to be more integrated into core Google as well given the drive to increase the touch points for all the Google products to other form factors?
Sundar Pichai
You are right that part of the reason we are so excited about being able to bring this world-class team in-house is while we have been working together already, we have had to straddle a company boundary to do that. But now, having them as Googlers, will really make that integrated development, which is so critical for us to do it better. We bring a unique approach to hardware, the combination of AI plus software plus hardware. So, being able to get those teams working together, I think would really drive the pace forward. And the best example of that is you see the advances we have made with both still and video photography on our phones. And the Nest team is very, very closely aligned with the Google hardware team. They work hard to realize a lot of synergies there. We already shared a lot of our go-to-market efforts. And we increasingly are collaborating on product development as well. So, we collaborate closely, and I’m excited at the possibilities there as well.
Operator
And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post
First for Sundar, it didn’t feel like there is many visible search changes this year as far as coverage or ad formats? So, I would love to hear your thoughts on search innovation pipeline as you look at the 2018 and key growth drivers going forward? And then, Ruth, in the prepared remarks, there was a lot of comments on investment in your medium-term business growth drivers, offices, data centers and other areas. And I’m just wondering if you view 2018 upcoming as an investment year or kind of more of the same of what we have seen over the last couple of years?
Sundar Pichai
Justin, when you think about Search, one of the ways I’d encourage you to think, we think about user journeys. So, a lot of the innovation that we are doing has gone on to not just an individual query and how we respond but how we think about what our user is trying to accomplish over a series of successions. Are you trying to plan a trip and how do we do it better; do you have a health-related area where you are trying to learn more about it, and how do we help you through that. And so, it’s not always just changing a specific format but understanding context better and bringing you that information through a journey. And I think so, there is a lot of innovation that’s happening in that direction. And also underlying is what I said earlier, it’s not just providing the answers, how do you help them get to that information and act on it. And so, maybe you found something and you want to call, call that place or maybe you are trying to order a birthday gift and we actually want you to -- want to go a step further and help that -- help you buy that gift. So, that’s along the lines. And the innovation is happening across search and assistant in integrated way.
Ruth Porat
And then, in terms of your investment question, we’ve consistently been investing across Alphabet and we have tried to be very clear about our investment priorities, all with a view to supporting healthy, long-term growth that goes back to the inception of the Company. Year-on-year op inc growth that you have seen does include these sustained investments for all the areas that both, Sundar and I have talked about, for the year up 22% versus last year. Obviously a lot of variability in growth quarter-to-quarter. And that we just continue to be focused on doing the right things to support growth of the business. The fourth quarter does reflect the obvious seasonality. And again, we continue to look across various, their needs and try and prioritize that we can remain committed to long-term growth.

Our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. 
Ben Schachter
Just a couple of questions. Can you discuss the evolution of the business model for Waymo? You are launching the ride hailing service in Phoenix, you’ve worked with manufacturers. You talked about other models. But, when you think about the sort of 5 to 10-year view of that, what will the primary business model look like? And separately, can you talk about what is interesting from a strategic point of view about the video game business? You are making some key hires there and just wondering what you think Google can bring to that industry that would be innovative.
Ruth Porat
So, on Waymo, really not much more to add. We’re really pleased after years of work on technology where it was really about safety, safety, safety and developing the technology and the platform. And now we are in a position where we have this opportunity to let people use and benefit from what we’ve developed. So, I think that safety has been a key driver and the opportunity for cities has been really exciting what it means about optimizing resource base that they have. So, it’s still very early days and we’re just -- we’re pleased with all the progress the team’s made. But, it would be getting out of ourselves to go further out than what we’ve laid out here.
Sundar Pichai
On the video gaming side, I think, look, we are -- maybe today have a lot of momentum in these areas, both with YouTube as a platform, Google play. So, these are assets that really worked well, and we will continue investing there. Nothing new or interesting to share with you at this time.

And now, I'll hand the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Ellen. We had a terrific quarter. Revenues of 27.8 billion were up 24% year-on-year, and also up 24% in constant currency. Advertising revenues benefited from strong performance in sites, which was powered by tremendous results in mobile search. Healthy growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. We also benefited from substantial growth in other revenues from cloud, play and hardware.
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll view the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. Next, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $27.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. We realized a positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $255 million or $64 million after the impact of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year-over-year.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography; performance was strong in all regions. U.S. revenues were $12.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $9.1 billion, up 23% year-over-year in both reported and fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $4.2 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 31% in fixed FX terms. Other Americas revenues were $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 32% in fixed FX terms.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $11.1 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.6 billion, up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. Specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and hardware-related costs.
Operating expenses were $8.8 billion, up 11% year-over-year. The year-on-year expense growth in part reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year. As discussed previously, this change in SBC grant timing affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017, with elevated year-on-year expense growth in the first half of the year, but benefits the year-on-year comparisons for Q3 and Q4.
Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 78,101, up 2,495 people from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count additions were once again made in cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business.
Operating income was $7.8 billion, up 35% versus last year, and the operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was $197 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 15.6% for the third quarter. Net income was $6.7 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.57.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $3.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.9 billion with free cash flow of $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $100.1 billion, of which approximately $60.5 billion or 60% is held overseas.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $27.5 billion, up 23% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
Network revenues were $4.3 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $3.4 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by cloud, play and hardware. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.5 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 32% year-over-year. The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.
Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year. Operating income including the impact of SBC was $8.7 billion, up 29% versus last year and the operating margin was 32%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the third quarter, Other Bets revenues were $302 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss including the impact of SBC was $812 million for the third quarter.
Other Bets accrued CapEx was $77 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber, due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q 2016. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets.
A couple of updates; Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat. Nest also announced a home security solution that includes the Nest Secure alarm system, Nest Hello video doorbell, the Nest Cam IQ outdoor security camera and corresponding software and services.
Waymo continues to expand its geographic presence and announced this morning that it will commence winter testing in Michigan to build on our progress to-date addressing the challenge of autonomous driving in cold weather, particularly with snow, sleet and ice. Michigan is the sixth state where Waymo is testing its self-driving vehicles. Over the last eight years, Waymo's cars have self-driven in more than 20 cities.
With Loon, we were pleased to announce just last week that the team is collaborating with AT&T to deliver emergency Internet service to the hardest hit parts of Puerto Rico.
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, in terms of revenues, results this quarter again reflect our relentless focus on innovation, which is growing our advertising revenues. I frequently highlight our culture of innovation.
In that regard, the most important point is that we are data driven with an extraordinary team of engineers, product managers and designers, who constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences. This approach enables us to find new opportunities given that the way consumers seek information continues to evolve. Our teams work relentlessly to anticipate and adapt to the expanding capabilities of both software and hardware.
Further, our culture of innovation is building our non-advertising revenue streams in cloud, play and hardware. Earlier this month, for example, we launched our expanded line of hardware products, bringing the best AI software and hardware together and building on the first generation of Made by Google products we introduced last year. Longer-term, we remain excited about the opportunities in our Other Bets with ongoing progress.
Second, with respect to profitability, we continue to remain focused on long-term dollar growth versus margins. Pressure in our total cost of revenues reflects our product mix shift with a number of our higher growth businesses also carrying higher cost of revenues. In our advertising businesses, TAC continues to increase as our highest growth areas, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
We expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue. As we've frequently stated, we remain focused on profit dollar growth, and these areas are additive to our growth.
The other cost of revenues associated with our non-advertising businesses is also affected by product mix. In the fourth quarter in particular, the impact of our growing hardware line will be more accentuated given the early stage of this business and holiday seasonality.
On operating expenses, we remain committed to investing to support our growing product areas. The more modest OpEx growth in Q3 reflects both the timing of stock-based compensation and the timing of sales and marketing spend, with the reality that not all investments fall neatly into a single calendar quarter.
In particular, we're committed to sales and marketing investments in Q4 for the important holiday season. The most significant uptick in marketing will be to support our new expanded hardware line, which was just announced at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In addition, we are investing to support YouTube and our other platforms.
Third, as to CapEx, we continue to invest to support business momentum, including increased compute power from machine learning, which is an asset across Alphabet as well as to support cloud, search and YouTube growth.
In conclusion, a great quarter. Thank you. And let me now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Ruth. We had another great quarter. I've been really proud of the progress this quarter, launching popular new products and continuing to grow our business in new areas. It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for a billion people a day.
Even though we are in the early days of AI, we are already rethinking how to build products around machine learning. It's a new paradigm compared to mobile-first software, and I'm thrilled how Google is leading the way.
Consumers can already experience how AI allows them to interact with computing more naturally than ever before. Computers are adapting to people rather than people needing to adapt to computers.
Fundamental to this experience is Google Search and our Assistant. We introduced Assistant last year and it continues to get better every day, helping people get things done in the real world. Walmart and Target have recently integrated with Google Home, which means you can order everyday items from them much more easily.
500 million people now use the machine learning smarts of Google Photos to manage and share their memories. That billion plus people using Google Maps now get thoughtfully contextual information like how to find parking where they are going. And businesses are seeing how AI can help them grow.
Our open-source software, TensorFlow, is allowing anyone to use machine learning to solve problems even in industries like agriculture. Researches recently use TensorFlow to make smartphones able to identify disease in cassava plants, a major food source in the developing world.
We made TensorFlow open-source and free because we fundamentally believe in creating computing platforms that developers can customize and build on. I'm really pleased with the way our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome, have continued to grow, enabling great experiences for people all over the world and powering devices for more than 1,000 brands worldwide.
This quarter, we released the latest operating system, Android 8.0, and released a preview of ARCore, which brings augmented reality to existing Android phones. Last week, we announced a partnership with Samsung to bring ARCore to all Galaxy devices.
Even though it's been an incredible busy few years and technology is moving rapidly, at our core, we remain an information company. Our mission to provide useful information to people in every corner of the world is unchanged. We care deeply about the quality of information we provide and constantly work to get this right. As technology evolves, we have to evolve with it to ensure quality information can flourish.
Our teams are making a big effort to support journalists and other people who produce high-quality information around the world. We are supporting publishers as they decide the right approach to free articles and subscription content. We are moving away from first click free to a more flexible model of content sampling. And we are working with publishers to build a frictionless payment solutions for subscriptions that can help them grow revenues and find new readers.
As new threats arise, we are committed to protecting journalists and media organizations from hacking and denial-of-service attacks. For example, we just launched the advanced production program for Google accounts, which is designed to protect the accounts of those most at risk of targeted attacks, including journalists and other public figures. To wrap up my overview, I'm thrilled with how Google is solving big problems and making products that billions of people use every day.
Now let's review our three big bets, starting with YouTube. YouTube continues to see phenomenal growth as the premier global destination where people go to watch video. Three of the key areas we are focused on are; strengthening the existing community, continuing to drive growth and expanding our subscriptions business.
On the community side, we are helping create meaningfully interactions that bring creators and fans closer together. This quarter, we launched a new feature that lets viewers share videos directly in the app. So the minute you see a video from a creator you love, you can share the fun with friends and family. We're also seeing significant growth in other areas.
As I mentioned in the last earnings call, YouTube now has over 1.5 billion users. On average, these users spend 60 minutes a day on mobile. But this growth isn't just happening on desktop and mobile. YouTube now gets over 100 million hours of watch time in the living room every day, and that's up 70% in the past year alone.
We are continuing to invest in new subscription based monetization models. YouTube Red, our first foray into the subscription market, is on track to release over 40 original shows this year and YouTube TV, our live TV subscription service, continues to expand into new markets. It now covers two-thirds of U.S. households and is available in 15 metro areas.
Now on to Google Cloud; we continue to make progress winning over enterprise customers. Customers tell us they are switching to Google Cloud Platform because of our prowess in data analytics and machine learning, our commitment to being an open platform with tools like Kubernetes, which runs in both cloud and hybrid environments and our leadership in security.
Just yesterday we announced a new partnership at Cisco. We are collaborating on an open solution that gives customers an easy approach to the cloud, enabling them to run apps that span both on-prem environments and Google Cloud Platform. G Suites, our collaboration and productivity applications are leading the industry. We have made improvements to drive, docs and Gmail launching new features to help teams work better together.
Nielsen recently moved to G Suite and said it's a great productivity and collaboration tool for their modern workforce. All of these things are driving momentum with customers and partners. Companies like Kohls, PayPal, Rolls-Royce Marine in Europe and popular messaging app, Hike in India, moved to Google Cloud. We also announced a new partnership with Marketo and expanded our relationship with Pivotal and VMware. To support our growing global customer base, we introduced two new regions in the quarter in São Paulo and Frankfurt and continue to grow our go-to-market team.
Next, our hardware business. Earlier this month, we launched our second-generation family of Made by Google hardware products built with AI at the core. Last year, we focused on building the foundation to launch a line of devices Made by Google. This year, we are focused on bringing together the best AI software and hardware to give people a great user experience.
For example, the new Google Home Max is a smart speaker powered by the Assistant. It has AI-based smart sound, which adapts the audio experience to the user's environment context and preferences.
The new Pixel 2 has the world's best smartphone camera and a useful feature where you can summon the Google Assistant by just squeezing the phone. To get these devices in people's hands, we are also focused on scaling our go-to-market strategy. We are investing more in marketing. We're launching in more countries and we are offering these devices in more retailers, and we are already seeing results. Pre-orders of Pixel on day one this year were more than double what they were last.
Also this quarter, we signed a deal with HTC in Taiwan that will help accelerate our hardware business by bringing on a team of talented engineers. This deal lays the foundation for our continued efforts next year. And our advertising platforms continue to drive great results for our partners. While mobile has given rise to an unprecedented amount of data and complexity for advertisers, we think that machine learning will help it make – will help make it easier for advertisers to reach consumers. But even as we give advertisers incredible scale and reach across our ad platforms, we know consumer attention is scarce. That's why we are pleased YouTube ads continue to deliver the highest viewability rates in the industry.
YouTube now has a 95% ad viewability rate, which is significantly higher than the average 66% viewability rate of other video ads. We continue to see the industry shift to six second bumper ads and so greater adoption this quarter from brands like Bear, Ben & Jerry's, Louis Vuitton and Volvo. And Google continues to be the platform of choice to help small business owners get online and grow their business.
On our last earnings call, I mentioned a free website builder for small businesses. During the quarter, more than 1 million small businesses used it to build up websites, helping many of them get online for the first time. We also introduced local post, which allows small business owners to easily post their latest updates like upcoming events, special offers and new arrivals, right on Google Search in Maps.
Our commitment to both large and small advertisers shows how we build products that all businesses can succeed in. That mission also has a geographical dimension, and I wanted to say a word about the momentum we are seeing in Asia.
Our revenues are up significantly in the region, driven by great results we are driving for existing and new advertisers. That holds true across developed markets like Japan and emerging markets like the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which have seen the number of active advertisers grow by 25% or more in the past 12 months. And this growth is bringing tremendous benefits to our partners there.
In the past three years, we have paid out more than $24 billion to our publisher, creator and app developer partners in Asia Pacific. And to help millions of people, we are building products specifically designed for local markets in Asia.
In India last month, we launched Tez, a mobile payments and commerce app that already has more than 7.5 million users who have made more than 30 million transactions. I'm really excited about the potential this brings for India's mostly cash-based economy.
As I said at the start, it's been a great quarter for Google. Just two weeks ago, I was in Pittsburgh launching our new Grow with Google initiative, which provides digital skills to millions of people and economic opportunity to countless businesses. It was amazing to see firsthand the transformative impact that information is having in schools, in the workplace and for local business.
As I said then, I remain a technology optimist, not only because I believe in technology, but because I believe in people. I want to thank all the Googlers who continue to work so hard to advance our mission and to help people everywhere. Thank you.
Ellen West - Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. One, we've seen a lot of partnership announcements intra-quarter on the e-commerce side with Google Express and voice assisted shopping on Google Home. Wanted to understand better your ambitions in e-commerce as a marketplace or a platform and how that might also feed back into the advertising business?
Second question would be about the cash on the balance sheet and sort of how philosophically you think about deploying that cash against either shareholder returns or some of the big opportunities you laid out today? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Maybe I'll take the first question and give it to Ruth on the cash question. We are very excited about the partnerships we are getting here with large retailers, and we are seeing traction globally. We've obviously partnered with them through our advertising products.
But with shopping, especially as we move on to making shopping more seamless across mobile and newer computing categories like Google Home, I think there's tremendous interest here.
So we are just getting started. And I think you will see us make a lot more progress and have a lot more announcements. And I think we are going to be relentlessly focused on making the buying experience much more seamless for users. So there's a lot more to come.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
So in terms of your second question. There was really no change from the approach we've talked about previously as we think about capital allocation. The priority is organic, as you said in your question. We have a host of really exciting opportunities and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains number one.
The second is strategic, continuing to add on where it makes sense. We're pleased to have added on HTC this quarter. Acquisitions have obviously been an important part of our history. And then the third is the return of capital and no change or update there in terms of how we think about that.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great, thanks. Two questions, please. Sundar, you talked about APAC. You called out Asia. And we noticed that too, that that year-over-year growth rate was higher than – it was the highest, at least since you've been disclosing that. And you provided some of whats, but any whys behind why that growth is accelerating? Is that something that has just naturally reached the tipping point? Is there something different that Alphabet/Google has done in Asia to accelerate that growth?
And then, Ruth, can I ask you. You talked about the factors driving TAC and you mentioned changes in partner agreements. Is there any way you could give us any more color? Did you just renew some major partner agreements and there's nothing of that magnitude into next year? Or should we just assume that this is just part of operations, there was nothing major recent, you could have major ones coming up? Just something to help us qualify – I don't you think you'd used that language before – what that indicated? Thanks a lot.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
The Asia question, largely, I think we've been laying a foundation for a very, very long time. Our products are very heavily used there. And so we've worked hard to build a user base and then the mobile transformation is a secular shift there. That's definitely driving accelerated growth. And it creates a virtuous cycle. We see new advertisers coming on.
We are investing more in Asia as well in addition to our go-to-market teams. We are building out great product and engineering teams. That's what has led us to improve core products like Search, Maps, YouTube, et cetera, to work better in those regions. And also launched region-specific products like Google Tez in India. So I think, overall, that's creating a good virtuous cycle and I'm looking forward to having more momentum there.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And on your TAC question, as I indicated in the opening comments. There are a couple of drivers here. One is changes in partner agreements. And I think the main point is we're very pleased with our strong partnerships across the mobile ecosystem. And the other was the ongoing shift to mobile, which we've talked about a lot and the fact that it carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.
I think the most important point is that what you're seeing is we have a very healthy mobile business, search business and it is growing substantially and our focus remains on long-term revenue and profit dollar growth.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I had two. First, Ruth, you talked about the ongoing advertising innovation, and it's pretty clear that that's happening in mobile, which seems like it probably accelerated in the quarter. So I was hoping if you could comment on that. But then also, how do you think about where you are in terms of optimization on mobile relative to desktop? And then just second on YouTube. I was hoping you could comment on the extent to which you're seeing marketers return to the platform post the brand safety issues of 2Q and for a few of those who may not be back on yet, what are they looking for to fully return? Thanks.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
So it felt like a number of calls talked about the fact that there was no one item that was driving the momentum we saw in our sites revenue, and that was the point of giving you a bit more color here. We are really pleased with the momentum in the business, excited about the opportunities we have given the ongoing strong underlying secular trend, but wanted to give you more color on what do we mean by a culture of innovation, and that's really why I tried to get into a bit more about the rigor of the process.
And one of the key points is that we do have the opportunity, and we anchor this indeed, that we're constantly challenging assumptions. We're running a lot of experiments to enhance user and advertiser experience. And the approach continues to be productive, especially because the line of inquiry evolves as user behavior evolves. And so what users wanted in the earlier days of smartphones when screens were smaller is obviously, very different from expectations users have today. Each quarter, the ads team introduces more than 100 enhancements out of a much larger pool of assumptions that they've tested. Machine learning is at the center of our processes and systems. And we do remain excited about the potential.
Desktop, I commented on. We are pleased with the ongoing strength of the business. It delivered solid revenue growth that remains an important form factor for certain more complex tasks. We've talked about that in prior quarters. Things like planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And so I think with the strength here underscores the importance of desktop for many users in many task, notwithstanding, the growing utility of mobile for users.
And then in terms of YouTube, I think you asked it. Well, we've been doing a lot to protect the ecosystems and do the right things for advertisers and users and content creators and the overwhelming majority of advertisers never left and those who did, many are already back on the platform.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you, Ruth.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Thank you so much. Sundar, I was wondering if you could share with us your thoughts on voice search. And I guess, in particular, how do you think about maintaining Google fleet as the way we search changes, and as we see increasing adoption of these voice-enabled digital assistance in the home? And part of it, I guess, I'm also wondering about is how do you think about your relationships with the partners? And if the device base broadens out, does your leverage with the partners change? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
It's a good question, Heather. Voice, it's important to remember, voice is one input. When you look at how customers interact, they obviously are interacting more and more naturally, seamlessly across a set of screens, computing works and context for them. And even then when they asked voice queries, the response always what they need is not voice alone. Think about walking into a store and if you could only ask using voice and the person has to reply in voice what all is in the store. So that model applies.
So we expect a lot of continual experiences across screens, across modalities. So it's a big opportunity. I think it's opening up newer ways in which we are working with partners. I spoke earlier about the kind of experiences we are now able to drive at Walmart and Target, which we could have done a year before. Thanks to voice, how we are using it in the Google Assistant and how we are driving these partnerships.
So there's a lot of excitement about how we can do all of this differently. So we are using this as a good way to rethink everything we are doing with the caveat that voice still, overall, is an emerging category compared to how users use our products. So there's a lot of room ahead.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey, I like to – maybe discuss a couple of your growth businesses. First, on cloud. Maybe you could talk about some of the wins you're seeing and why people are necessarily choosing Google and the momentum there?
And then, secondly, on the hardware business. It feels a little confusing on what your real goal is there. Is that to build a real independent separate hardware business? And how the Android relationships are going around that? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
First on cloud. Effectively, we are seeing strong momentum. And we already hear from customers that we have outstanding technology. So the reason we win deals in many cases is because we have superior technology and people also see the room ahead, thanks to a lead in machine learning. And that's an area where I think we'll continue to drive advantage. The main area where we need to get better is to scale our go-to-market and be in more places to effectively get more customers. And we are doing that a few different ways, Diane and team have really skilled our global sales force. But more importantly, I think we are striking a lot of important partnerships with leading technology vendors to scale and reach more customers.
And so be the partnership at Cisco that we announced or, in this quarter, we also teamed up with Pivotal and VMware. And earlier the year, you saw us partner with SAP. And all of this help customers more easily run their apps, both on-prem and in the cloud. And we are doing this all in a open way with Kubernetes. So that's the overall strategy, and I think that's really beginning to pay off. And you will see us scale across all these dimensions for cloud in the year ahead.
In terms of hardware, we are very seriously committed to making hardware. Few reasons. Hardware is – the intersection of hardware and software is how you drive computing forward. And historically, hardware has been maybe a single device business. For a long while, it was PCs then maybe plus smartphones. But you're clearly entering an era where you going to have different types of computing experiences. And so to do that and to stitch it all together across, I think it's important we thoughtfully put our opinion forward. We're equally committed to working with the ecosystems and we provide the same basis on both sides, be it Android or Chrome. And it's going really well.
Our close partnership this quarter across a set of Android partners. You see great momentum at the recently launched Samsung Note 8. We announced ARCore on Samsung devices. So we have strong momentum there as well. So we're committed to pushing forward hard on all these areas.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. I had a question for either Sundar or Ruth. It's just a philosophical question on TAC. So as the mobile search market matures, particularly in the Western markets, the question is, why does Google feel like it needs to pay any TAC to partners at all? Is the lesson learned from the Firefox, desktop partner loss a couple of years ago was that you didn't lose any revenue and you stopped paying TAC on that agreement, why wouldn't the same logic apply to mobile search? If not now, at some point in the future?
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Look, I mean, first of all, we have a lot of experience in this area. We've been doing distribution deals for our search for well over a decade and I personally been involved all the way from the toolbar in the Chrome days. So by now, first of all, we want to construct a win-win construct. So we always want to construct in which we do better when our partners to better. And so doing TAC well aligns us in that way and, historically, it has driven a lot of growth. And so it's a model we understand. We understand the key economics behind it. And so we are very thoughtful about how we drive it forward. So we are driving it forward in a way in which we know it's going to give strong both revenue and earnings growth. And so I think we are pretty comfortable with how we are approaching it and so we'll continue to do that.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just the first one, a little bit on growing Alphabet's multi-app ecosystem. Sundar, how do you think about the strategic importance to drive Chrome and Google Assistant app installs and user growth on non-Android mobile platforms? Maybe talk about how you evaluate, how you're doing there so far?
And then bigger picture. You've made large and exciting investment in growth opportunities across Google and Other Bets. I'd be curious to hear philosophically, how do you evaluate these opportunities and talk about some of the ROI thought processes or evaluation you make when making large capital allocation decisions?
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
So, on the first one. One of the unique things about how we approach product development is we've always, at Google, care about building our products for everyone. And be it Search or Gmail or Google Photos or Chrome, we work hard to drive it across all platforms.
Obviously, some products, their ability to make it work well on other platforms versus our native platforms, there are differences and so we understand that. It's partly why we are very committed to driving success on our platforms, both through the ecosystem and our hardware efforts as well.
So we think about it holistically. But you'll continue to see us put a lot of effort into other platforms as well. For example, over the past couple of years, I think we've meaningfully improved our products on iOS, as an example.
On the other part, maybe Ruth, do you want to give color. I would just say, at a high level, we drive our investments because we think about it from a user perspective first. We see areas where there are clear user problems and we think about whether we can use computer science and our technology advantage as Google and Alphabet to give a differentiated offering for users. And we do that and then we think long-term. But that's how we do about it. Maybe Ruth can give more color there, too.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And then the numbers flow out of that, which is we look over a multi-year period. A lot of the things that we're doing are multi-year investments, and that's why we stress repeatedly that we're looking at what are the long-term needs and opportunities that we could be addressing, if we're doing that well, we're delivering long-term revenue and earnings growth. And those investments need to be seeded early for them to continue to grow and flourish around the globe. Whether that responds to the first question on what's going on in APAC or across Alphabet more broadly, we take a multi-year look. We look at the business, technical, financial milestones along the way, and we allocate resources in order to make sure we're maximizing the long-term potential to deliver as we see is appropriate.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC
Thank you. I have two for Sundar, one on HTC. It's kind of interesting thing that you didn't buy the company, but you bought talent. And I wonder, what does that move directly give you? And what did you think was lacking, I guess, from the product side before you made that move? Then I had one on YouTube.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On HTC, as we were working on our hardware efforts, we've been working with HTC very closely on the Pixel phones. So across the two companies, we saw a win-win construct, by which we could bring the team and the IP and other assets related to the Pixel business in-house. And it also allows HTC to focus better on their phones and the other products they're working on.
So it just made a lot of sense to do it. And I would also think about the overall capability we are getting, not just to make phones, but as we get into other product categories, like Google Home, VR and so on, right? And so it's important to continue to build that out. And the talent we saw there is definitely best-in-class.
Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC
Okay. And then on DIRECTV – sorry, YouTube TV. It's clear that you guys have pretty good momentum, 50 markets already. I wonder, what has surprised you about the early consumer engagements? Anything you could share about early findings on the rollout of YouTube TV?
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Yeah, main thing I would say is the consumer feedback, I think there's always been this promise on being able to, just like today on Google Search when you want something, we make it so easy for you to find it. Bringing that kind of a seamless experience on to TV, when you think about something you want to watch, making it seamless. And so, improving that process, I think, is really what people positively comment on.
Other things are being able to personalize it, bringing our machine learning-based recommendations over time. So that's how people notice. They get content, in which they are interested in, surfaced much better. So I think given where we are, I'm really excited at the initial reception. And we are gathering a lot of feedback, bringing it to more markets, and I'm going to work hard at making the product better.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I'd like to just follow-up on an earlier question about e-commerce and specifically, a trend we see growing across the ecosystem of applying e-commerce data to targeting advertising. Maybe if you could describe how you view that at a high level and whether that's important to you, and growing that opportunity across all of your platforms. And perhaps, shed some light on areas where you may be able to tap into that. You discussed partnerships with retailers, Android Pay. You're tracking off-line conversions more, even a product like Customer Match would seem like it'd be an opportunity to have your advertisers bring that type of data to the table. Would love to hear a little bit more about your thoughts on that?
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
It's a good question, Dan. You kind of partially answered it. So you're welcome to come and work on our e-commerce team anytime. To us, as a vertical, we see huge opportunities there. There's a lot of flywheel effects we see. Almost all e-commerce providers are really interested in, like, cloud for obvious reasons. So we see tremendous traction by which we are – we can talk to them about cloud. They're already advertising partners. They're beginning to work with us much more closely on driving a seamless shopping experience. We're working on payments. And so, it creates a nice flywheel effect, and we can do this globally across all the countries we do it in. And so, we are treating it more thoughtfully and investing in addressing the vertical opportunity we see in front of us, and we'll continue working on that.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Great. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of follow-ups. First on TAC, wondering if changes in partner agreements, since those are one of the key drivers of the increase in TAC, could we then see the rate of TAC growth moderate as you anniversary those deals?
And then, secondly, as it relates to voice and visual search inputs, I know it's still early for Google Lens. But overall, I'm wondering what portion of those search queries are proving to be incremental to search, the search experience, or are they largely substituting for searches on screens? Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
So in terms of TAC, as I indicated, we've got a couple of things going on. We're pleased with our strong partnerships. We continue to stress the impact from the shift to mobile. And again, both Sundar and I have said it, our focus remains on the profit dollar growth. And we've got a really nice position and a strong growth area. So that's what you're seeing here. But as I also said, we do expect it to increase some from here. And you've got a couple of factors going on.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On the second thing, look, I think based on every metric we see users' information needs are only going up. And the amount of information they deal with are increasing. And as we add new modalities, it really drives a better experience for them.
Google Lens, there's a long way to go. But today, as humans, visual input is really big for us. I mean, it's a lot higher bandwidth than everything else. And so bringing back to computing, I think, is a really important step in advancing how users can process information. And so I see that as an important step. And thanks to machine learning, we'll be able to do these things a lot more powerfully. All of this I think, overall, adds to the search experience. And so I view that as all incremental, but it'll play out slowly over many years. And so we see this as a big opportunity ahead and we are investing for it.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good afternoon. The revenue growth was one of the highest growth rates you've seen in five years. I'm just curious if there was something that surprised you in the quarter or something that perhaps was an anomaly that we should be thinking about modeling going forward?
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
So I tried to give you a bit of color going across the major lines. We feel we're really pleased with the sites' revenue growth, the performance in mobile desktop and YouTube. I think if you just go down to the big categories, network revenue also was quite strong. I think one thing to add there is programmatic continues to be a strong contributor. Generate significant growth, we've talked about that on prior calls.
Given all the ongoing advertiser adoption of programmatic buying and AdMob continues to see strength. What you're also seeing here is the traditional AdSense businesses. Overall, the pace of advertiser migration to programmatic affects this business kind of quarter-on-quarter as well as the policy changes that we've talked about in prior quarters. And those factors were less of a drag in the last couple of quarters.
So you actually saw nicer revenue growth year-on-year here as well. It was up 16%. And then Sundar's talked a lot about the components of other revenues up nicely. We're really pleased with what's going on there and then, on top of that, Other Bets. So we've got a couple of components to it and tried to give you color on each one.
Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC

Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thank you. So Sundar, can you talk about how Google is positioning in the emerging markets over the longer term can be different versus what we are used to seeing here in the States. I mean, you talked about Tez in India, and that's just type of stuff that we're not even seeing here in the States. So is there a broader opportunity for you to do a larger land grab with more products?
And Ruth, should we assume that the relative size of the dollar contribution to the other revenue growth happened in the order you gave out in the prepared remarks, I guess, cloud, play, hardware? And if so, this would make it the second quarter in a row in which cloud is showing up as the largest contributor, I guess, as opposed to the third. So any perspective you can share in terms of the relative growth you maybe seeing recently? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On emerging markets, we do see a differentiated opportunity there partly because the characteristics of how truly many of these markets came mobile first, I think, gives rise to different ways users are adopting our products. And also, more importantly, the ecosystem, which is built around, so for example, if you take e-commerce, the kind of models that are emerging in these countries are also a bit different. So I think we see a way to look at these markets with a lot more thought and address them for the opportunity that they have, not just apply our global products there. So I think that's what led us to do Google Tez in India. And we'll thoughtfully look at the opportunities in that region and invest a lot in the years ahead.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And then we do – we did list them in the order in which they're making a contribution. It's obviously a mix of businesses. As we've talked about, we have very strong growth in each of cloud and hardware that was tempered by slightly slower growth in Q3 for Play, reflecting what's the hit-driven nature of that business of gaming. But again, feel really pleased with the progress, momentum that we're seeing in the various businesses. And I guess, the only other thing to notice, obviously, is seasonality on the hardware as we move into the fourth quarter here.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet's second quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]
I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ellen West
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai.
Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2016, filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumption as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today.
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Our revenues of $26 billion in the second quarter demonstrate the ongoing momentum in our businesses with broad-based strength globally. Revenues were up 21% year-on-year, and up 23% in constant currency. Advertising revenues benefitted from the strong performance insights, which was led in particular by tremendous results in mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube.
Healthy growth and network revenues was driven by our programmatic business. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from Cloud, Play and hardware. Our outline for today's call is first I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which include the impact of stock-based compensation. The European commission fine of $2.7 billion is reflected in our GAAP results with the fine displayed as a separate line item for clarity.
In order to assist with comparing this quarter's results to prior periods, we are also providing operating income, net income and EPS results that exclude the impact of the fine. The fine is not reflected in our segment results. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter after which we will take questions.
I will start with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $26 billion up 21% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $364 million or $361 million after the benefits of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 23% year-over-year.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. You can see that our performance was strong in all regions. U.S. revenues were up 23% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. EMEA revenues were $8.5 billion up 14% year-over-year reflecting weakness in the British pound and the euro. Revenues were up 21% in fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $3.7 billion up 28% versus last year and up 27% in fixed FX terms. Other America's revenues which include results from Canada and Latin America were $1.4 billion up 31% versus last year in both reported and fixed FX terms.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results were $10.4 billion up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.3 billion up 27% year-over-year primarily driven by Google related expenses. Specifically, costs associated with operating our datacenters including depreciation, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and hardware related costs.
Operating expenses including the impact of the EC fine are $11.5 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine operating expenses were $8.8 billion up 18% year-over-year. Year-on-year expense growth reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year.
As discussed previously, this affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017, but not the overall size of the expense for the year. In order to transition to the new timing, we made a one-time half year grant in Q1 of this year, which is reflected in elevated year-on-year expense growth in Q2. As a result, stock-based compensation totaled $2 billion up 33% year-over-year. Headcount at the end of thank you quarter was 75,606 up 1,614 people from last quarter.
Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in Cloud for both technical and sales roles consistent with the priority we place on this business. Operating income was $4.1 billion, excluding the impact of the EC fine, operating income was $6.9 billion up 15% versus last year and the operating margin was 26%.
Other income and expense was $245 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% for the second quarter, net income was $3.5 billion and earnings per diluted share were $5.1. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $6.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $8.90.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash, CapEx for the quarter was $2.8 billion. Operating cash flow was $7.4 billion with free cash flow of $4.6 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $94.7 billion of which approximately $57.9 billion or 61% is held overseas.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $25.8 billion up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $18.4 billion in the quarter up 20% year-over-year. The biggest contributors to growth again this quarter were mobile search and YouTube.
Network revenues were $4.2 billion up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing strength of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $3.1 billion up 42% year-over-year, we have been talking about our bigger investment areas within Google and you can see the momentum here reflecting contributions from our newer revenue streams again this quarter on top of the ongoing strength in Play.
Specifically Cloud continues to benefit from the ongoing investments in our go-to-market and product efforts. Hardware continues to grow at a healthy pace year-on-year with the extension of our product line geographically, particularly Google Home and Wi-Fi, the dollar impacted growth was more muted than in prior quarters reflecting seasonality. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.1 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 28% year-over-year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenues, as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenues, continues reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate, driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, which carries lower TAC.
Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $7.8 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 30%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
A couple of Google reminders for the third quarter. Headcount additions tend to be seasonally high in Q3, because that is when we bring on new graduates. In addition, please keep in mind that our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back-half of the year due to the holiday season, particularly as we promote our made-by Google line of hardware products.
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the second quarter, Other Bets revenues were $248 million primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $772 million for the second quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $152 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q 2016. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets, a couple of updates.
Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion, such as our recent introduction of the indoor security camera, Nest Cam IQ as well as geographic expansion both of which support its position as the leading brand in the connected home. In life sciences, in addition to our progress at Verily, Calico has focused its efforts on the basic mechanisms of ageing and three ageing related diseases representing the leading causes of death.
Calico has established more than 20 active collaborations with other life sciences companies and academic institutions. With Loon we recently demonstrated the technology in Peru by successful delivering basic internet connectivity to tens and thousands of people affected by the tragic floods there. We worked in partnership with the Peruvian government and Telefonica.
And our progress with Waymo continues nicely, as it is reflected in the writer program in Phoenix and our recently announced partnerships with Lift and Avis.
Let me wrap up, almost two years after the creation of Alphabet, we see the benefits of our focus within Google and Other Bets and are pleased with the opportunities we have for sustained revenue and earnings growth. We are obviously very happy with the ongoing strength in ads revenue, particularly in Search. Our compelling secular trends continue to drive user adoption and engagement with mobile devices. Our engineering and machine learning acumen enables us to build better experiences for users and advertisers.
We continue to see increasing contributions from our growing non-ads revenue businesses, Play continues to be a strong contributor, in addition we have been making big Bets within Google focused on Cloud, hardware and subscription businesses in YouTube in order to better serve customers, while also building additional and differentiated revenue streams.
These businesses are consistent with and complementary to our core capabilities and leverage our infrastructure, distribution and engineering. We believe we have a compelling runway here. Longer-term we see great opportunity in the businesses we are building in Other Bets. These businesses reflect the incredible engineering talent across Alphabet most notably in machine learning.
Our revenue growth and Alphabet structure give us both the opportunity and confidence to invest in our businesses for the long-term. We are doing that, while being very deliberate about the focus, scale and pace of investment and remain committed to being consciences in our use of all resources. We're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential scaling back and others and sharpening our organizational effectiveness to make the most of the resources available.
Thank you. And let me now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks Ruth. We had a phenomenal quarter. Google continues to lead the shift to AI driven computing. We are working to make this incredible technology available to everyone around the world. It's our focus on infusing our products and platforms with power of machine learning and AI that's driving our success. Today, I'll spend time talking about the areas where we are confidently investing for the future. First the incredible momentum we are seeing in some of our core products followed by machine learning.
Next an update on three of our most promising bets, YouTube, Cloud and our Hardware businesses. And I will conclude the strong performance of our computing and advertising platforms. To start our core products and the AI powering them. Google has always been about using deep computer science and insights to solve some of the world's most complex problems.
People are no longer only using a keyboard, mouse and multi-touch, but are also using emerging inputs like voice and camera to ask questions and get things done in the real world. We are seeing this in the way people interact with the Google Assistant, which is already now available on more than 100 million devices since launching last year and there is more to come. Since we released an Assistant SDK that will enable a wide range of new hardware devices, which will include the Google Assistant.
We now have more than 70 home automation partners on the Assistant on Google Home and Phones, including Honeywell, Logitech and LG. So you can do everyday things around the house using your voice.
At Google IO, we announced Google Lens available later this year. Lens is a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you're looking at and help you take action based on that information. So for example, if you saw a poster for your favorite band, you would be able to take a picture and get relevant information and buy tickets to their next concert.
In Search, a great feature we launched this quarter in the U.S. is job search. To make looking for a job easier for everyone, no matter what line of work you are in. Many of these products that make people's lives easier are being powered by machine learning.
One focus area for us this quarter has been enabling our machine learning algorithms to learn and improve our products much faster. One such research initiative auto ML enables us to pursue approaches to automate the design of machine learning models. Our ability to rapidly deploy the best machine learning in all of our products enabled us this quarter to launch all sorts of new smart features, to help moderate comments, suggest smart replies in Gmail and improved translations.
We rolled out new machine learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos, which now has more than 500 million monthly users who backup 1.2 billion photos and videos every day. I was also pleased that deep minds AlphaGo team was in Beijing for the Future of Go Summit where AlphaGo played against the number one world player Ke Jie.
Since playing AlphaGo Ke Jie has been on a 20 game winning streak. He has said playing AlphaGo as fundamentally changed his understanding of the game. It’s remarkable to see AI have such a profound effect on one of the world's oldest most strategic games. It can have the same impact in so many fields from medicine to science to energy usage and more.
Now let's move to some of our biggest Bets. First YouTube. YouTube now has 1.5 billion monthly viewers and people watch on average 60 minutes a day on their phones and tablets. That's incredible and it helps 1000s of passionate video creators make money. The fastest growing stream for YouTube is in the living room. YouTube watch time on TV screens has nearly doubled year-on-year. This quarter we unveiled six new ad supported YouTube originals from celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres and Kevin Hart, and YouTube creators like Rhett & Link.
Advertiser feedback on these new shows has been extremely positive. Last week our Live TV service YouTube TV had a ten new metro areas across America tripling the markets where it’s available in just four months. And to our next big Bet with great momentum Google Cloud.
Google Cloud Platform, GCP continues to experience impressive growth across products, sectors and geographies and increasingly with large enterprise customers in regulated sectors. To be more specific about our momentum with big customers, in Q2 the number of new deals we closed worth more than $0.5 million is three times what it was last year.
Responding to the growth in existing and new customers around the world, we continue to invest in datacenters to provide them the fastest most reliable service. We opened new Google Cloud regions in Northern Virginia, Singapore, Sydney and London.
We also continue to build out our partnerships, in Q2 we announced an expansion of our partnership at SAP and a new partnership with Nutanix to integrate their products with GCP. So customers can run workloads in hybrid environments, On-Prem and in the Cloud using containers and Kubernetes.
Now let's talk about our Hardware business. Sales of our new family of hardware continue to be encouraging and we are making good progress bringing these devices to more people. Google Home is now available in four countries, the U.S., Canada, Australia and the UK and we have announced its coming to France and Germany in early August.
The Pixel phone continues to be really popular and Google Wi-Fi just launched in Canada, Germany and France to glowing reviews. Every day, I hear of people who love this product and how it has made Wi-Fi work much better in their homes. Shifting gears, our computing and advertising platforms are driving great results for our partners.
There are now more than $2 billion monthly active Android devices around the world. It's really humbling so many choose Android. We're seeing a number of hardware makers launching devices to positive reviews, including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6. At Google IO this quarter, we gave developers early access to Android O, which will focus on vitals like battery life and performance.
And Google Play continues to be a vital distribution platform for developers. An incredible 82 billion apps were downloaded from Google Play in the last year alone. That's 11 apps for every person on earth. We continue to work on the next generation of computing platforms, virtual and augmented realty. By the end of this year, there will be 11 Daydream ready devices on the market from manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and Asus.
Turning to our advertising platforms. Here to machine learning is critical to helping advertisers and app developers analyze data in real time to reach consumers with more useful ads and measure campaign effectiveness. At Google Marketing Next this quarter we launched Google Attribution, a comprehensive measurement tool that allows marketers to measure the impact of their campaigns across devices and channels all in one place with no additional cost.
We also launched new ad formats and bidding features in Universal App Campaigns to help developers grow their user base across Google Play, Search, YouTube, Gmail and the Display Network. At Google IO in 2016, we announced we had driven 2 billion app installs, today that number is more than 5 billion that's amazing growth.
With 90% of transactions still happening offline, we want to help consumers find what they are looking for in brick and mortar stores. Our store visits technology is instrumental and understanding customer behavior that starts online and ends in store. Today, our store visits measurement is the largest program of its kind and we have now measured over 5 billion store visits in 17 countries.
This quarter it also brought local ads and store visits measurement to video. Speaking of video, we are seeing continued success with bumper ads, our six seconds ad format. Both brands and viewers love the format as it's the ideal length to capture attention. L'Oréal, Hasbro, Xbox, Clinique and Neutrogena have all seen great success with bumpers.
And Google Preferred continues to grow, we now have 100s of brands buying Google Preferred in the U.S. nearly triple the number since it launched three years ago. We are now just helping large brands, we are also helping millions of small businesses get to online and grow. Every month Google helps drive 100 billion visits to business websites and creates more than 3 billion direct connections between businesses and their customers. These interactions drive huge economic opportunities and growth for small businesses.
Last month to increase these opportunities, we launched an easy way for millions of small businesses to create a free simple mobile optimized website. Small businesses can do it on a mobile phone in under 10 minutes, using the listing information already available on Google Search and Maps. And finally helping publishers grow their revenues remains a huge focus for us. We're using the power of automation and machine learning to improve our auction algorithms for publishers.
The 50 improvements we have made since 2016 are generating 15% more revenue for publishers using double click ad exchange. Those are the highlights from the second quarter. This week will be another highlight for me, I'm going to Africa for a Google for Nigeria event to announce new products for Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa.
I'm looking forward to seeing first time how technology and Google's products can make a real difference in people's lives. I want to express a very sincere thank you to every Googler who work tirelessly this quarter to bring all of our technology and products to the world.
And to everyone listening thank you, and I hope you are enjoying starting the week off with us. And now back to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS Securities. Your line is now open.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the question, maybe a big picture question directed to Sundar. As you think about the Google Assistant and what it can do medium-to-long term, maybe talk a little bit about how the Assistant as a product could now roll the gap between consumption and utility inside your products versus monetization over time with this specific focus I would love to hear about local in particular? Thank you so much.
Sundar Pichai
It's a good question, when I think about, we have, we are very focused over the long-term to making sure the Assistant can actually help people get things done in the real world. And so obviously when you think about it from that standpoint local becomes important. Over time, just like when the transition happened from desktop to mobile, people's bar for what they expect increased. They wanted more answers, they wanted more immediate gratification, right and that's a continuum and I think you'll see the trends. And so over time we are laser focused on making sure we can deliver against those experiences, and I think local and their particular strength over time both in terms of, the expertise we have built in local as well as our investment in Maps is hopefully paying off.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.
Q – Doug Anmuth
Great, thanks for taking my question. First one for Ruth, I was just hoping you could help us understand at least qualitatively how core margins for the advertising business are trending within the Google segment? And then Sundar just on the Cloud business, I know you talked about four new regions being built out. Can you just talk about your strategy in building out that Cloud infrastructure, how we should think about it in terms of building out extra capacity or whether it's more in line with near-term demand? Thanks.
Ruth Porat
Thanks. So starting with your margin question like as we've often said, we're focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins. We have strong positions in healthy growing areas and are adding really exciting additional growth areas and that's what we mean when we discussed driving long-term revenue and earnings growth. To get a little more specific, the gross margin, this quarter obviously reflects our product mix shift and although the cost of sales is higher as a percentage of revenues, these costs are associated with high growth product areas that enable us to create value for all of our stakeholders. And then on the OpEx side, the second quarter reflects a number of factors, first I think really to your question on an overtime point, you can see the impact of the timing shift in the equity refresh which we discussed previously. Now as a reminder that does abate in the back-half of the year, but you can see it here in the second quarter.
And then what you are also seeing an OpEx growth is the investments in areas that we've spilled out. So for example in R&D you can see the impact of the headcount increases in our priority areas particularly Cloud and machine learning and marketing spend similarly reflects the strategic priority areas we've delineated particularly hardware and YouTube subscription. But as I said in my opening comments, we're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential, we are scaling it back in others, we're focused on organizational effectiveness to make the most of all of our resources and all of that really underpins the goal to sustain both revenue and earnings growth over the longer term.
Q – Doug Anmuth
Thanks that's helpful.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini
Thank you very much. I was just wondering Sundar, you mentioned some of the strength your seeing in GCP. Now I was just wondering if you could share with us, when you do win is there any commonality around the type of workloads that people are choosing you for? And can you share with us any updates on the go-to-market and kind of how you see all about where you've come over the last year, but even more importantly what you need to do to get it where you needed to be over the next 12 months? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
All right, thanks, I would also take Doug's question on the infrastructure too and do it together, since they are related to Cloud. Overall, when we think about our infrastructure obviously we are serving Cloud as well as our internal products which are seeing tremendous growth as well. In terms of serving Cloud customers, we are world-class and available being reliable and those are things we want to stay best-in-class. So, we are clearly planning for that and planning ahead of our infrastructure and we have been consistently doing that.
And Heather in terms of your question about workloads and stuff, we are actually seeing quite a diverse set of used cases across sectors and industries and geographies and so, I would say the breadth of what we have seen it's really surprised me. In terms of go-to-market, I shared an update on last, on that last quarter not sure there is much more interesting to add, we are continuing to do it well, we are scaling up and all the teams and the structure Diana has put in place is beginning to work well. And we are continuing to hire and scale all of this up, as quickly as we can.
Heather Bellini
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney
Yes, I have two questions please. First, one on TAC, Ruth the factors that cause, have been causing characterizing relatively structural the outsize growth of mobile and the rise of programmatic. So there is no particular reason to think that, we should see anything other than gradual increase in TAC as a percentage of both O&O and network revenue going forward. So are there any reasons why that wouldn't be the case, next year or two? And then Sundar, another one more interesting innovations, that was, that kind of came out of Google IO was Visual Search, and can you just talk about, maybe a little bit roadmap for that or to the extent that which, how long it will take us actually see that broadly in the market, and what you think the appetite or how do you think that will change the way people search for products in the future they build need to also search visually through your phone? Thank you.
Ruth Porat
So on the first question, there are obviously a number of factors that affect Sites TAC we've talked about them over time. The primary driver again this quarter, as you noted in question was the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC. But the increase in Sites TAC year-over-year, I think what I would stress is it really provides another lens on just how strong our mobile business is. There are other factors that affect the TAC rate including the mix of paid versus organic traffic as well as changes in partner mix and agreement terms. But I think at the, main point of your question here is we do continue to expect Sites TAC to increase, but our focus remains on growing profit dollars and I go back to my comment which is really pleased with the strength of our mobile business, which is benefiting profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases. And programmatic, kind of a very similar answer which is we're pleased to have a strong position in the growing area.
Sundar Pichai
And questions around Visual Search, when we think about Google Lens, we think about it as a set of capabilities which will roll out across many different products. But we will mainly start getting it in the hands of our users in Q4. I think early days we want to make sure works well for used cases where it can and bet on the long-term trends in computer vision as we make progress there. I also think, there are cases where pulling out your phone and looking at it is a bit cumbersome and so over time as form factors emerge, there its more natural for you to look at and input that into computing you will get used more.
Overall, for humans the way they see, visual input is a very high bandwidth way of communicating and so, it's important that we bring that in computing. So, long-run I'm very bullish on it, but we're going to roll this out slowly and thoughtfully.
Mark Mahaney
Thank you, Sundar. Thank you, Ruth.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Peter Stabler
Thanks so much for the question. One for Sundar, at Marketing Next your team unveiled new ways that Google is leveraging consumer intense signals across your billion user plus platforms. It seems that some of the walls between product data silos are being lowered a bit, one of the obvious gains that [Street Harp] [ph] highlighted was search personalization. Wondering if you could speak broadly to the opportunity and looking at data from a targeting perspective more holistically across platforms? Thanks so much.
Sundar Pichai
I think it's important we have always felt as marketers when they spend and try to reach users, the more we can give them visibility about how their spend is working and they can attribute across all the stages of the funnel. I think that will really help make everything work well. So, we have always taken the long-term view. And everything we do be it store versus which we did a while ago or more recently at Google Marketing Next we talked about Google Attribution as well. So, all that starts adding up and I think pushes in this right long-term deduction. And there is more work to be done. But, I think as users use our -- use everything across multiple products and devices in a thoughtful way, I think making all of this work well, we see it as an opportunity ahead of us.
Peter Stabler
Thanks Sundar.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak
Thanks for taking my questions today. I have two. The first one you talked about micro moments throughout the course of the year and micro moments on mobile. I was wondering, could you give us a couple of examples of micro moments or searching verticals where you have really seen an increase in your monetization over the last year.
And Sundar, as you look out across all the search verticals, what are the two biggest one or two used cases you still see to improve the overall relevancy of search results and potential monetization?
Sundar Pichai
On the first one, I would probably be rather than be very specific, any time people are looking to buy, find, go do things, you could be looking for a local pizza or you could be buying -- we see craze like jeans near me and people are looking for jeans next to them. So these are all very, very specific things and in all of these cases, we have found we have been able to impact the experience for both users and advertisers.
So, I think that applies generally broadly, in terms of all the verticals, I think there are a lot of opportunities local has been an area of strength for us. We have seen a lot of traction and continue to think as a vertical given the assets we have built over the years we can continue to invest more and do better for our users.
Brian Nowak
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ross Sandler
Great. I have two questions for Sundar. First is, as you mentioned 15% yield improvement on publisher yield for [indiscernible] from machine learning, is there a comparable step inside of Google owned and operated search or YouTube after implementing machine learning you saw yield improvement of x, be curious hear to that.
And then, the second question is, if you look out into the future, you guys mentioned 2 billion Android actives I/O and you mentioned 11 apps per user in your prepared remarks. Is Google forced to unbundle their own apps from Android in the future. What's the strategy to ensure that maps and YouTube and search get distribution and Android doesn't kind of go the way of China and other markets, be curious to hear that? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
Let me take the first one first. On machine learning, we definitely machine learning we have been using it on search, Rank Brain has become one of the important signals in addition to the many other signals and search. And so, definitely that's had an impact same on YouTube across the board. I don't have any specific metrics to give but we definitely are seeing impact and we think we are in early days of the impact we can see.
In terms of Android, we are obviously thoughtfully building Android out and scaling it out and we offer our apps as part of it. OEMs get to distribute other apps as well. We think it's a very open market, open ecosystem works well for everyone involved and I expect that to continue. And a lot of our products which are successful on Android happen to be successful outside of Android as well including on the web. These are products generally used by billions of users and by now we have worked hard to earn that trust and scale and so I'm confident we can continue scaling this up.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Dan Salmon
Hey, good afternoon everyone. Sundar, I think the last update we heard publicly on promoted places on maps was in December when you announced that you would be beginning some limited tests. I don't think there has been any public comment from the company since then quite frankly haven't heard a whole lot anecdotally about it either. So, I was just hoping for a quick update on that product? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
Overall, I mean it's in the area where we are still like really focused on improving the consumer experience I think. We are evolving maps to be a lot more beyond just driving directions and users are responding to it. And I think we are in the process of making all that work better. And also, we've also focused in terms of what we see as local opportunity within search as well. But, we will continue testing and evolving, I think we want to make sure we get the consumer experience right before we invest before on promoter opportunities on maps.
Dan Salmon
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post
Great. A few for Ruth. First, I'm wondering if you could comment at all on the cloud business profitability, medium or long-term, how you are thinking about that. Second, I would go ahead and take a short at the EC decision lately, clearly it is material for financials. How are you thinking about approaching that decision, and does that impact any of your other advertising businesses as far as innovation? And then finally, any thoughts on verticals that were strong this quarter that supported the organic revenue growth? Thank you.
Ruth Porat
So, on -- as you know, we don't break out by product, just adding a bit more color on cloud. We are clearly excited about the opportunity we have here and it does continue to drive sizable revenue growth as I said in my opening comments as did Sundar and we are seeing momentum in the business. I think the comment that Sundar made about the number of new deals over 500,000 increasing 3x year-on-year gives you an indication of the momentum in the business. It's obviously not a financial forecast but it does display the traction we are having with cloud in the market and GCP remains one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet, G-suite continues to have strong growth.
So, we are really pleased with what that means for both the longer term trends in the profitability. We do believe that from -- the many years of investment we have already made and things like technical infrastructure and security which operate with tremendous efficiency that provides us with a benefit, but near term we are investing meaningfully in sales and engineering service support -- continuing to expand out regions to make sure that we are delivering the best experience for our enterprise customers and that's what we are really focused on.
In terms of I think your second question was the EC there was really not much of an update there, we are still early in our analysis of the decision in the right next steps and we do have time to notify the commission of proposed remedies as well as implement changes. The main thing is, we are very focused on helping users and advertisers and our reviewing our options it's an ongoing matter. So, there is not much more to comment on that one.
And then, the third question --
Justin Post
On verticals that were strong?
Ruth Porat
Yes. In terms of -- I think that what you are trying to get out here on what are seeing in particular with sites revenue and there is not anyone thing to call out whether it's by vertical or steps that we are taking. And that's really what I would point you to more. I think it's an important point that we are very excited about the opportunities here given both the underlying secular trends broadly with mobile. Sundar talked a lot about that. But, also all that we are able to layer on top of it just given the engineering acumen here and we talked about this on prior calls, it's true again here this quarter that one change has been driving the results and so what you are seeing is the combined benefit of a number of changes we have made. It's really this maniacal focus on all elements of the user and advertiser experience and nothing to call out by vertical.
Justin Post
Thank you, Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May of Citi. Your line is now open.
Mark May
Thanks for taking my questions. I think this first one is for Sundar. Data of course is a key differentiator and there is a lot of advertising, so maybe you could talk about how you've changed your use of Google search data and recently in areas outside of search and how that is or might impact the effectiveness of advertising on channels like YouTube and others outside of search?
And then, Ruth, in your prepared remarks you mentioned tremendous growth in mobile search in the quarter, I think that's a more emphatic statement in recent quarters, hoping that maybe you could provide more color on some of the areas where you are seeing the change and quite trajectory coming from within mobile search? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai
On your first question, obviously, we do these things with the foremost thing being making sure, we do the right things for user privacy. But, within our own products we are trying to help users get a better experience across on the consumer side and the advertising side and I think there is opportunity there. And so, we will be thoughtful as we move forward.
Ruth Porat
And then on mobile search, I think what you are hearing is, we are really pleased with the ongoing efforts there and as I just said there was not one change that really drove this, what extraordinary about the team is, with the focus on users and advertisers, what is it that is most useful Sundar has spoke about some of them with local, but it's really again -- it's a lot of small incremental efforts that in the aggregate continue to enable us to benefit from what’s a really nice underlying secular trend here. And that's what we are seeing in the results again.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from --
Mark May
Nothing around, are you listening to this? It's something around like geography or platforms or…
Ruth Porat
Not sure, if that was directed to me or but in terms of geography I think hopefully one of the benefits the way we recast the data here last quarter was, so you can actually get a bit more insight into what's going on around the globe. And that's why I made the comment that we are having a really broad strength globally. You can see it in each one of the regions here. U.S. continues to deliver strong growth engagement across products, if you look at EMEA on a fixed FX basis up 21%, you can see the same in APAC, the same in other Americas. So, yes, there is broad based strength across geographies and I think -- I'm not calling out one particular area because the -- what you are seeing here is the secular trend I have used that term a couple of times now. And we are continuing to benefit from that around the globe. And we are continuing to benefit from on top of that the efforts of our team.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Steven Ju
Okay. Thank you. Sundar, I was just wondering if you could give us some sense of advertiser option particularly among your retail appliance the store visit product, as it seems like there has been a large opportunity to drive offline purchasing. And Ruth, can you give us some sense of any headwinds you might be seeing in your streams of your revenue away from Play or GCP in the LNO revenue line as we have just knocked that across and just seeing a sequentially flat revenue line there. Thanks.
Sundar Pichai
I think I spoke about it in my opening remarks. But, since [indiscernible] measurement was announced three years ago advertisers have mentioned over 5 billion store visits globally. And I think we are just doing -- we have just badly scratched the surface. But, our marketing next in May we announced that the store visit measurement will also rollout for YouTube TrueView campaigns and we will be rolling out store sales measurement in the coming months. So, advertisers can actually measure in-store revenue, store visits delivered by search and shopping apps.
So, we have had good proof points advertisers who have used it, for example, Virgin Holidays used it, factored in store sales measurements and they realized their search campaigns generate double the profit comparatively looking at online KPIs alone. So, I think there is a lot of opportunity there. And so, we will do more by over time.
Ruth Porat
And then, you asked on the other revenue line it was up nicely again this quarter 42% year-on-year and that obviously includes the impact of FX. It's obviously a mix of businesses including some of our bigger investment areas, most notably cloud and hardware and as I said at the outset Play continues to perform really well.
I think if you are asking about the quarter-on-quarter sequentially you noted, we are talking about a mix of businesses that have different characteristics and just state the obvious Play is more hit driven. It's highly seasonal, hardware is also seasonal. So, the year-on-year provides a better sense to the dynamics of the business and that's where you can see in this line up year-on-year really nicely this quarter.
Steven Ju
Okay. Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
Colin Sebastian
Thank you. Maybe just one question for Sundar. I wonder if you could update us on your thoughts regarding the conversions of Chrome and Android operating systems. And in particular I'm curious whether the emergence of Google Assistant and Voice as a corollary across devices is a reason to move forward more integration between the two platforms. Thanks.
Sundar Pichai
Look I'm -- I mean we have been thoughtfully doing it in putting users first and I'm excited at how Android apps are coming to Chromebooks and we see that as a great opportunity and I think that will help us deliver a very compelling experience. And we just have started doing at this year and I expected to really get momentum as we go through to the next year.
So, that's an example of conversions and I think that will work really well and so. And in terms of products like Google Assistant and Voice, I think we will make sure for users it doesn't matter and they work across every platform they use including our platforms as well as other people's platform. So, we think about making sure our services free as many users as possible and so we are working on that as well.
Colin Sebastian
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of John Blackledge of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
John Blackledge
Great. Two questions, so for Sundar or Ruth, within cloud could you talk about your view of G Suites enterprise penetration right now, kind of key drivers of the adoption longer term. And if you view it as a potential differentiator for Google Cloud versus other large competitors. And then, within YouTube 60 minutes per day of viewing on phones and tablets obviously incredible at that scale. Any thoughts on kind of what could drive further material viewing or engagement growth over time? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
And maybe on YouTube I would say, YouTube is one of those products which is scaling really well globally just like search did and we are seeing real strong growth on mobile. And we are seeing real strong growth for YouTube on emerging markets as well. And we are seeing real strong growth on television.
So, if I look at YouTube on mobile on emerging markets on larger screens, they all look like newer opportunities and so I think there is a lot more growth ahead.
And on cloud, I think we have kind of answered it. Obviously, we see differentiated strengths and machine learning, data analytics, security and reliability. And the combination of not just GCP, G Suite working together with GCP, we are seeing increasing win rates and option across enterprise customers. And I also think all the investments we are doing in terms of broadening our ecosystem including the newer partnerships with the companies I mentioned earlier that should begin to payoff.
And overall, the return on investment from the hiring and region expansion we are doing. So, I think we are set-up incredibly well and look forward to the momentum ahead.

Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues of $24.8 billion in the first quarter demonstrate our broad-based strength globally, with revenues up 22% year on year. In constant currency, our consolidated revenues grew 24% versus 1Q 2016. Growth in advertising revenues was again driven by mobile search, with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from Play, hardware, and Cloud.
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I will focus on year-over-year changes in our results. As a reminder, I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which includes stock-based compensation for operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $24.8 billion, up 22% year over year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $304 million or $87 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year over year.
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, as you can see in our press release, we've enhanced the geographic split to give you more insight into our businesses around the world. We are now reporting our revenues in four regions: the U.S., EMEA – namely Europe, Middle East, and Africa – APAC or Asia Pacific, and Other Americas, which encompasses Canada and Latin America. To help you with the transition to our new geographic reporting, we're also sharing the U.K. revenues for this quarter. These groupings align more closely with how we manage our businesses and also with the major currencies that affect our results.
The results by region highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenues were up 25% year over year to $11.8 billion. EMEA revenues were $8.1 billion, up 13% year over year. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 19%. U.K.-reported revenues continue to reflect the ongoing weakness of the British pound, with revenues up 5% year over year to $2 billion on a reported basis, yet up 16% in fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $3.6 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 26% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strength of the Australian dollar and yen. Other Americas revenues, which include results from Canada and Latin America, were up 34% versus last year to $1.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 29% year over year, with fixed FX growth reflecting strength in the Brazilian real.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $9.8 billion, up 28% year on year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.2 billion, up 34% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses – specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, as well as hardware-related costs reflecting the continued strong performance of our new Made by Google product line. Operating expenses were $8.4 billion in the quarter, up 15% year over year.
Year-on-year comparisons in part reflect the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle, with a half-year grant in Q1, which enables us to move to a single annual compensation cycle. As discussed last quarter, this affects the timing of stock-based compensation but does not affect the overall size of the SBC expense for the year. The year-on-year increase is therefore more sizable in Q1 and Q2 compared to previous years, with less of a year-on-year impact in both Q3 and Q4. More specifically, stock-based compensation totaled $2 billion, up 34% year over year.
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 73,992, up 1,939 people from last quarter. The growth in consolidated head count was somewhat muted by an internal reallocation of people from Fiber to Google. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count growth was in Cloud, consistent with the priority we place on this business.
Operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating margin was 27%. Other income and expense was $251 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 20% for the first quarter. Net income was $5.4 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $7.73.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $2.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.5 billion, with free cash flow of $7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $92.4 billion, of which approximately $55.7 billion or 60% is held overseas.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $24.5 billion, up 22% year over year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $17.4 billion in the quarter, up 21% year over year. The biggest contributor to growth again this quarter was mobile search, reflecting the secular shift to mobile due to the greater utility of smartphones for users and advertisers, but obviously also benefiting from our focus on continuously enhancing features and functionality. YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising. Network revenues were $4 billion, up 9% year on year, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob. Results benefited from a slower rate of decline in the traditional Network business than in prior periods, although it continues to be negatively affected by both the ongoing shift by advertisers to programmatic and our ongoing policy efforts. Other revenues for Google were $3.1 billion, up 49%.
Last quarter we talked about our bigger investment areas, and you can see the strong momentum here, reflecting contributions from each of Play, hardware, and Cloud. Specifically, Play benefited from both broad-based app strength but also from all the work we have done in areas such as direct carrier billing, which helps more people globally access and buy their favorite apps and games on Google Play. Hardware continues to have strong growth and remains an important area for us, with our family of products extending geographically. Google Cloud continues to drive sizable growth, with Google Cloud Platform remaining one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.6 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 22% year over year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenues, as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenues, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year over year as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate, driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, which carries lower TAC.
Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year over year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $244 million, primarily generated by Nest, Verily, and Fiber. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $855 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $170 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q 2016.
Let me conclude. First, we've benefited from our team's innovations that continually enhance our advertising business, as evidenced by the ongoing growth of Sites revenues. On a dollar basis, the increase in Sites revenues reflects the healthy growth in mobile search. As we discussed in prior calls, even though mobile revenue growth requires an increasing investment in the mobile ecosystem in the form of higher TAC, our strength in mobile search is adding meaningfully to profit dollars.
Second, the strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams, including those from Cloud, hardware, and YouTube subscription offerings. Cloud is one of our most important strategic priorities given the scale of opportunity in a rapidly evolving sector and the fact that the requirements for success align with many of our strengths. We will continue to invest here for the long-term opportunity. Similarly, hardware remains an exciting growth opportunity for us, and you've seen the early indicators again this quarter.
Finally in Other Bets, we're determining the size and pace of investment appropriate to each bet, given their stage of development and achievements against milestones. We expect to increase near-term investment in certain areas while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment in others as they move along a path to commercialization. For example, as I hope you saw earlier this week, Waymo announced it has commenced a trial of its self-driving cars in the Phoenix area. Waymo also announced it is expanding its fleet of minivans to support this trial. These actions reflect the tremendous accomplishment of our team over many years, leading with safety, and now beginning to bring the experience to consumers.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Ruth. It's been a terrific start to the year. This quarter was notable for the fantastic momentum across our products. Advances for the Google Assistant, the launch of YouTube TV, and lots of new features launched at our Google Cloud Next event. In the next few weeks, there's much more to come. We'll host our annual developer conference, Google I/O; our advertising event, Google Marketing Next; and our YouTube upfront, Brandcast. I hope you'll join us.
Today I'll discuss three things. First, how our continued investments in machine learning are fueling innovation across Google, and particularly how it's helping drive our core mission of providing access to information for everyone. Second, progress in three of our biggest bets: YouTube, Cloud, and hardware. And, third, our platforms, such as Android and our advertising platform, which power businesses and computing experiences around the world.
Now, turning first to machine learning and access to information. I'm really happy with how we are transitioning to an AI-first company. The Google Assistant is one of our first steps towards that future. This quarter, we brought the Assistant to your wrist with Android Wear 2.0, announced that it'll soon come to Android TV, and began rolling it out to hundreds of millions of people with Android phones running Nougat and Marshmallow. We also continue to announce new integration partners for the Google Assistant, so you can now ask it to do things like dim the living room lights. Stay tuned for more to come.
Advances in machine learning are helping us make many Google products better. One example from this quarter is the launch of parking predictions in Google Maps. Beyond that, we continue to set the pace in machine learning and AI research. We introduced a new technique for training deep neural networks on mobile devices called Federated Learning. This technique enables people to run a shared machine learning model while keeping their underlying data stored locally on mobile phones. DeepMind is bringing AlphaGo to China in May, pairing AI with the world's best players at the Future of Go Summit. And it's very exciting to see the incredible things that developers and researchers are building on the TensorFlow platform. There are more than 6,000 GitHub projects and counting.
Search remains at the heart of our mission to make information available to everyone, and we are laser-focused on making Search even better. In March, we introduced tappable shortcuts in Google Search to help you easily access topics you care about, like sports, entertainment, and weather. And, earlier this week, to improve our results further, we introduced algorithmic ranking improvements, as well as easier ways for people to provide better (17:28) feedback in autocomplete and Featured Snippets. Last week, we made big improvements to one of our longest-standing and most loved products, Google Earth. It's really beautiful and easy to use. Now you can experience breathtaking locations in virtual reality, like the top of Table Mountain in South Africa.
Moving on to three of our biggest bets: YouTube, Cloud, and hardware. First, YouTube, where we continue to see extraordinary growth and opportunities. People around the world are watching more content on YouTube than ever before. In 2016, we passed a big milestone that continues to grow. Every day, users watch over a billion hours on YouTube. YouTube continues to be the most popular destination for online video globally, and we are focused on building awesome experiences.
This quarter we announced YouTube TV, which offers live TV from major broadcast and cable networks, a cloud-based DVR without storage limits, and streaming on all of your devices. We have launched in five cities so far, and the positive feedback from customers has been really incredible. Our destination for family and kids' content, called YouTube Kids, also recently celebrated its second birthday. There have been more than 30 billion video views in the app to date.
Next, our growing Cloud business. Our Google Cloud Next conference in March was a great opportunity to highlight core areas of differentiation for GCP, like new security products and the recognition that we had the highest cloud availability in 2016, according to CloudHarmony. It was attended by five times as many people as last year. We also demonstrated new machine learning services and announced our acquisition of Kaggle, the largest community of data centers focused on machine learning and AI. We introduced dozens of new products, including Spanner, a database optimized for distributed computing that can reliably update data across multiple data centers. And our G Suite team introduced a major expansion of or collaboration platform with Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. To give you a taste of the kinds of large enterprise customers and partners we are now working with across GCP, we were joined on stage by major companies like HSBC, Home Depot, Schlumberger, and SAP, as well as large G Suite customers, including Colgate-Palmolive.
We continue to see tremendous momentum in education, where our products are leading the industry, thanks to their simplicity, security, and low cost. Chromebooks are now used by more than 20 million teachers and students, and more than 70 million people actively use G Suite for Education.
Over the last several months, we have noticed a change in the types of conversations that Diane and her team are having with customers. Increasingly, we are being asked to partner for mission-critical projects and full migrations, moving data from on-prem data centers to the cloud. We are seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business.
On to our next big bet, hardware. Last year, we debuted a beautiful new family of hardware devices, including the Pixel, Google Home, and Google Wifi, bringing together the best of Google across hardware and software. We are finding that people who buy products like Pixel and Google Home are not only incredibly happy with their purchase but also very likely to recommend it to others. Sales continues to be strong, and we are actively working to bring these great devices to more people around the world. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that Google Home and Google Wifi are now available in the U.K. Speaking of Google Home, last week we made it possible for up to six people to connect their accounts to one Google Home, and thanks to a leading voice recognition technology, it can recognize who's speaking to it. It's really a game changer.
And, finally, we are continuing to invest in our computing and advertising platforms. Our platforms have had great success over the years, creating incredible user experiences, as well as real opportunities and economic success for partners, creators, and developers around the globe. To illustrate, in the past three years in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa alone, we paid out more than $15 billion to our publisher, creator, and app developer partners. That's across AdSense, YouTube, and Google Play, and it doesn't even include device sales by many hardware partners who build on Android. There's tremendous momentum in the Android ecosystem, as evidenced by the great reception of the beautiful Samsung Galaxy S8. We'll have much more to say at I/O next month.
In March, we introduced the first developer preview of Android O, featuring improvements for battery life, notifications, and picture-in-picture display. The Android platform is also seeing great growth in emerging markets. In 2016, nearly 300 million new users adopted Android devices from countries like India and Brazil. We also announced the public launch of Android Wear 2.0, with two new flagship watches from LG. And thanks to partnerships with major brands like TAG and Fossil, there'll be more than 20 different Android Wear watches available this year, doubling the number from last year.
Our virtual reality platform Daydream, which debuted almost a year ago, continues to gain traction with more devices and more great content, like VR video. More than 50% of time in Daydream is video consumption, and YouTube VR is Daydream's number 1 app by time spent.
Lastly, I'll talk about the highlights and trends we are seeing across our growing advertising business, where there are still enormous opportunities. As you can see from our results, we continue to experience remarkable growth worldwide. Not only are existing advertisers choosing to spend more as they see the value of our ads, but many more businesses around the world are just getting started on our ad platforms, from India to Brazil and many more. Our momentum continues to be driven by the shift to mobile. Our great properties, like Search, Maps, YouTube, and Google Play, are the prime time for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested.
We have increased our investment in machine learning in our advertising business, with efforts like Smart Bidding, where our systems predict the performance of an ad and adjust advertisers' bids in real time to maximize their results. Two areas where we are seeing particular strength are retailers and app developers. Mobile has transformed the shopping experience. In the past year, local shopping queries have increased by 45%, and the number of retailers that provide us with their local inventory feeds has doubled. Our investments in innovative ad formats, include targeting and better measurement, are really helping retailers, who see us as an ally in their corner. Brands like Williams-Sonoma have seen a 70% increase in mobile sales year over year, with Google mobile shopping ads playing a big part.
Secondly, developers use us to help their apps stand out from the crowd. Thanks to our app install advertising products, developers have already driven more than 5 billion app downloads. Our flagship product here, Universal App Campaigns, allows developers to easily promote their apps across Google Search, Play, YouTube, and the Google Display Network. It incorporates machine learning to improve campaigns and drive great results for advertisers. We recently announced new innovations at the Game Developers Conference, including an interactive playable ad format in Universal App Campaigns that lets users play a lightweight version of your game right in the ad. It's really effective in driving installs from engaged users.
Now on to our growing video advertising business. Brands love the reach and engagement that they get across YouTube, along with the effectiveness of formats like TrueView skippable ads and our new bumper ads, which are snackable six-second videos that drive incremental reach and frequency. We recently did research on more than 120 bumper ad campaigns, and the data showed that they drove a significant lift in brand awareness and ad recall. Under Armour used both bumper ads and TrueView together to promote a new product launch recently, resulting in double the lift in product interest among people who saw both ads compared to those who only saw the TrueView ad. We work incredibly hard to create the best environment for brands on YouTube. The cornerstone of our offering is Google Preferred, which allow brands to advertise against the top 5% of our content.
We also announced new safeguards for advertisers through a combination of updated ad policies and enforcement, new default settings around where ads can appear, improved controls for advertisers, and third-party brand safety reporting. Brands and agencies understand how hard we work to create the safest possible environment. We do this by also being very careful to ensure YouTube's innovative creators can earn money to support their unique and popular content. We've been actively engaged in conversations with clients about the new tools and controls we are providing, and we are having very productive discussions ahead of Brandcast next week.
Finally, programmatic advertising. As marketers continue to shift towards programmatic ad buying, our DoubleClick platform makes it easy for them to effectively reach the right audiences. We've been focusing on making more inventory available to more advertisers, especially premium inventory. For instance, we recently expanded our Programmatic Guaranteed reservation product to advertisers globally, and we made traditional TV inventory available to buy in DoubleClick Bid Manager.
So that's a run-through of some highlights for the quarter. Thanks to every Googler for making Google such an exciting and inspiring place to work every day. Over the last few days, we have had Take Your Child to Work Day at Google, which is one of my favorite events of the year. We have had thousands of excited, screaming kids running around the Googleplex, which is how I feel some days, too. What motivates us at Google is building the technologies that'll be central to all of their computing experiences, to give them opportunities to learn, to be heard, and to succeed.
And with that, I will hand it back over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I had two. First, just, you talked about Cloud as a huge strategic priority. Could you just talk more about the go-to-market strategy for GCP and how you plan on building up the reseller channel there going forward? And then secondly, Sundar, on Waymo, I was curious on some of your thoughts. I know it's early, but on the timing for Waymo to become commercially viable. And then what are the key guideposts and requirements along the way? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On the Cloud stuff, talking about go-to-market, as Ruth said in Q1, our largest growth in head count and CapEx was in Cloud. So we are thrilled with the progress we have made there since Diane arrived, building our world-class sales, marketing, and engineering teams. The heavy lifting, I would say, is around how we meet enterprises in the market. We have reorganized so we have one face to the customer. So it's not just sales reps. We've been thoughtful about how we have built out the entire go-to-market organization.
So we created two new areas that customers can now take advantage of. One is the office of the CTO, which helps customers solve difficult technical problems. And the second is our Advanced Solutions Lab, where customers can get help from machine learning experts. And on top of that, now we have a phenomenal support team that helps keeps customers' applications up and running. So I think what we have done – our approach is one Google. When a customer sings up for Google Cloud, they get more than GCP and G Suite. They have access to the ads and analytics teams, YouTube teams, and resources within our organization. So I think it's coming along quite well.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And then on your question on Waymo, we view Waymo as a great example of a graduate from X that's addressing a sizable problem and builds off of tremendous technology here. We started with safety; we remain a leader in safety. And we continue to view that as the foundation for success. And at this point we're exploring many options enabling ridesharing, personal-use vehicles, logistics, and deliveries, and we also see opportunities to work with cities to address public transportation.
So the announcements that we made this week are a continuation of the progress the team has made. We do have a strong relationship with Fiat Chrysler, increased our car order, given the opportunity. They have been our primary partner to date, but to note we're in active discussions with others around the globe. And then I think, importantly, the trial in the Phoenix area is something that's been in the works for some time, and we do look forward for that trial. So it's still in the early days, and we're excited about the upside from Waymo.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you both.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you. I also wanted to ask a question about Cloud as a follow-up. I was just wondering, Sundar, if you could share with us what's the feedback been since Next from your Cloud customers? And could you share with us how qualitatively – something so we can gauge just kind of whether this business is starting to see an inflection in growth or not? Is there anything you could give us qualitatively about how the pipeline is building in this area? And I guess just what I'm interested in is also the types of conversations you're having with customers now versus maybe six years ago. I'm sorry – six months ago. Sorry about that. Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Time flies fast. Next was – having done Google I/O many, many times, I was surprised to see the scale and growth of Next from even last year to this year. We had five many times as people. I think everyone really appreciated seeing large customers, very sophisticated customers, like HSBC, eBay, Colgate-Palmolive, et cetera, discussing use of Google Cloud, GCP. Along with Diane, I did follow-up lunches with a set of people, and so the feedback has been very positive. People sense our commitment to the area. They understand the pace at which we are investing. They see that we are committed to machine learning and AI at a deep level. They appreciate how we are open-sourcing things. Facetalk was extraordinarily well-received. They are noticing the acquisitions we are making, Kaggle and AppBridge are a couple of acquisitions which happened around that time. So all that, all those details, I think clearly made an impact. I just spoke about the go-to-market progress, and I think that's beginning to get traction as well.
In general, I think there is a very strong recognition that we are have pivoted to being a deep enterprise company, and our conversations are very strategic. We are engaging at the highest levels within companies. And so, overall, I can see qualitative lead and momentum there. When we are in the middle of deals, we find we are very competitive, and there are areas where customers perceive us as best-in-class already. So it's been exciting to see.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, you mentioned Google Assistant in your remarks. Wanted to know, what have you seen in terms of consumer adoption of Google Assistant, whether at the Pixel level or the Google Home level? What does it give you in terms of sense of how people want to interact with the Assistant? What it might do in terms of putting artificial intelligence capabilities down to the consumer level and improve consumer experiences over the next couple years? Thanks so much for the color.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Good question, Eric. Pixel is a good example, because I think it's the place where we do the leading work here. And how we presented Google Assistant and the Pixel – well-received, both qualitatively in terms of consumer feedback we get, quantitatively in terms of how we see people using voice, how we see people interacting with overall Google Assistant and Search better. So we find that when we drive the Assistant experience well, it works overall in helping people engage with Google at a broader level.
It's always surprising to us – we always said, even with Search, every single day we see so many new types of queries. When you bring the assistant into the mix, you start getting even more different tips of queries, and queries are more casual, more conversational. And so over time I think it starts breaking down the barriers to computing people have, and that's what makes it very, very exciting.
Now, artificial intelligence will help us push all that further. Just to give an example, we will make text to speech much, much better over time. Yesterday, we announced our Neural Machine Translation is launching in nine new languages. So all that starts accruing to the Assistant, and I think we'll overall improve the customer experience pretty dramatically. We'll talk about all this a lot more at Google I/O, so stay tuned.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great, thanks. Two questions, please. One on YouTube and one on Google Maps. Sundar or Ruth, there was some press about some of the pushback or some of the controversy around content and advertising and monetization of that. Are those technical problems that can be solved over time? Or is just the magnitude or the volume of content in trying to keep bad content off the site, however that's defined, and keep it from being monetized, is that an ongoing technology challenge or did you already find a solution? Then did you see any material impact to advertisers' budget interest with YouTube? And then if you could also comment briefly on Google Maps. This is one of those massive properties that you've owned that's highly used by almost everybody, and I think the monetization to date has been really de minimis. Is there anything that's changed for you in terms of your thought about the ability to monetize Google Maps over time? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On advertising and monetization in YouTube, we talked a bit about it. We have taken it pretty seriously, and we are taking significant steps. And obviously as part of doing that, we have brought new technical solutions into place. Machine learning is a great example of it. It helps us enforce – as we improve our policies, it helps us enforce it better. And we are in early days, so as machine learning gets better, I think we'll be able to do all of this even better and create that virtuous cycle.
Overall, I'm pretty confident at the rate at which we have made progress. And we're going to continue investing a lot here. It is super important to us that this ecosystem works well. It matters for advertisers. It matters for content creators. And so we take that responsibility very seriously. I would say advertisers have clearly noticed all the improvements we have made. Our conversations with them are very, very positive, and so I'm pretty optimistic about how we'll continue to make progress here.
On Google Maps, your question is – it's a good question. I get surprised at, for a property which we had launched many, many years ago, even now it's showing strong growth, especially in emerging markets. Maps is an integral part of your mobile phone. And users get more interested in the real world around them with AR and so on, I think Maps will continue to play a bigger role. We take a long-term view. It's already impacting monetization very significantly for us with local search. So today, when you use Google, a lot of the information we are able to do is because of Google Maps. But I'm sure you've noticed changes within Google Maps over the past few months. If you open Google Maps, you're traveling or you're out on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more interesting information about what you can do, places to eat, and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from users, and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there over time as well.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you, Sundar.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to follow up on Mark's question on the local opportunity. Assuming that you agree it's a large one, what kind of steps are you taking to educate the smaller businesses out there on the opportunities you have? You've mentioned increasing take-up of local inventory ads. We understand that. But more generally, a go-to-market strategy on how you reach the millions of SMBs out there in terms of educating them on the growing opportunities on a local basis. Thanks so much.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
It's a great question. And I think there's a lot of opportunity for us. Today we have many touch points. Obviously people – we reach out to SMBs, they want to get listed in Search and in Maps. AdWords Express has been a big part of how they want to advertise on our platforms. We obviously provide things like Google Apps to SMBs. So we have a lot of touch points, and internally we are beginning to do a much better job of reaching out and having a more thoughtful go-to-market approach. I think there's a lot more work there, but the rate at which we are seeing advertisers – small, medium businesses – on our platform has been growing very, very strongly as well. So indications are that it's already currently working at scale. We have millions and millions of SMBs on our platform, and the number continues to grow very well. But you'll see us invest a lot more here in the years ahead.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you, Sundar.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit more about the retail search category? Any high-level commentary on consumer search-query trends in retail, either an area of strength or otherwise? And then you talked about the real-time local-inventory integration, but, Sundar, I'd be curious if you could talk about any opportunities or areas of innovation in the retail search space that you see to really continue to improve users' retail-search experience. Thanks for the color.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
I think obviously when we see what users are looking for in mobile, how shopping is evolving, it's an area we're continuously working on. I've been happy to see the evolution in our shopping experiences. Retail overall also happens to be an amazing category for us from a Google Cloud standpoint, so in some ways we are developing deeper partnerships with retailers around the world. And so as we start doing that, and I think as we get a better understanding of their inventory and the data, how we can translate all of that into our core experience is a bit of the work ahead. I think that's what excites us about the longer term. Shorter term, I think it's a space we continue to invest in. We are actually seeing strong trends in that category.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I've got two questions on YouTube for Sundar. First, this morning on the earnings call, WPP's CEO, Sir Martin Sorrell, noted that the company is being very responsive, I think were his words, to some of the recent concerns that we'd talked about earlier in the Q&A. We've also seen some official policy changes, things like that. I'd be interested, Sundar, to hear a little bit more about some of the softer outreach that you may be doing, thinking of Philipp Schindler's team, maybe the agency relations team, and how your people are reaching out and connecting with their clients, especially as you go into Brandcast?
And then the second follow-up on YouTube was, I'd be interested to hear your updated thoughts on the role of the YouTube Spaces. I think Ruth's prepared comments on CapEx mentioned some investments in production equipment. I don't know if that is related to that or something related to Cloud, but it does seem that the Spaces remain an important part of YouTube and continue to grow. And I'd love to hear an updated view on them. Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On the first part, (43:20) one of the things I've noticed is the depth of relationships we have with our advertisers was very evident to me as we went through this over the past few weeks. I would estimate – I think Philipp Schindler's team has probably made literally thousands and thousands of calls, in-person conversations, and I think that deep relationship is what allowed us to respond thoughtfully. And I think the feedback from our partners were very positive and constructive, and I think we are evolving overall to a better place. And so I think to me that shows the long-term investments you make in these relationships, et cetera, plays well at times like these. And Brandcast is again an important touch point, and the excitement ahead of Brandcast, both internally and from our partners, all has the right indications for us.
On YouTube on Spaces, I visited the YouTube Space. I took my family to the YouTube Space in New York, and we had a lot of fun. Our creators love these spaces. They are something we are thoughtfully building out. They have a good return on investment for us, but we are very thoughtful about it. And I don't think that's a major factor in any of the CapEx we talked about here.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Yeah, Exactly. In the CapEx, when I talked about production equipment, we were talking about machines, and that was the primary driver here. We're investing more machines given both our growing requirements and the higher cost of the new generation of machines and accelerators. So that will be more expensive in the short term, and we are continuing to build our inventory. But it does increase performance, and we believe reduce total cost of ownership in the longer term, so just to clarify that on CapEx.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay, great. Thank you both for the color.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. I'm not sure if this is for Sundar or Ruth, but a question about regulatory. You guys recently reached an agreement in Russia around the Android bundling issue, where you're going to provide options for other browsers and search engines and app stores when a new Android phone is activated. So I was just wondering if this is the right way to think about these kinds of disputes in other areas of the world, where you may be under some regulatory pressure around Android bundles, or if that was kind of a one-off, isolated agreement. Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
I think – without getting into specifics, I think when we deal with regulatory issues, I mean, the concerns vary differently depending on local laws and what the concerns are. I think in the case of Russia, I think there were some specific issues. And I'm glad we were able to work together with the regulatory agencies there, with our partners there, to come to a good solution. I'm not sure that's the right template. But as much as we are very committed to making sure we work with all the right agencies in all the countries we operate in, and I'm confident we'll get to a good place.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Great. Thank you. Sundar, ahead of this advertising conference I was thinking about Search innovation. And over the last four years, you've had an acceleration with PLAs, a really acceleration with the third ad link. And I'm just wondering, maybe you could talk about what excites you. Or do you think there's still a lot to go on Search monetization or coverage? And then from Ruth, obviously so many areas you can invest in. You could cut price on Cloud. You could really ramp up engineers in the core or Cloud. Just a lot you can do. And just how does the management team think about balancing profitability versus driving market share and long-term growth? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On Search, I continue to get surprised by the kind of things users reach out to us for and how that keeps evolving and changing. And with the Assistant now, too, just exposes a whole new surface area. And so I think there's a lot of innovation ahead. In terms of monetization, I think about it – it still looks like there is a lot of – for example, if you just look at retail, 90% of retail is still offline. So there are many, many secular trends like that, which we look at and we see a huge opportunity to help connect users to the information they are looking for. So, structurally, I do think we still have lots of both innovation and growth ahead for the long term, and that's how we think about it.
Maybe to Ruth on the second part?
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Yeah, and really actually building on that, to answer the second part of your question. When we look at the ongoing momentum that you've seen here in Sites revenue, it really does go to innovation. No one change tends to drive results, it's really the combined benefit of all that we're doing across the franchise, continuing to invest in the business and the benefits that we see there. And that's the way we look at it, is we have tremendous opportunity continuing in mobile search and in YouTube across the business there. And as we're looking at these newer opportunities, all that we're doing in Cloud, in hardware, YouTube subscription businesses, we analyze each one of those individually, working very closely with the leaders and the milestones that are established there.
We do very much across the business have an operating principle that too many resources and too few can lead to suboptimal decisions and execution. And so what we're looking at over a multiyear period is the pace of innovation that's appropriate, given the sizable opportunity. But the key point – and I've said it on so many different calls – is that we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we're excited about the growth opportunities, not just within Google but across Alphabet with all that we're doing in Other Bets. And so we're looking at these, again, individually, over a multiyear period, looking at milestones, and appropriately calibrating the pace of investment that is logical. And at the same time, we continue to have a focus on enhancing efficiencies where we can. But overall, as I keep saying, our main priority remains revenue and profit dollar growth.

Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC
Thanks. I have two for Sundar. The first is, now that you've launched YouTube TV, I wonder if you'd tell us about the advertising opportunity there. And then what are you going to do, given all the assets, to maximize an inventory for marketers? And then secondly, I wonder, with that focus on brand safety you hear now from agencies and the bigger marketers, what's going to be the long-term impact, do you think, to YouTube programmatic from a more focused view on finding the right places to advertise?
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On your first question about YouTube TV, we're just getting started. I think the product is really intended for the YouTube generation. It's really great to see a take on how to consume TV, which is mobile first for that generation. And I think – I've been using the product and enjoying it. And I think that gives – as (50:50) we rethink that experience and make it work better and scale it up, I think it's – your question is valid. The delivery of ads on TV has also not evolved at the same speed as the delivery of ads and media content on the Internet. So I think – we think we have a significant opportunity to improve their experience, and especially for advertisers to be able to think across all these surfaces. So I think there's a lot of opportunity, but I think we are very focused on the consumer experience first.
On your second question around longer-term impact, look, these types of issues are not new for us. Over the past many, many years, as we've built services, scaled it up on the ramp, (51:37) constantly things evolve. We adapt to it, be it from spam in email or how we do search ranking, and all the efforts we put into it. These are the classes of problems our engineers are really, really good at working. These are large-scale system problems, and especially with machine learning and AI, over time I think we can really put in the right systems in place. And our teams work very thoughtfully with the external ecosystem, with our advertisers, agencies, and partners. And I think that balance will help us get it right for the very long term.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet
Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue grew sequentially and year over year. I totally understand that mobile search is contributing meaningfully to the profit dollars, but as we look at the Sites TAC as a percentage, is there a quarter or is there a point in time looking forward where that sort of elevated TAC growth rate will anniversary or fall back into line with Sites revenue growth as a growth rate? Is there anything you can do to proactively manage that TAC growth?
And then for Sundar, on YouTube, as the competition out there for video content really intensifies, to what extent is YouTube providing more favorable economics to its content creators in order to ensure that YouTube remains the leading platform and, importantly, in a lot of cases, an exclusive platform for your most popular channels? Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
So on Sites TAC, as we've often discussed, and as you said in your question, there are a number of factors that affect Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue, and the primary driver has been the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC. The other factors include the mix of paid versus organic, as well as changes in partner, mix, or agreement terms. And when we look year over year, the primary driver of the increase is – very much to your question – the strength in mobile search. And we do expect Sites TAC to increase as a percentage of revenues. But, again, our focus continues to be on growing profit dollars. And I think the main point is we're very pleased to have a very strong business in a rapidly growing area. And that's benefiting our profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
And on YouTube, when I look at it from a content creator standpoint, I think there are a lot of factors which are working well. So, for example, when we recently invested in original shows, we find that like over half the time people spend watching originals is on their mobile phones. We find that creators who are featured in originals experience a significant boost in YouTube subscribers and watch time on their main channels as well, often from new fans. So all of this shows us that the enthusiasm which is there for the platform, how creators can do unique things which are different from what they can do on other platforms. And I think that's what gives us the differentiation here. And in these areas, we are just getting started, and so there's a lot more to come. And I think that will help us provide better economics for them, better engagement for them, and I think positions us well.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet
Thank you both.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Sundar, when we think about virtual reality and augmented reality, from your point of view, what are the key steps that are needed to see more mass market appeal and usage? And could you help quantify the amount of investment that you are willing to place in this area before you expect to see a payoff? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
So I think obviously you're seeing we are very happy with the progress we have seen with Daydream. Just like we built Android, we are good at building platforms and ecosystems, and I think we are taking the right first steps with VR there as well. When I broadly look at VR and AR, I think all of us clearly understand the potential, and technically we are making the breakthroughs that are needed. And all of it needs to converge, from a hardware, software, services standpoint, to a stage where it has mass-market appeal. And I think that is still some ways away.
The thing which gives me excitement is all these changes start happening with a set of early adopters and moves mainstream, and so we're engaging at that level with the early adopters. And that's where Daydream is working well. We are learning how to write great content on top of VR. YouTube, Google Earth VR, Tilt Brush – these are all great examples. So underlying technology wise, be it all the kinds of sensors and tracking you need to do, the machine learning and AI you need, things like voice recognition, everything – it's just a computing evolution, so everything we are investing today in machine learning and AI, as well as what we're doing in our computing platforms, transitions well. So I think we're already well-positioned to play this, and so I think we'll thoughtfully approach it. And we'll approach it more holistically.

Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thank you. I guess just as a follow-up to the question on voice interfaces and personal assistant, something that Larry also called out in his founder's letter. It appears there are more tests around monetization, including transactions and integration with Shopping Express. I wonder if there's a view internally now as to how best to make that transition in a voice-first world towards monetization, towards voice and less tech spend and video-centric? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
We are very focused, actually, on the consumer experience now, and it's a good question. And we've always had these questions, be it the early days of Search or when YouTube was first built out. How do I see (58:09) experiences created, like will YouTube ever make money? And so I think if you go and create these experiences in a way that works at scale for users, the monetization will follow. And obviously – and the models will be different than what we have today, but I think we are squarely focused right now on delivering a world-class experience through voice and through Assistant.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ellen West - Alphabet, Inc
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. While you've been waiting for the call to start, you've been listening to Ingrid Michaelson. In just a decade, she has released six albums, five of which have charted. The song you just heard, Celebrate, is from her latest release titled, ""It Doesn't Have To Make Sense"". Please check out her YouTube channel.
Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2015, filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website, located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you. Our revenue of $26.1 billion in the fourth quarter underscores the continued excellent performance of our businesses globally. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 24% in constant currency versus 4Q 2015, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison. Advertising revenue growth was driven by Mobile Search with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from hardware, Play and Cloud.
Our outline for today's call is first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I'll focus on year-over-year changes in our results. You can find quarterly comparisons in the earnings release. Second, I'll review the results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with a summary of the full-year results and our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenue was $26.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $202 million or $15 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenue grew 24% year-over-year.
Alphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenue was up 24% year-over-year to $12.7 billion. U.K. revenue was up 7% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, reflecting the continued weakness of the British pound relative to last year. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 21% year-over-year.
Rest of world revenue was up 24% versus last year to $11.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year-over-year. GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses; specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers including depreciation and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube as well as hardware.
The impact of our Q4 hardware launches is reflected in both revenues and cost of revenues. However, it's important to note the cost of revenues was also affected by approximately $320 million of one-time charges related to equipment and another adjustments, which were unrelated to hardware.
GAAP operating expenses were $8.8 billion in the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Year-on-year comparisons in part reflect the impact of the expenses from project milestones and Other Bets in 4Q 2015 that we discussed last year. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating margin was 25%. Non-GAAP operating income was $8.5 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 33%. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Headcount at the end of the quarter was just over 72,000, up 2,100 people from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as Cloud including the addition of employees from our Apigee acquisition.
Other income and expense was $218 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 22% for the fourth quarter reflecting the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete items affecting our U.S. rate. Our effective tax rate for the full year 2016 was 19%. Net income was $5.3 billion on a GAAP basis and $6.6 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.56 on a GAAP basis and $9.36 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $3.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.4 billion with free cash flow of $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $86.3 billion of which approximately $52 billion or 61% is held overseas.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $25.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $18 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Year-on-year growth reflects strength in Mobile Search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView including buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $4.4 billion, up 7% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob offset by the traditional network businesses.
Other revenue for Google was $3.4 billion, up 62% year-over-year with strong performance from each of hardware, Play and Cloud. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.
Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements. Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.8 billion or 22% of total advertising revenue and up 20% year-over-year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely Mobile Search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile which was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites which carries lower TAC. Operating income excluding SBC was $9.5 billion, up 19% versus last year for an operating margin of 37%. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 29% year-over-year.
Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7.9 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets, I'll cover results for the full year 2016 because it's most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon as discussed previously. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release.
For the full year 2016, Other Bets revenue was $809 million, up 82% versus 2015, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $2.9 billion for the full year 2016, a slight decline from 2015. Including the impact of SBC, the operating loss was $3.6 billion for the full year, an increase of 4% over 2015.
Other Bets accrued CapEx was $1.4 billion for the full year 2016, up 63% over 2015. Before I move to my conclusion, I'll quickly cover some specific changes to our past practices.
First, we are making changes to our non-GAAP reporting. SBC has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of all shareholders. Although it's not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results. Noncash stock-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits.
Second, we are shifting the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle for employees to the first quarter of every year. The next full year equity refresh will occur in the first quarter of 2018. Because the last full employee equity refresh occurred in the third quarter of 2016, we are providing employees with a one-time half grant in the first quarter of 2017. Overall, total SBC for 2017 will be roughly the same as it would have been had we maintained a Q3 refresh cycle. However, given the shift in refresh timing, there will not be the historical seasonal increase in SBC in Q3 and Q4. We do not plan any changes to our senior executives' equity refresh, which occurs every two years with an excellent plan for 2018.
Third, to hedge our non-U.S. dollar earnings, we are moving from using options-only to using primarily forwards. We believe they will be a more effective way to hedge earnings. We intend to continue to use options selectively.
We continue to believe that constant currency revenue growth provides the best insight into underlying trends by isolating the impact of currency movements on revenue. We will continue to provide constant currency results for consolidated revenues, as well as for revenues by geography. This will give you a view into the effects of currency movements on our revenue.
Turning now to our full-year 2016 performance and outlook. 2016 was simply a great year for us. Our extraordinarily talented employees worked very hard and successfully for our users around the globe. That commitment is reflected in the company's exceptional financial results. For the full year 2016, consolidated revenue grew 20% and excluding the impact of currency movements grew 24%. GAAP operating income was up 23%. This performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in Mobile Search, YouTube and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped.
Alongside these businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium and long-term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis, reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and Cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We're investing in our Cloud and hardware businesses as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years. We're also investing significantly in the machine learning capabilities and next-generation computing infrastructure that will propel Google's growth over the longer-term.
For our Other Bets, we continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution paths. A couple of our recent announcements demonstrate our approach here.
First, in December, Waymo graduated into a standalone business within Other Bets. We did this because Waymo achieved agreed thresholds on the path to commercialization in its technical and business model. Waymo continues to excel at safety, has begun putting its new Chrysler Pacifica minivans on the road and is continuing to drive down hardware costs.
Nest delivered an outstanding performance this holiday season with sales of key products more than doubling over the two weeks including Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
And just this morning, Verily announced that Temasek has agreed to invest $800 million for a minority stake in the company. Temasek's extensive experience with life sciences and healthcare companies and deep understanding of Asian markets make it a valuable long-term partner for Verily.
The internal transparency we've provided to our business leaders across the Other Bets and Google is helping us to allocate resources more thoughtfully across the opportunities that we see. We remain committed to managing for long-term revenue and EPS growth for dollars rather than margin targets, while exercising careful stewardship over the amounts and pace of investment.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Ruth. 2016 was a great year for Google, and 2017 is shaping up to be even more exciting. This quarter was about the business firing on all cylinders and terrific progress across Google's newer areas of investment.
Today, I'm going to talk about three things. First, the key trend powering Google today, machine learning and how it's improving our products and creating lots of opportunities. In particular, how it's underpinning our core mission of providing access to information for everyone, especially via the Google Assistant, which is off to a great start.
Second, I want to talk about three of our biggest bets, YouTube, Cloud and hardware, where we are making great progress. And third, I'll discuss the great trends we are seeing across the platforms; our vibrant computing platforms, Android, Chrome and Daydream, strong momentum in Google Play, as well as our thriving advertising platform.
First, machine learning and access to information. As I've shared before, computing is moving from a mobile-first to AI-first with more universal ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning. 2016 was the year that this became central to who we are as a company and the products that we built. We had more than 350 launches powered by machine learning across areas like search, maps, messaging and Google Play.
You've heard lots of these examples; easier e-mail replies and inbox, better YouTube recommendations, the incredible cameras on our Pixel phones, and smarter bidding for advertisers in AdWords.
A centerpiece of our machine learning efforts is the Google Assistant which allows users to have a natural conversation with Google to help them get things done across their experience. It's off to a great start. You can easily ask it to navigate home, tell you about your schedule for the day, or even play trivia. We reached a milestone last month with our announcement of the Assistant developer platform called Actions on Google. It gives developers like Uber, SongPop and Headspace the opportunity to build conversation actions for Google Home, and we'll expand it even further this year. The Assistant is baked into our smart messaging app, Allo, which we expanded this quarter in languages like Hindi, Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese.
This quarter, using neural machine translation, we have improved our translation ability more in one single leap than all our improvements over the last 10 years combined. We'll be rolling neural machine translation out across to more than 100 languages available in Google Translate in 2017 and also for all of our Cloud customers through the Google Cloud Translation API.
And Google Photos, which as you know has machine learning at its heart, continues to grow in popularity. Last quarter, we launched PhotoScan, which helps you digitize all of those old printed photos that are probably stored in a shoebox in your closet, to keep them safe, organized and shareable. In February, we are hosting a summit where our machine learning team and other experts will discuss the future of the TensorFlow open-source initiative and share some of their latest demos.
Now, I want to spend some time talking about three big bets, YouTube, Cloud and hardware. First, YouTube, which remains the premier destination for online video globally and is seeing tremendous growth. At the heart of YouTube's success is its booming community of creators. Every single day, over 1,000 creators reached the milestone of having 1,000 channel subscribers. We are focused on two main areas of investment. First, creating the best video experience that's fast, personalized, searchable, and that just works. We have rolled out many new features to the platform like 360-degree videos, mobile live streams, and support for videos and virtual reality. In regions with limited connectivity, we introduced YouTube Go, which has transparency and control of data usage.
Second, we are focused on delivering content that gives fans exactly what they want through offerings like YouTube Music, YouTube Kids and YouTube Red. We have 27 originals, pairing some of the most popular YouTube creators with the biggest directors and producers in Hollywood. One of our new originals called This Is Everything, Gigi Gorgeous about the courageous journey of a transgender YouTube star, officially premiered at Sundance just a few days ago. The popularity of this original content has been successful in driving new subscribers and retaining existing ones, and we'll do more in 2017.
Second, our Cloud business is on a terrific upswing. In 2016, we made huge strides building out our product offerings across all areas of Google Cloud Platform or GCP. We routinely hear from customers that we have now moved well beyond table stakes, and we have truly differentiated offerings in four key areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development, and the ability to create connected business platforms, leveraging our recent acquisition of Apigee. Our product advancements across all of GCP, in addition to our increased focus on how we work with the enterprise customers, have enabled us to accelerate growth with new Fortune 2000 customers while also inspiring our current customers to substantially expand their use of GCP.
We have also enjoyed strong growth with G Suite, our cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications. G Suite achieved a significant new customer milestone last quarter. More than 3 million paying businesses are now using G Suite to collaborate smartly and securely in the cloud. Our increased success with enterprise customers relates to the unparalleled security and data protection we can provide by offering an entirely cloud-based solution that enables an extremely strong level of production. For both GCP and G Suite, expanding our partner ecosystem continues to be a big focus. And last quarter, the team announced new alliances including Intel, Improbable, Slack, Pivotal and Red Hat. Our customers and partners are appreciating Google Cloud's dramatically accelerated pace of product rollout, as well as our responsiveness to both their needs and aspirations. We look forward to showcasing customers, partners and all of Google Cloud at our next annual Next user conference in March.
Third, hardware. We introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel phone, which featured a Google Assistant built in. We are thrilled with the reception as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season. In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning. We are committed to this for the long-term as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people. The early signs are promising and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully. We will also continue working closely with our ecosystem partners to create the best experiences for our users.
So those are three of our biggest bets. We are also continuing to push the platforms that are powering our business and our partners' businesses. First, our computing platforms; and second, our advertising platforms. Building powerful open platforms has always been core to Google and our platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream are creating more innovation, more choice for users and more opportunities for partners. This was on full display at the CES show. There we saw partners like NVIDIA and AirTV introduce new media players based on Android TV. And Casio and New Balance shared their latest Android Wear smartwatches.
We also worked closely with Samsung on a new generation of Chromebooks called the Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus, which are getting great buzz. And in VR, we recently worked with partners like Huawei and ASUS and others to introduce even more new Daydream-ready devices. CES is just a start and there's a lot more coming from our great partners across these platforms in 2017, and we'll continue working hand-in-hand with them to provide the best experiences for our users.
We're also investing in ways to help developers succeed using our platforms. Last week, we announced that we are acquiring the Fabric mobile app development platform. This will work alongside our Firebase platform to help developers build better apps and grow their businesses. Since we launched Firebase at I/O, developers have created over 1 million Firebase projects. That's incredible momentum. Google Play helps bring our platforms to life on mobile and beyond, and it's experiencing great momentum. As a piece of trivia, do you know what 2016's top movie was on Google Play? I'll provide the answer in a second.
Play had a great quarter with continued growth in our top markets, as well as in emerging markets where user spend grew by more than 70% year-over-year in countries like India, Mexico, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. As the content hub across our growing platforms, the Play team is working hard to help users get the most out of their devices through apps, games and premium content.
In Q4, the Play Store launched on Daydream, Android apps became available on Chromebooks and we announced that the Play Store will soon be coming to Android Wear. The platform is also benefiting significantly from machine learning. We recently introduced a new Google Play music experience that makes music streaming smarter and easier to use with better recommendations and playlists. And the answer to my trivia question, the top movie in 2016 was Deadpool.
Lastly, I quickly touch on the highlights across our growing advertising businesses. I'm so pleased with the terrific partnerships we have continued to grow this year. We work incredibly closely and deeply with agencies, marketers and publishers worldwide. These relationships owe a lot to the hard work of our fantastic business teams around the world. Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play are where people turn when they are actively engaged. They are the primetime in the mobile era.
We had another successful holiday season where we saw two clear trends. First, this was the year that mobile shopping went truly mainstream, with shoppers using phones as their door to the store to locate nearby retailers, find promotions and comparison-shopped. We recently introduced promoted places in Google Maps, helping advertisers stand out with branded location icons, showing promotions and live updates of popular times right when someone's looking for it.
Gap Inc is one example of a company that understands the importance of connecting with consumers on mobile devices. In December, they increased their U.S. mobile search ad spend with us; and as a result, they saw about four times the mapped mobile traffic to their U.S. e-commerce sites compared to December of last year.
Second, we saw this season that measurement really matters, and advertisers want reliable ways of understanding where their sales and traffic are coming from and how their campaigns are working. We saw increased use of our popular store visits technology over the holiday shopping season, helping businesses understand how online ads bring customers into their physical stores. In less than two years, store visits have helped advertisers measure over 3 billion store visits globally.
Now, turning to our thriving video ads business, led by YouTube. Marketers are seeing terrific success here. Air France used YouTube's TrueView video ads in order to reach valuable business travelers and new customers around the world. By showing engaging videos, highlighting the unique experiences of Air France, they saw more than 100 million views throughout the campaign.
Turner Sports partnered with YouTube and DoubleClick for NBA opening night to try a new way to reach fans for the start of the season. We help them deliver real-time video ads with behind the scenes pregame footage uploaded immediately into a YouTube TrueView ad campaign. Thanks to the campaign, they were able to reach 19 million more people across the web with 17% left in ad recall. Speaking of DoubleClick, many news publishers who are using our Accelerated Mobile Pages are now plugging into our Ad Exchange to drive revenue. We are thrilled that most publishers are getting higher click-through rates and effective CPMs with the AMP pages.
Before I end, I want to highlight one area that I'm really proud of that Google is truly leading the way. As you know, our data centers from Oklahoma to Chile, to Finland enable our services to be blazing fast and they are what make it possible for Google Photos to offer unlimited storage. But to do all this, they use lots of energy. In 2012, we set the long-term goal to reach 100% renewable energy for our operations. In 2015, we procured enough renewable energy to cover 44% of our total and in 2016 we increased it to more than 50%. I'm really proud that we'll reach 100% renewable energy for global operations in 2017. This is great for the environment and with renewable energy costs declining, it's a huge win for our business results too.
With that, I want to thank the Googlers around the world who help make this another exciting quarter. Over to you, Ruth.

And our first question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you. I had a question for Sundar. I was wondering, I wanted to focus on the cloud business. When we speak with CIOs about GCP, they highlight in many cases the need for Google to improve upon its enterprise sales strategy. I'm just wondering if you could share with us the changes you've been making in that organization and the goals that you have for the cloud business for 2017.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks, Heather. As I said in my opening remarks, I do think we have seen tremendous momentum at our partnerships team and how we are approaching. There are a lot of new alliances which I talked about. So now we have teams dedicated to partnering with GSIs and we have a team focused on technology partnerships too. On the GSI front, we announced a new alliance with Accenture last September to create industry solutions for a number of industries including retail. So for me, I think, overall, everywhere I look at we are establishing a world-class enterprise team. Partnerships has been a big focus and I've seen progress there.
I think as I said in my remarks, overall, 2017 I expect to have a lot of momentum because we have moved well beyond the table stakes. Now, we are really competing on areas which we think we have differentiation. I talked about data analytics and machine learning, security and so on. So I think we are well-positioned. The momentum when we look at the numbers internally and as well as the traction we see in competitive situations, I definitely think we are going to have a great year and hopefully in the next conference coming up, Diane and team will share a lot more details.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe first for Sundar. Now that you have this breadth of device ecosystem out there into the marketplace, wanted to know if we get a little bit more color around what your learnings are about the adoption of the device ecosystem, how you're thinking about the go-to-market strategy over the medium to long-term and how we might see sort of an evolution across operating systems? And if I can, maybe one for Ruth, you called out a one-time charge in – or one-time impact on the number in the quarter. I wanted to get a little more granularity about what went into that one-time expense so we could just sort of factor that into the financials. Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Hey, Eric. I'm assuming when you said the device ecosystem you're talking about how our platforms are working at scale. The thing which I get excited about is computing is increasingly moving rather than just one device which is a dedicated computing device to being there for users in their context and you'll see computing increasingly embedded in many things, and we have a comprehensive strategy. We do want – we invest in it for the long run. We're improving our computing experiences with machine learning. We expect to be there for users across a device ecosystem, and we're also building things like Google Play to work across all of this so that users can have one coherent experience. I think we see great momentum both across our partner ecosystem, as well as pushing the cutting edge of the experience which is what we strive to do with our own hardware devices. And so I think the end-to-end strategy is working well for us.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And in terms of, you noted, the one-time item, there are really two that I'm actually going to call out. One was in cost of revenues, I noted that equipment costs were elevated by some one-time charges, and so there was some pressure there. And then the other item that I noted was with respect to our tax rate. I noted that there was slightly elevated tax rate this quarter. It's always affected by the geographic mix of results but we did have a discrete item that affected the U.S. tax rate to make that clear.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Two questions, please. Again, Ruth, on that $320 million one-time charge, is there any more detail you can provide on that? It seems like a relatively sizable amount.
And then, Sundar, if you could talk a little bit about Voice Search, particularly in the home and in the car, and the importance of getting devices out in the marketplace? And the challenge I'll throw to you is, it looks to me like Google devices are being outsold ten-to-one or something like that in most – in a lot of homes, and it's immaterial now, but it could see in five years that there's is a new Voice Search interaction interface and it's not Google in the home. That could be a real challenge for the company. Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
So, on the first one trying to be helpful in giving you dimension and impact on cost of sales, but really not much more to add there. I think the other point is that you're thinking about the hardware business. It was gross margin positive. There were just some other variables in there.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
And, Mark, on Voice Search, we are really excited about it. I think it's a very natural way for users to interact. We think it will be one mode. Users will have many different base by which they interact with computing. And for voice, as you pointed out, we expect voice to work across many different contexts. So we are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars, and trying to drive that ecosystem that way, and we want Google to be there for users when they need it. And even with Google Home, we just launched it in Q4. We had a very strong quarter there, and we are going to invest a lot in it over 2017. It's very early days. When I look at what it would take to Voice Search well, our years of progress we have done in areas like natural language processing comes into play, and I think there's a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. And this is the core area where we've invested in for the very long term, and so I feel very comfortable about how this will play out in the future.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC

Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Ruth, you commented on YouTube and addressed some of the non-advertising revenue streams. I was just hoping you could elaborate there a little bit what the goals would be there for your users.
And then just to follow up on Mark's question on Voice Search, I understand, Sundar, it's early, but how do you think about the challenges and opportunities from a monetization perspective in Voice? Thanks.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
So on the first question in terms of YouTube, Sundar elaborated on my opening comments. We're really pleased with the ongoing strength we have there. We talked about on prior calls. It's largely driven by Video, primarily TrueView with a strong contribution from DoubleClick Bid Manager, and we are continuing to invest significantly in the business given the importance of supporting the ecosystem of content creators through partner payments, marketing, YouTube Originals, YouTube Spaces. We're broadening the platform. We're investing in the requisite infrastructure given machines and bandwidth required, and Sundar elaborated on some of the upside we see there on the non-ad side.
And really the point I was trying to stress consistent with Sundar's comments is, we've got the non-ads momentum here on the YouTube side, and we're also seeing tremendous momentum with cloud, which we're excited about, and the hardware and investing behind those. So those continue to build out the revenue streams as we're looking in the near to medium to long term.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
And, Doug, I mean, just like Mark's question on Voice Search, I would encourage you to think about it as from a user standpoint, they are looking for information, looking to get things done. The voice queries are one part of the total journey they are on. So when we think about something like the Google Assistant, we think about it as an ongoing conversation with our users across different contexts. So they may ask a question on voice, later when they pick up their phone, they want continuity, so we think of this as an end-to-end thing. And all of this means users engage more with us, more with computing and look for more information, and I think the trends we see are positive. So we think about it from a long-term perspective, and so I see more opportunity than challenge when I think about Voice Search.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much. Another one on YouTube, if I could. Would it be possible to get any sort of metrics around YouTube Red and how the subscription business has been progressing, realizing you're not going to be providing that every quarter but that you do occasionally give us some sort of benchmarks in the market? Thanks so much.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Well, at this point, we've launched in five countries. We're pleased with the early success and it's still early days, it takes a while to build a subscription business here. And I'll pass it to Sundar for additional commentary.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Look, I mean, I think – I would think about it as, we are investing a lot in developing this premium experience in a way of YouTube Brand, YouTube Music, and we do offer it across Google Play Music as well. You will see us invest more, more countries, more original content, and we'll bring together the experiences we have over the course of this year. So it's even more compelling for users. But we are seeing tractions with the rate of signups. We're not disclosing specific numbers, but I'm excited at the progress there.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, just to go back to YouTube, I appreciate the color around the content. I'd be curious to hear about how you think philosophically about partnering with more premium content players to maybe drive even higher engagement and an even better YouTube experience.
And then the second one, if you kind of step back in your Mobile Search business and the verticals, the innovation you've had at retail and travel with Shopping and Hotel Finder, I guess I'd be curious to hear about where you see the biggest potential for more improvements in certain verticals for an even more relevant and higher search result experience over the next years. Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On your first question, look, I mean, we think of YouTube again as an ecosystem. We are trying to connect creators with users, form a community. And so, we work hard to bring more premium content. We already work with TV networks and their individual shows, whether it's a late-night show like James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, afternoon shows like Ellen, sports programming like NBA and NFL. For example, sports is one of the most popular verticals. We have hundreds of sports partnership in place, and so we'll continue to invest that way and drive the premium content there.
On the second one, we do look at the end-to-end experience, look at what are the kinds of tasks which users are trying to get done. Mobile raises the bar if you want to provide those deeper experiences for users. And so, I generally think local is a big area. We have strong assets there with Maps, and so we think about how we can improve the local experience a lot more for users. So for example, within local areas like dining, we work closely with our partners to make that better. So we get it at a pretty granular level and we try to hit all the areas. And so, I think you'll see progress in all these areas over the next few years.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, great. Thanks.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open.
Anthony DiClemente, CFA - Nomura Instinet
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Yeah, just on YouTube, I'd love to hear about the pricing and then also about AdMob (44:47). So, is there anything you could highlight on ad format? And specifically, we noticed that recently you're enabling marketers to target YouTube ads based on search, and so I just want to hear about that strategy. And maybe relatedly, the recently announced non-skippable YouTube ads format. Would love to kind of hear about that. Thanks for taking my questions.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Look, overall, I would say there's been a – been very pleased with how the team has been driving innovation in ad formats and ad experiences. I think video advertising is in its very early days. We see whenever we (45:32) innovation phase, and advertiser response to all these new formats has been really positive. So for example a bumper ads are six second video format that we launched. It's already being used by thousands of accounts, including major brands like Universal Pictures and Netflix.
On your question around how we think about the experience across screens, it's really important to understand users consume YouTube across screens, and so they experience consistent experience. And similarly, from an advertising standpoint, we want that to be thoughtful for users, more relevant across screens as well. And so that's the context in which we do this. We give users control over that experience. But I do think as part of these changes, advertisers can get more detailed insights from their YouTube campaigns across devices so they can better understand the impact of their marketing campaigns. So I think it's early days, but I think it's the right direction, and I think we will see good traction from it.
Anthony DiClemente, CFA - Nomura Instinet

Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of Moffett. Your line is now open.
Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC
Thanks. I have two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, just picking on the YouTube questions, there was a report that YouTube and CBS had agreed on an agreement to distribute CBS on YouTube. Can you talk a bit if that has actually happened? And if so, what's the opportunity to partner with networks and how will that evolve over time?
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Look, I can't comment on any specific discussions, but I said a little bit earlier we are constantly working with partners across these areas. We work very closely with TV networks on their individual shows. It's a big part of the YouTube experience. And so you will see us work hard to make these partnerships deeper and bring more content to our users. So maybe I'll leave it at that.
Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC
Okay. And then for Ruth, you mentioned programmatic drove the network members' revenue growth this quarter. If you look at fourth quarter this year and last year, there seems to be an acceleration in Q4 and then it comes back. I wonder what's happening seasonally to that revenue line that drives fourth quarter up so much.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Well, as we've talked about on prior calls, there are obviously a number of businesses within the network line, and a number of things went right this quarter. I wouldn't extrapolate from it. As you know, there can be some seasonality, and Q1 is typically lower than the fourth quarter.
I think the main point is that the programmatic business continues to be a strong contributor with significant growth reflecting the ongoing advertiser adoption just given the overall efficiency of programmatic and improved targeting and the benefit of inventory growth. And so the story, it's pretty much unchanged. We continue to see the growth in programmatic offset by declines in the more traditional businesses. And when you're looking at the quarter-over-quarter, we are continuing to see things like the impact of policy changes and timing of product launches. But I just think that there were a number of things that went well this quarter. Q3 was a bit lighter so that's been flatter quarter-over-quarter comparison, but I wouldn't extrapolate from this.
Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC
Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Wondering, Sundar, if you can just give us a sense on the Pixel phone hardware opportunity to kind of build direct mobile distribution and capture hardware margin, and how you think about that versus the potential disruption that having your own handset at a bigger scale could cause in the Android ecosystem? Do you think this is something that could get meaningful market share without disrupting the ecosystem?
And then a second follow-up related to this would be on the Pixel phones with Google Assistant having been built uniquely into the core of the experience, is there anything you're learning as the usage of that increases? Is it driving a step-function, increasing engagement with the hardware/software integration? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
Look, I mean, we are in the early days. I think it's really important when you work on a platform you have to drive it forward as we've always done by putting out the state-of-the-art and I think it especially gets important in the vision we have for computing where users are going to use it across many different contexts. And so to do that end-to-end experience, it spans devices. So I think it's important for us to work at the intersection of hardware, software and services and so that's how we think about it. And I think we invest a lot more in our ecosystem and I mentioned earlier, I'm incredibly excited at the lineup we have for this year from our partners. So we do both and we are very thoughtful about it. I think the scale at which we are doing it shows it's working and I'm confident we'll be able to strike that balance well.
In terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how search works, I think definitely it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure it's working better for users. Our thesis is that as we make it easier for users to have Google at their fingertips across what they are doing and including many modes whether they are typing or asking Google a question, we find that it overall benefits. And so it will be a long-term trend but I think our earlier studies (51:44) show that our intuition is right there and so we'll continue approaching it that way.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Thank you. So, Sundar, you called out Google Play growth in emerging markets in your prepared remarks. So I thought from a revenue size standpoint it would be one of the big bets you would highlight but – so I'm wondering how you view your own Instant Apps as well as the products or their operators to let consumers try apps either in a messenger product or on an HTML5 environment? Do these innovations present an opportunity or a challenge for you at the Play franchise?
And secondarily, it seems that the recurring theme in your prepared remarks is how AI is making the consumer products better. Is there anything you can share with us as to how it may be making monetization better? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
So, on Google Play, for me what makes it work well is just with the vision of computing we have been talking about how it works across contexts. You need an ecosystem. You need an apps and services ecosystem to work cohesively across all of this and that's what I like about how we are approaching Google Play and you saw us this quarter – see Google Play work beyond Android phones. They're coming to Chromebooks. They work in Daydream, they work in Android Wear and so it's an end-to-end thing which works well. And that's the most important thing so that as a user, you know whether you're engaging with a game or a TV show that you can reliably get it across your computing experiences. And we'll adapt and I think we will drive innovation simply to go where what's right for users and developers and so be it Instant Apps or driving better HTML5 experiences. We invest in all that and I think we'll move it all forward.
On your second question about how machine learning and AI is improving our monetization, it definitely, I mean, just like we had many, many launches last year which involve machine learning being incorporated across Google including our monetization products. Our monetization teams at Google have always been at the cutting edge of what I would call as machine learning techniques from early days on. And so they are doing it. It is early days now but I think we already have really new insights and so we'll bake it in over the course of the year.

Hi. Just maybe another question on YouTube. Can you expound a decision this quarter to remove third-party cookie and Pixel activity? It looks as though you're favoring something much more identity-based and maybe you could just think through the – or explain a bit about the impetus there and maybe the trade-offs for marketers, that would be great. Thank you very much.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
I spoke about it a bit earlier, but I think it's important that we evolve all of this from a user-centric standpoint, and users have an identity, they have preferences. And so for example, think about it from a user standpoint. If they don't like one particular ad or they don't want to see an ad from a particular advertiser. They want it to work across their experience, across their cross-device experience. So we think about it that way, and so we are working towards a long-term experience that's right for users and which I think will make sense for advertisers reaching users too. So I think we are evolving it jointly and thoughtfully, giving users control. And I think that's the right way to approach it over time.

Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. I'd like to ask first a question about ad coverage and click rates. Maybe just your thoughts on potential to increase ad coverage now that you have a fourth link. Is there still room to help ad clicks with coverage increases? And just as you think out to this year, how do you feel about the innovation pipeline in ads? Do you think there's a lot more you can still do in Search?
And then two, housekeeping for you, Ruth. Maybe you could just let us know what kind of equipment was written off so we can think about how recurring that might be, and any comment on the buyback activity in the quarter? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.
On our monetization efforts, our teams always have been very thoughtful about planning not just for the short-term but planning for the long-term. We don't start the year thinking our plan is to increase ad coverage or something like that, right? We have many experiments in the pipeline. We see how user behavior is evolving and in conjunction with that, we evolve our ad experience. So for example, as people use mobile, scroll more, it's to track the user behavior changes, and we adapt to that in a very, very disciplined way.
So last year, you saw us maybe increase coverage in a certain way. For example, in desktop, we removed ads on the right-hand side, and so we take a very holistic approach to these things. For me, I do think we have a lot of headroom ahead. I still look at where most of transactions happen and how that secular transformation is underway, and so I think we see we have a lot more headroom left. And Ruth, I'll pass...
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And – yeah, in terms of your second question, really not much more to add on the first part. In terms of the buyback, we weren't able to commence it in the fourth quarter due to trading restrictions but we do look forward to getting back into the market.

And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Ellen (2:06).
Our revenue of $22.5 billion in the third quarter underscores the terrific performance of our businesses globally. For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 23% in constant currency versus last year, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison. Once again, the primary driver was Mobile Search, with ongoing strength in YouTube and important contributions from programmatic advertising and Play.
I'm going to present to you in the following order. First, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, total revenue was $22.5 billion, up 20% year over year and up 4% sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $196 million or $91 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23% year over year and increased 5% sequentially.
Alphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenue was up 22% year over year to $10.6 billion. UK revenue was up 5% year over year to $1.9 billion, reflecting the meaningful impact of the decline in the British pound relative to last year. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 18% year over year. Rest-of-world revenue was up 22% versus last year to $9.9 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 25% year over year.
GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.5 billion, up 30% year over year. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.2 billion, up 29% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
GAAP operating expenses were $8 billion in the quarter, up 15% year over year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.5 billion, up 13% year over year.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.8 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was $7.6 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 34%.
Stock-based compensation [SBC] totaled $1.9 billion, up 30% year over year and up 24% sequentially, primarily reflecting the step-up from our annual equity refresh for employees at the start of Q3.
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 69,953, up 3,378 people from last quarter. Headcount growth is typically seasonally highest in the third quarter as new graduates join. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud.
Other income and expense was $278 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 16%.
Net income was $5.1 billion on a GAAP basis and $6.3 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.25 on a GAAP basis and $9.06 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.6 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $9.8 billion, with free cash flow of $7.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $83.1 billion, of which approximately $50 billion or 60% is held overseas.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $22.3 billion, up 20% year over year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $16.1 billion in the quarter, up 23% year over year and up 4% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects strength in Mobile Search. We continue to have decent growth from desktop and tablet search.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 1% year on year and flat sequentially, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob, offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue for Google was $2.4 billion, up 39% year over year and up 12% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by Play and Cloud.
Finally, we provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements.
Total traffic acquisition costs [TAC] were $4.2 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 17% year over year and up 5% sequentially. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely Mobile Search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up slightly sequentially as a result of higher TAC for Mobile Search offsetting the benefits of a revenue mix shift from network to Sites.
Operating income excluding SBC was $8.4 billion, up 19% versus last year, for an operating margin of 38%. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 28% year over year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.8 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 30%. CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets, as we said previously, we think it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons. First, the Other Bets are early-stage. Second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. And finally, they may be impacted by one-time items like partnership deals.
For the third quarter, Other Bets revenue was $197 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $665 million in the third quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $865 million. Other Bets CapEx was $324 million in Q3, primarily reflecting ongoing investments in our Fiber business.
I'd like to close with a few observations on our progress since the creation of Alphabet just over a year ago as well as a review of our key themes. As we've frequently noted, our move to Alphabet was motivated by our belief that revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas. Long-term success requires a commitment to making bets, putting the right talent and resources behind those bets, and remaining flexible and dynamic as we pursue them. We believe our structure provides the transparency and oversight needed to make smart choices about our investment opportunities both within Google and across Other Bets.
As we reach for moon shots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way and that some efforts will be more successful than others. Over the past year, for example, you've seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas while repositioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future.
Looking ahead, first regarding revenue, our revenue growth reflects our sustained investment in innovation. Within Google, this relentless focus has led to innovations across our advertising platforms that have driven continued strong growth on a very large base, while at the same time we're building new businesses to serve as sources of future revenue growth. Most notably, Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business as well as the enormous opportunity in this area. And earlier this month, we launched a new line of hardware devices that, for the first time, brings consumers the best of Google through both hardware and software developed by Google.
As discussed previously, because most of our Other Bets are pre-revenue, the Other Bets revenue line provides only partial insight regarding our progress, which we aim to supplement with insight regarding product progress. For example, at Nest, product innovations and improvements, including the new outdoor version of the Nest Cam, are leading to increased consumer adoption of its suite of products for the home. Our self-driving car team is making terrific progress in transforming mobility, with our fleet of test cars recently passing the 2 million-mile mark of autonomous driving. We are now testing our cars in four cities, enabling us to experience varied weather and driving conditions.
Second, as to expenses, as I mentioned last quarter, there are a number of factors driving higher TAC in both our Sites and network businesses, and those factors persisted in the third quarter. The shift to mobile in Q3 remained the largest driver of the increase in Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue. We expect Sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of Sites revenue. The growth in network TAC in Q3 was due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate, a trend we expect to continue. Furthermore, with respect to Google's operating expenses, we remain committed to investing in the compelling opportunities we've identified.
Turning to Other Bets, we're building out these businesses systematically and thoughtfully, investing commensurate with requirements given the opportunities we see.
Before moving on from expenses, one reminder regarding the fourth quarter; as discussed in prior years, our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season. Relative to last year, we have an expanded portfolio of hardware products, and therefore expect marketing costs to increase in the fourth quarter to support the line.
Third regarding CapEx, at Google the team continues to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our Fiber investment remains the primary driver.
Fourth, our balance sheet; our balance sheet remains a powerful tool reflecting the strength of our cash flow and thereby giving us the ability to invest aggressively to support our long-term growth. Our primary focus is just that, investing in the breadth of opportunities across Alphabet. As discussed previously, our capital allocation framework begins with our outlook for the businesses, including a sensitivity analysis regarding potential CapEx and M&A, as well as a view regarding working capital and a prudent liquidity buffer. This framework further considers complementary uses such as the share repurchase. As announced today our board has authorized us to commence a repurchase of our Class C capital stock of up to $7,019,340,976.83.
In conclusion, in the third quarter we again delivered strong revenue growth while broadening our portfolio of products and services. Thanks to all of our colleagues around the globe for their ingenuity and passion for pushing the frontier.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
Thanks, Ruth.
I don't think I can remember a busier time in Google's history than the past few months. We introduced the world to the Google Assistant, powered by our state-of-the-art machine learning technology. We unveiled a beautiful lineup of new hardware devices, including Google Home and the Pixel phone, which is getting great reviews. We launched a new messaging app, Allo, and a new video chat app, Duo. It's been an incredible quarter. Through it all, we are laser-focused on the priorities I outlined earlier this year, and in the next few minutes I'll quickly go through our progress this past quarter.
We feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing. This new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and the cloud. This transition is as significant as the move over the last decade from desktops to mobile devices.
As we've rolled out products like the Google Assistant, Pixel, Google Home, and Allo, we have gotten a glimpse of that future. And with our growing cloud business, we are helping our enterprise customers take advantage of this new era of computing as well. Today I want to walk through our progress across Google's key focus areas and the success of our growing advertising business.
First, making knowledge and information accessible to everyone, we have long aimed to help people find the information that they want right when they need it and sometimes even before they think to ask for it. We reached an important milestone in that journey this quarter with the launch of the Google Assistant, which allows you to type or talk with Google in a natural conversational way to help you get things done regardless of the device you're using. We first introduced it in our smart messaging app, Allo, which lets you chat with the Assistant. You can even add it to a group conversation to help you and your friends decide where to go for dinner. Early adoption of Allo and Duo has been great and has exceeded our expectations.
And the Assistant is core to the Pixel phone and Google Home. With Google Home, you can ask the Assistant to cast a song to your living room speaker or turn on the lights in your kitchen. And with Pixel, by simply holding the home button, you can ask the Assistant to send a text to your mom or pull up pictures of your cat in Google Photos.
I hope you all get to try them out soon. The Assistant is simple, easy to use, and it is just the beginning. It's going to get so much better. We are excited to bring new features to you across more of your contacts soon.
The Assistant all possible thanks to our years of investments in computer science and machine learning. Our knowledge graph now understands over 70 billion facts about people, places, and things in the real world. And just last month, we announced our latest research on neural nets, which has given us a huge leap in translation quality. This breakthrough will help us provide even more accurate translations for people around the world.
And before I finish talking about access to information, I want to highlight the important work that our teams are doing to help American voters stay informed about the upcoming election. We've launched improved search tools to help voters get registered, find key deadlines and learn how to vote early or by mail. We launched these in both English and Spanish. I don't speak Spanish, but I checked Google Translate, and I wanted to remind everyone, no se olviden de votar. [Don't forget to vote.]
Second, moving to our efforts to bring more content to more places, key to making information accessible is helping people find more great content across platforms like the web, YouTube, and Google Play. Just recently, one of our key efforts to make the mobile web faster, the open-source Project AMP [Accelerated Mobile Pages] celebrated its first birthday. It's being embraced by a very broad range of publishers and sites around the world, covering more than 700,000 domains. One example, tens of millions of WordPress sites now have AMP pages with page load speeds up to 90% faster than normal in some cases. We are also working on an initiative called AMP for Ads, a new approach to creating and selling ads with speed at the heart of the experience.
On YouTube, we continue to invest in bringing engaging content to the platform. We worked with many news organizations to livestream all three U.S. presidential debates, and we saw record-breaking interest from the YouTube community. In fact, the three debates ranked as the three most viewed political live streams of all time on YouTube, with over 8.5 million hours watched live, a 5X increase from the 2012 debates. Elections-related searches on YouTube are also at an all-time high, with searches for U.S. election content up almost 550% compared to this time in the last election.
And YouTube originals like the recently released Single by 30 remain incredibly popular and continue to drive subscriptions for the YouTube brand.
And in Google Play, earlier this summer we introduced Family Library, a way for up to six family members to share app, game, movie, TV show, or book purchases.
Third, powerful computing platforms and hardware; we have long been committed to building powerful computing platforms like Android, Chrome, and now Daydream in VR, so that people can have great experiences regardless of their device.
Taking a step back, we have always believed that an open, horizontal, free platform like Android breeds more innovation, more options for users, and better business models for partners. We open-source our code, we build the most open APIs possible, and we work to create a sustainable open ecosystem. With over 4,000 distinct Android devices, we are really proud of how so many partners are having success on the platform.
This quarter we began rolling out our newest update on Android called Nougat and shared that we are bringing Android apps to Chromebooks. We can't wait to see all of the incredible experiences that developers will build on Daydream, our newest platform for high-quality virtual reality experiences via smartphones.
We also think there's an opportunity for us to more deeply integrate software and hardware together to deliver great experiences that we hope will also contribute to future innovation and development of the ecosystem.
Earlier this month, we launched a family of hardware products, made by Google, which in addition to the Google Pixel and Google Home, include: the Daydream View headset and controller; our premium TV streaming device, Chromecast Ultra; and the new connected Wi-Fi system called Google Wifi. This portfolio of products is an example of how we can marry the best of hardware and software to deliver the best Google experience to people.
Fourth, our increasing momentum in cloud; as we focus our efforts in the cloud, we continue to see strong customer engagement. Last month at our Horizon event, we introduced a new business unit, Google Cloud, our unique and broad portfolio of products and services that let our customers operate easily in a digital world with the performance they demand.
Google Cloud includes Google Cloud platform, our user-facing collaboration and productivity applications, now called G Suite, all of our data analytics and machine learning tools and APIs, and the enterprise-ready Android phones, tablets, and Chromebooks that access the cloud.
Our Cloud team has also been busy delivering new capabilities for our customers. We announced plans to expand to eight new cloud regions in 2017, from Mumbai to Singapore to São Paulo to Frankfurt, with more to come. We announced an enhanced media conference experience in Google Hangouts with an updated user interface, instant screen sharing, support for 50 participants, and a seamless integration into Calendar. We've been using the same technology to power meetings at Google, and are so excited to share the improved experience with our customers.
We also significantly upgraded Google BigQuery, our fully managed data analytics warehouse, and made Google Cloud Machine Learning available in beta to help businesses easily train quality machine learning models.
In addition to building the best products and infrastructure, we are partnering with great companies. This quarter, we forged new partnerships with OCTA [Orange County Transit Authority], Box, and Accenture.
Our investments in machine learning continue to be a very clear advantage for Google Cloud, and we are helping customers apply ML in very concrete ways. For example, Ocado, the world's largest online-only grocery retailer, is using machine learning to categorize and prioritize customer emails, which will help their support center respond to customers faster.
As we officially move into the Google Cloud era, our goal remains the same. We want to build the most open cloud for all businesses and make it easy for them to build and run great software. The team is firing on all cylinders to create the best cloud products in the industry for our customers.
Now moving on to growing advertising business, which is thriving in a mobile world. Our proposition to marketers on mobile is simple and is resonating. Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play are where people turn when they are actively interested in something. They are using our services because they want to actively watch something they are passionate about or because they want to know, go, do, or buy something. They are super-attentive and engaged. It's just like people used to be glued to their TV screen during prime time.
Our services are prime time for the mobile world. This matters for marketers because those prime time moments when people are actively interested and attentive are the perfect time for a brand to place their ads. For instance, hotel chain La Quinta now sees a third of their website traffic coming from mobile, and they use our hotel ads to help them reach travelers right when they are looking for hotel stays. They have found conversion rates to be twice as high with hotel ads compared to regular mobile traffic, which is helping them capitalize on those prime time moments when travelers are on their phones and ready to book.
In video, YouTube continues to shine. More than 1 billion monthly users are watching hundreds of millions of hours every single day. YouTube has become the platform of choice for major brands, with a highly engaged audience, the best formats, and industry-leading measurement tools. Recent research found that nearly half of U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 54 say that at least once a month, YouTube helps them in making a decision about buying something.
One format that's been working really well for ad prices are bumper ads, which are snackable, 6-second videos that help brands drive incremental reach and frequency. Brands like Universal Pictures have been pairing these shorter videos with their standard length ads on YouTube, and they're seeing great results, especially on mobile.
We also recently announced expanded capabilities to show marketers how TV and YouTube campaigns increase Google and YouTube searches for their brand. From early tests, we have seen that YouTube generates almost twice as many searches per impression than TV generates.
In fact, across our advertising business, measurement is a critical investment. We want to give marketers the best tools out there to close the loop between television and digital, online and offline. For example, global retailer IKEA, with their agency iProspect UK, used our store visits measurement tools to see how effective their digital marketing campaigns were at bringing shoppers into their stores. By incorporating store visit data, they realized that more than 10% of the people who clicked on their search ads went on to visit a physical store, and that their ROI from online ads was actually five times higher than they had previously estimated.
We introduced even more measurement solutions at this year's Advertising Week in New York, helping marketers close the loop with newer tools like location extensions and store visits measurements for the Google Display Network.
We have thousands of great partners who are getting terrific results from our products. I'm really pleased with how our business teams are working closer than ever with their advertising partners, agencies, marketers, and publishers. We can't succeed unless they do, and we have made a huge push to develop deeper partnerships and long-term win-win relationships. It's a big focus for us.
To wrap up, it's been an incredibly exciting few months and a very successful quarter. We feel extremely confident as we move into a new era of computing and are thrilled to be working with our partners as we embark on the journey together. I want to thank all of the Googlers around the world who work tirelessly to turn ideas into reality for our users and partners. It's an honor to work alongside you every day.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And our first question come from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you so much for taking the question. Sundar, maybe for you, on the enterprise, thanks for laying out all the vision for the medium to long term on the enterprise and cloud. I think one of the big questions we get from investors all the time are where are the key areas you need to invest going forward in both capabilities, go-to-market, and how those might evolve over the next couple years.
And then maybe a second question for Ruth, which is more a housekeeping matter, Ruth, with highlighting the increased marketing expense behind the product launches this year, were you referencing quarter-over-quarter or comparing year-over-year when you also launched products a year ago? Thanks so much.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
On cloud, let me talk about a few areas. We have stepped up our partnering considerably so that we can offer our customers everything they want, and we have more vehicles for going to market. So scaling up through partnerships is a big area of focus and investment for us. We are also establishing a large cloud machine learning group so that we can take advantages of working with our cloud customers and make machine learning more accessible to all of them. I would say other areas are hiring across sales, engineering, and marketing. And as we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and head count growth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And then on your second question, there were really two parts to the statement. One, the obvious, is that sales and marketing is seasonally higher whenever we go into the holiday season. And so year on year, I wanted just to accentuate the point that we expect this trend to be pronounced this year because we're expanding. We're launching an even more expanded suite of hardware products. So it's really emphasizing the fact that the fourth quarter is higher and even more so this year with the expanded suite.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thank you. I also wanted to ask a follow-up on the cloud. I guess I was wondering, Sundar, if you could share with us. What milestones should we be watching for in this business? And then also, if you had to characterize – you mentioned a couple different ones, but I'm wondering. What type of workloads are you having the most success with in GCP, and what's on your customers' wish list? What's the top one or two things that your enterprise customers for cloud might be asking for? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
Thanks, Heather. In general, the way we see it is that customers don't want to be locked in and they want to make sure their workloads can work in and be managed by containers that run on any platform. So our virtual machines and containers, including excellent open-sourced container management Kubernetes, which was developed by Google, offers that solution. So Kubernetes manages the provisioning, reliability, and auto-scaling of workloads. So we want to pursue a hybrid strategy, including on-prem and in all public clouds. So from a customer standpoint, they will want to use an open source workload management product, and Kubernetes can work with multiple customers. So that's broadly how we think about it.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks, guys, two questions. Sundar, first on the Alphabet structure high level, so there's been some incredible innovation that's come out of Alphabet and the various businesses. If we look at something like Otto, which was acquired by Uber, or Niantic, which was the old Google Maps team, those were teams that were inside of Google that left Alphabet to start a new company and could have been potentially wholly-owned businesses of Google in a parallel universe. So do you think this structure is ideal for entire companies, or is it just new products and new technologies that you see as the vision here for Alphabet long term?
And then, Ruth, the second question is just on – core operating margins for Google have declined a little bit versus the prior quarter trend of increasing. Can you give us some color on how much of that was due to mix towards cloud and other things that might carry lower margin versus margin compression within the advertising business? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
Ross, on the first question, I would say overall when I look across Google and Alphabet, the number of areas where we have been able to build world-class products and achieve scale and success, we today have over seven products which serve 1 billion users each, so I think our track record speaks there. And we generally want to encourage a culture of innovation and that's what we focus on, and I think it is fine that some of them happen outside. So we don't view it as a zero-sum game, and we're very comfortable with how we approach it.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And then in terms of the margin trends, so overall operating margins year on year are up modestly on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and that primarily reflects trends in Other Bets. I think your question was probably more within Google. The operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is down modestly year on year. That's primarily to other cost of sales as distinct from TAC. The Google GAAP operating margins year on year and quarter on quarter do reflect the impact of the equity refresh that we called out last quarter that I talked about.
I think one of the core things to your question is just how we're looking at it, and our view continues to be that given the breadth of opportunities and our commitment to long-term revenue growth, as we've talked about, quarter after quarter we do remain committed to investing in this growing set of opportunities. And we've spent a lot of time trying to manage that revenue growth, and as I said, manage expense growth with the utmost respect for the resources deployed and getting the best return on those resources.
So there are a number of different factors in here. I think I mentioned one of the things as you're looking forward was the sales and marketing. And just to make another point, which I said my opening comments, we do expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC associated with Mobile Search and with programmatic. That does still result in more revenue and gross profit dollars but at a lower margin, and that's the other really important point with our starting point. We are continuing to invest, and we would point you to the revenue and gross profit dollars that come from that.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. With Google Home and the Pixel phones, are you rethinking at all your go-to-market strategy in terms of distribution and marketing? Google over the years has put out different hardware products. Have there been learnings from that that make you approach those two particular areas in Google Home and the Pixel phone lineup differently? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
Thanks, Mark. As you point out, we have done hardware products over the years, but we saw an opportunity to bring all our display hardware efforts together in a thoughtful structure. I'm glad Rick [Osterloh] is here, and we've been very focused on how we approach everything end to end so that we can bring together software and hardware for a great user experience.
So along those lines, both Google Home in Google Pixel are important new efforts for us, and I think we will thoughtfully evolve our go-to-market strategy as well. These are important areas. And you already see with Google Pixel we have a deep partnership at Verizon with which we are going to market in the U.S. And so we are constantly thinking about how to do this well, and you will see new approaches as we go through it more.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, you talked about a lot of products across advertising and hardware. I think one thing we did not hear about was Maps. And I think you've talked about it in the past as 1 billion-plus users and pretty massive engagement. So can you talk a little bit more about the monetization strategy here and how you can really sell more advertising here but also preserve the user experience at the same time? And maybe talk about a timeframe that we could see more here. Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
That's a good question. Today, a big part of what you're seeing with our transition to mobile that's working really well. The reason Mobile Search and mobile monetization works really well for us is because a lot of it is inherently local by nature. And the thing which helps us deliver a great local search experience is Maps. And so that's the direction we have always pointed in. We want it to be a great experience for consumers as Google Maps, but in terms of also really enhancing the local search experience. And I think you'll continue to see us perceive it that way. And over time to the extent there are opportunities to create value within the application itself, we'll pursue that as well.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one about Voice. Sundar, you talked about the success you've had in improving your natural language recognition, and we know that voice queries are growing quickly. I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts on how the increase in voice queries may or may not impact monetization going forward. Is it a risk, or is the growth of voice queries much more skewed to less commercial activity? Just any thoughts there, thanks so much.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
Thanks, Peter. From my standpoint, I look at it as – and if you look back in time, all this is – computing is becoming more and more important to people, and so they are engaging with it more and more. So as we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other. The sum total of all of this, it expanded the pie. I approach this the same way. I think as I see people using Voice, et cetera, they are interacting more with computing and with Google too. So we view this as providing users more access across many different surfaces, many different contexts, being there for them when they need it. So in that view, I think it will all be a big positive for us going forward.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just to go back to the Voice Search question, Sundar, could you just talk a little bit about if we do continue to migrate toward a world of Voice Search, just talk about infrastructure, potential build you think you need to put in place to continue to monetize search in a voice world as well as you do in a phone or a desktop world.
And then secondly, could you just talk a little bit about where you are on the rollout of extended text ads? I know you talked about a 20% bump to click-through rates. I was just curious for where you are now, a push-out, and is there any update on the click-throughs? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
On the first question, I think I briefly answered it before. In terms of – we are thinking about the voice experience deeply end to end. A lot of it is going – because of how we are approaching our core investments both from a software and hardware standpoint, so we leverage it all to make it better. So for example, even things like TP usage we talked about at Google I/O play a role into something like Voice Search you're talking about. And as we evolve the Google Assistant, I think voice is going to play a major role that way as well.
So we are in very early days of all of this in relation to our overall volumes we see, and so I think we will be thoughtful about it. For example, the Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the Voice experience. So it's early days, and I think we will evolve it a lot in the coming years.
In terms of your second question around expanded text ads, I would say again it's early. It's being adopted by advertisers across the board. We see both large and small advertisers using it. For us, we find advertisers who actually spend their time being thoughtful about the ad creatives and extensively testing and optimizing for this new format, they find strong performance. So we are pleased with the progress so far, but the transition is going to take some time as advertisers get comfortable with it, but we are excited about it.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. First one for Ruth, heading into this quarter's results, you had called out the ad format change in the third quarter of last year, which had driven a step up in the year-ago growth rate. I wonder, is there anything specific on the revenue side that you'd like to call out in terms of comparisons versus the fourth quarter of last year as we try to calibrate our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter, either in terms of Mobile Search, YouTube, or ad tech programmatic?
And then my second question is either for Ruth or Sundar. Can you just talk about the decision to pause efforts for Google Fiber? I'm wondering, was that decision more about financial discipline, as you I think explained, Ruth, in your prepared remarks for the Other Bets, or does it more have to do with the shift to wireless Internet technology or point-to-point wireless, which ultimately can take the place of a Fiber or facilities-based infrastructure over time? Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Okay, great, two good questions. So in terms of Sites revenue, we are very pleased by the strength. It was broad-based. It had two real drivers, first, our ongoing focus on improving the experience for advertisers and users. And we introduced a number of enhancements, including format changes in ad tools. I think the most important point is that no one enhancement came close to the magnitude of the changes that we made in the third quarter of last year. That's why we kept calling out the 2015 change. And what's been gratifying is in the aggregate the results reflect the benefit of ongoing innovation. But very importantly, it wasn't one particular item.
The second contributor is the secular shift to mobile, and we continue to benefit from that, be an important part of enhancing opportunities for engagement.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter, I think that was part of your question as well. I think the only thing to point out is that in looking at growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year, so that to us is an important point. It may be obvious, but important to note there.
In terms of Fiber, the impetus for it was really about the opportunities that we see to focus on innovation, and what does that mean if the objective with Other Bets is really these 10X opportunities. And when you go back to the initial impetus for creating the business, it was the founders' view that there's a sizable opportunity given the need for abundant connectivity on networks that are always fast and always open, and we do continue to be committed to that vision.
The team had some important breakthroughs in new technologies. You noted the most important in our view, all that we're doing with wireless, but also technologies that are key to implementation. And we believe that both of those, a number of things they're doing enhance both our effectiveness and efficiency. And so we wanted to focus on the potential with these efforts before we reaccelerate deployment. And it was about ensuring that we can take advantage of those before again pushing forth.
We were very active in a lot of cities in the third quarter alone. We rolled out four new cities, so that brings us to 12 cities across the U.S. where we're deployed, in construction, or in development, and we're making great progress in those cities. We remain very committed to growth across those cities. And then we also have a presence in six cities with our wireless acquisition, Webpass. So we're pausing for now our work in eight cities where we've been in exploratory discussions. But very much to your question, it's to better integrate some of the technology work we've been developing, and there's more detail on the cities on the Fiber side to the extent you want to go into those.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay, thank you very much. So, Sundar, it seems like from the outside looking in, the pace of product development and release seems to have accelerated, while at the same time it seems like you're gaining efficiencies with the assets you're deploying to run your business and as your CapEx growth is moderating. So I'm wondering what concrete steps you may have taken to increase productivity or focus at the company and what you're doing now to continue to drive those gains going forward.
Then separately, as you called out earlier, you are shipping an unprecedented amount of hardware devices. So as you think about what your product portfolio might look like over the next five years or even the next decade, does the Pixel phone market change in direction for Google to become maybe more of an integrated software and hardware company? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
Thanks, Stephen. On the first thing, I would say we are very focused on our core mission. And we see a huge opportunity to do that in a unique way, thanks to what we view as a point of inflection with machine learning. So refocusing the company on a set of initiatives, recognizing that point of inflection is what has helped us really focus on things. And things like the Google Assistant are a manifestation of that, and you will see us continue to stay focused and innovate that way.
In terms of hardware, I think in our vision, computing is becoming more and more integral. It's going to be there for users in many different contexts. And so to really think and evolve it, you need to think about software and hardware together. That's where a lot of innovations happen. And so for us to push the paradigm, push the boundary, we are very committed to doing that. So it's a thoughtful effort from us. But overall, as I said in my remarks, we deeply remain committed to building an open ecosystem because at the end of the day we want Google to be there for every user everywhere. And to do that well, we want to work with partners and build a great ecosystem to make it happen.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And just to add a bit more to Sundar's first answer or first response to your question about efficiency as it's expressed through CapEx spend, I think it will probably be helpful to add. The pace of spend reflects the ongoing success of the team driving meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure. And that's enabled us to support growing demand but at a stable investment level. We've talked about that on prior calls as well, but I think we're proud of what they've been doing there.
Some examples of efficiencies include improvements in server utilization and the use of machine learning that Sundar has talked about, and the deployment of innovations like our Tensor Processing Units that he has commented. So the main thing is we're building greater productivity with existing machines. And what's important to note is that's not only good for Google products generally, but it's also valuable to our cloud offering for our enterprise customers.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Sena of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Kenneth Sena - Evercore Group LLC
Thank you. Sundar, you mentioned a point of inflection within machine learning. Can you talk a bit more about the trade-offs in the productization and sale of that inflection through Google Cloud versus leveraging that innovation yourself through Google Assistant?
And maybe for Ruth, just any thoughts on potential future disclosures around the cloud business, that would be great. Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
On the first one, look, I think we are – it's a big platform shift, and it has to be available for everyone. So we've always, just like we have done with things like Android, when we see platform shifts, we provide Android to everyone. So that's the way we think about Google Cloud. We want to make sure that all these new capabilities for machine learning and AI are available through Google Cloud to all our partners. We don't see it as a zero-sum game. I think internally, core to our mission, we see areas where we can execute and we will continue to do that, but we want to do both and we can do it thoughtfully well.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
On your second question, we constantly look to assess if or when additional data makes sense given specific performances. And when we went through the third quarter results, that has been our intent with all of the color commentary on cloud. I guess the only other thing to add is that the largest percentage growth year on year in our other revenue line, actually even across all of our revenue lines, was in our Google Cloud platform, and that reflects significant momentum in compute and storage.
Kenneth Sena - Evercore Group LLC

Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Sundar, I apologize if I missed it. But could you talk about machine learning in search and how much it's making a difference over the past few quarters and how much you still have to go, how important that is to revenues?
And then, Ruth, a couple questions, any thoughts on whether hardware sales could make a difference to margins going forward, and also on the stock-based comp, how Google thinks about that expense internally? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
On machine learning, in areas like search and even ads, on search we've had an effort called RankBrain, which is bringing Google Brain in the context of search. And we've made great progress on it, but I would still characterize it as very early stages in terms of the long-term impact we can have. Generally and similarly, we are in very, very early stages of incorporating machine learning, the newer machine learning systems in ads. And again, that's the beginning of a long journey as well.
Overall, I think all of these systems are incredibly complex systems, and they are handcrafted systems over many, many years. And so over time, I think machine learning will surface newer approaches and newer insights. And so we see it as a huge area of opportunity, but it will play out over a period of time.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And then in terms of the hardware family, I think Sundar has given a lot of color on that. It's still early days with the rollout of some of these newer lines that we're super-excited about. And so early to make a call on that, but certainly investing meaningfully in the line given the importance we see in this.
And then in terms of stock-based compensation, we've always said we're going to remain focused on long-term revenue growth, and that does require investing in talent. And we do believe equity ownership is a really valuable part of our overall compensation, consistent with alignment of interests. It's something we keep an eye on and we're mindful of the full cost of equity-based compensation and certainly look at that as part of the overall costs that we're investing in, in and across the businesses.

Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey, guys. Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. Sundar, last month Google was part of the founding group for the Partnership for AI. And I was just curious to hear your thoughts on what your goals are for the group and how you may take lessons back to your leadership at Google. Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
Look, I think I'm very, very glad to see the group come together. We are in extraordinarily early days for AI and it's super-important, but we approach it thoughtfully as an industry. I am encouraged to see the commitment across these companies. Our goal is to promote open collaboration, help the public understand AI, and establish best practices in R&D. Without something like this, I think ideas would develop in silos, and so I think it's good to do this to promote an informed dialogue on AI.
And so I'm pretty excited all along, just like with TensorFlow, where we are doing this in an open way and all the other things we have done at Google. I think it's important as we work on new technology to contribute and to give back. And so in that context, I think all of this is personally very meaningful to me.

Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Ellen. Our revenue of $21.5 billion in the second quarter underscores the great performance of our businesses globally. For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 25% in constant currency versus last year. Once again, the primary driver was the increased use of Mobile Search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the Mobile Search experience. We also benefited from solid growth in Desktop and Tablet Search as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising.
I'm going to present to you in the following order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets; finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, total revenue was $21.5 billion, up to 21% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $113 million, or $35 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 25% year-over-year and increased 5% sequentially.
Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe as well as the impact the currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business relative to last year. U.S. revenue was up 25% year-over-year to $10 billion. UK revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 20% year-over-year. These results do not reflect the movement in the British pound subsequent to the results of the referendum on June 23. Rest-of-world revenue was up 19% versus last year to $9.6 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year-over-year.
GAAP other cost of revenues were $4.2 billion. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion, up 28% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs.
GAAP operating expenses were $7.4 billion in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.2 billion, or 29% of revenue, up 15% year-over-year and up 2% versus Q1. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by R&D expense, mainly due to compensation expense related to head count growth.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 28%. Non-GAAP operating income was $7.5 billion, up 25% versus last year. The operating margin was 35%.
Stock-based compensation totaled $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased head count and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every two years.
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 66,575, up 2,460 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud and apps. On a numbers basis, we are adding more head count in Google, while on a percentage basis, we are growing faster in Other Bets.
Other income and expense was $151 million [income].
As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items impacted by market factors, which makes it inherently unpredictable. We provide more detail on these line items in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 20%.
Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP basis and $5.9 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.00 on a GAAP basis and $8.42 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $9.1 billion, with free cash flow of $7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $78.5 billion, of which approximately $48 billion, or 61%, is held overseas. This performance reflects our strong operating cash flow, offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion, completing the authorization under our share repurchase program.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment, revenue was $21.3 billion, up 21% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $15.4 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile Search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad format and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year. We continue to have solid growth from Desktop and Tablet Search.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and increasingly Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year on year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional Network businesses.
Other revenue for Google was $2.2 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by Cloud and Apps as well as Play, followed by hardware.
Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are, of course, affected by currency movements.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 18% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down slightly as a result of a mix shift between Sites revenue, which carries lower TAC, and Network revenue. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely Mobile Search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Operating income excluding SBC was $8.3 billion, up 26% versus last year, for an operating margin of 39%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 33% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7 billion, up 25% versus last year, and the operating margin was 33%. CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets financials, let me again emphasize that the majority of these efforts are pre-revenue. We continue to invest across these opportunities and are doing so in a disciplined way. We think it remains most instructive is to look at them over a longer time horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons. First, they are early-stage. Second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. And third, they may be impacted by one-time items like partnership deals.
For the second quarter, Other Bets revenue was $185 million. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $709 million in the second quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $859 million. Other Bets CapEx was $280 million in Q2, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business.
I'd like to close with a few observations on our key themes. First, regarding revenue, our Alphabet structure, announced nearly a year ago, gives us the framework for developing new sources of revenue growth within both Google and in Other Bets in a disciplined way. You've seen over the past few quarters how our focus on innovation can drive strong revenue growth. We are continually working to enhance the search experience and making changes to our ads formats and tools, guided by substantial user testing. We have repeatedly highlighted the 3Q 2015 change in format given the meaningful step-up it drove in our revenue growth rate. That benefit is evident again in the second quarter. As we've always said, we have been and remain committed to long-term revenue growth through innovation, but the timing and scale of the impact of innovation is inherently difficult to predict.
Second, as to expenses, I've commented many times that our focus on long-term revenue growth does not give us a pass on managing expenses. We invest a lot of time and effort in assessing how to manage for revenue growth with the utmost respect for the resources deployed and a focus on getting the best return on those resources, recognizing that in some areas secular trends are creating margin headwinds.
As I mentioned last quarter, there are number factors driving higher TAC in both our Sites and Network businesses. For Sites TAC, there are a number of factors that contribute to fluctuations, in particular, changes in the relative use of mobile, desktop, and tablet devices. For each of these devices, Sites TAC also reflects an interrelated set of factors, including the mix of paid versus organic distribution points, partners, and agreement terms. Over the past year, the shift to mobile has been the primary driver of the increase in Sites TAC because more mobile searches are subject to TAC.
When looking at Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue, it's important also to remember that while YouTube advertising revenue is reflected in our Sites line, the associated content acquisition costs are included in other cost of revenues, not TAC. In addition, Sites revenue includes hedging gains with no associated effect on TAC.
The growth in Network TAC is due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate.
In operating expenses, people are our biggest area of investment. We continue to attract, develop, and retain the best people to drive our businesses forward. As you would expect, head count additions primarily align with our priority areas, such as cloud and apps and machine learning.
Two important points regarding the third quarter; first, you will see the impact in the third quarter of our annual equity refresh for our employees. As you have seen in prior years, the annual refresh results in a sequential step-up in SBC.
Second, head count growth tends to be seasonally high in Q3 because that is when we bring on new graduates. In addition, please keep in mind that our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season.
Third, regarding CapEx, at Google the team has been able to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure, which has enabled us to support growing demand at a stable investment level. These efficiencies include improvements in power and server utilization, the use of machine learning, and deployment of innovations like our Tensor Processing Unit. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our Fiber investment continues to be the driver.
Fourth, about our balance sheet, we remain focused on optimizing our capital structure, recognizing the strategic value of our balance sheet. We completed Alphabet's $1.7 billion debt exchange in the second quarter, which gives us flexibility, including the ability to use debt financing if appropriate. In light of the interest rate environment, we may opportunistically access the market to term out our commercial paper.
In conclusion, in the second quarter we delivered very strong revenue growth and improved operating efficiency. These results reflect the tremendous talent and hard work of our teams around the globe.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Thanks, Ruth.
As you heard, we had a very strong second quarter. There's an amazing energy right now at Google. The strength of the quarter is about Mobile. It's transformed the way that people consume information, and Google's products have become a central and much-loved part of their experience. Our investment in Mobile now underlines everything that we do today, from Search and YouTube to Android and advertising. Mobile is the engine that drives our present. And now to our deep investments in machine learning and AI, we are building the engine that will drive our future.
Since the last earnings call, we had Google I/O, our biggest event of the year, and I also wrote our annual Founders' Letter. Both of these allowed me to reflect on our past and look to our future. We are at a pivotal and transformational moment. Thanks to advancements in machine learning, we have the unique opportunity to take a big step forward for the next 10 years. In the letter, I wrote about how we think of our investments and our mission. Today, I'll walk through the six sections of the Founders' Letter and discuss our progress in each area. And then I'll call out three key highlights from the quarter that are driving our advertising business today and into the future.
The first thing I highlighted in the Founders' Letter was information. At Google's core, we remain focused on making information and knowledge available for everyone. This of course starts with Search, where we now have trillions of searches every year. We continue to invest in making Search smarter and more useful. In the U.S., we recently introduced a voter tool, so when you search to register to vote, you will get a detailed state-by-state guide with information on how to register, requirements, and deadlines.
Our new keyboard for iOS, called Gboard, is off to a great start. People love the ability to easily search right from the keyboard, swipe to type, and quickly send emojis. And after just one year, Google Photos is now helping over 200 million people every month organize and search their photos and memories.
At I/O, I was excited to share our vision around the Google Assistant. We want to help people get things done in a conversational way across devices and context. This is possible thanks to advances in machine learning, voice and image recognition, and natural language processing, which we have invested in for years. You will be able to experience the Google Assistant in products like our new messaging app, Allo, and our voice-activated device, Google Home, and we can't wait to show you what else we are working on in this area.
Second, machine learning; as I said, machine learning is the engine that will drive our future, and it's already making our products better and helping users every day. In fact, more than 100 teams are currently using machine learning at Google, from Street View to Gmail to Voice Search and more. For example, in Search, we use a ranking signal called RankBrain, which relies on deep learning to improve results. It's already enhancing the search experience in 40 languages. And based on user testing, RankBrain can accurately guess which results users will favor with about 80% accuracy. Advances like this help us make our search results even more relevant.
Machine learning is also creating an impact in other ways. Just last week, we announced a test that applied DeepMind's machine learning to our own Google data centers, resulting in up to a 40% reduction in the energy we use for cooling. This will greatly improve efficiency. And when we publish our research, we hope it will enable others to reduce emissions, too.
Third, content; a big part of making information available is making great content accessible, such as on Google Play, YouTube, and the web. Our efforts to make the mobile web better for everyone with Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, has seen phenomenal global momentum. We now have over 150 million AMP pages in our index and with over 4 million new ones published every week from nearly 200 countries. Last week, we announced AMP for Ads, which helps advertisers build fast, simple, and beautiful ads and landing pages. This will help make the mobile web experience much faster for everyone and help fund it more sustainably.
Video is a huge component of digital content, and YouTube continues to shine. It's a thriving home for creators, with more than 1,000 creators crossing the 1,000 subscribers mark every single day. Our content diary (20:25) system has now paid out over $2 billion to partners who use the system.
A big part of video, of course, is live, which we have invested in since 2011. YouTube is the first major platform that supports live content in 360 degrees, and we recently announced the ability for creators to go live from their phones with the touch of a button. Earlier in the quarter, we teamed up with BT to livestream the Champions League and Europa League finals on YouTube in the UK. This special event was UK's biggest-ever livestream. All these innovations are a big reason why partner revenue has averaged 50% growth over the last three years.
Fourth, platforms; a key focus is building great computing platforms like Chrome, Android, and our new virtual reality platform, Daydream, so that people can have wonderful experiences regardless of the device or stream they are using. Platforms are what make new computing experiences possible and also power breakout hits like Pokémon Go, which I suspect a few of you are playing right now.
Android is thriving. In the last year alone, we have delivered over 65 billion app installs and are helping developers reach an audience of over 1 billion users every single month. Our partners are also seeing incredible successes with flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy S7. It's a hit with consumers and a shining example of how to build a great experience on Android. Our latest version of Android, called Nougat, focuses on performance, productivity, and security. And it also has a VR mode built in to help developers create immersive smartphone VR experiences.
Speaking of VR, we are already working with leading Android partners to build out the Daydream ecosystem, so stay tuned for more Daydream-ready phones, controllers, and headsets coming this fall.
Fifth, cloud; many tremendous digital experiences are being built in the cloud today, and businesses are working to take advantage of the cloud as part of their digital transformation. We've been integrating our cloud and apps products to create more unified solutions for companies large and small, and these efforts are paying off. We have strong momentum with businesses like Symphony, a secular communication and workflow platform, who recently announced that its cloud computing business is available on the Google Cloud Platform [GCP]. We provide the high reliability and performance needed by Symphony's customers in the financial services industry.
Our data analytics product, BigQuery, helps mobile gaming company, Kabam, store and understand player actions within their games, from monetization and fraud to production bugs and level completion statistics.
As I've said, machine learning has been a major focus and a key differentiator for Google, and that's true for our Google Cloud customers as well. This quarter, we introduced Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which can deliver an order of magnitude better optimized performance per watt for machine learning projects. Google DeepMind's AlphaGo was powered by TPUs, enabling it to process faster and look farther ahead between moves. We are now passing this benefit on to our enterprise customers to supercharge their machine learning applications.
Just last week, we introduced two cloud machine learning APIs for speech and natural language to help our enterprise customers convert audio to text and easily understand the structure and sentiment of the text in a variety of languages.
We also introduced a new undersea cable system, the highest capacity system ever built, which brings added capacity and performance to support our enterprise customers around the globe. This system has 60 terabytes per second of total capacity, more than any active undersea cable and is 10 million times faster than your cable modem. This is especially exciting as we prepare to launch a new Google Cloud Platform, East Asia region, in Tokyo later this year.
In addition to building the best products and infrastructure, we are also hard at work building the best team to serve every aspect of our customers' businesses. We now have key leadership in place and centralized teams supporting customer-facing activities, including sales, marketing, global alliances, industry solutions, and professional services. We are building out our support at full scale as more and more Fortune 100 companies choose our cloud.
Sixth, building for everyone; since the Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers, we are committed to building technology and making information available for everyone, wherever they are. This has always been core to Google's DNA. As we have shared before, we are working with Indian Railways and RailTel to bring high-speed wireless access to the entire Internet to millions of people who travel throughout India's top railway stations. There are already 2 million people logging in every month, and they are using as much as 15 times the data they would otherwise use in a full day on their cellular networks.
We are also working hard to ensure that our products work well for everyone, regardless of where they live. We've been expanding better carrier building (25:55) in Google Play with more than 100 partners in 40 countries. To give you a sense of the impact, in Indonesia alone, we have seen growth in monthly buyers quadruple in the last 18 months.
Switching gears from these six areas, it's our business success that enables us and our partners to grow and invest further. We are extraordinarily well positioned to take advantage of the mobile shift, and we are already seeing strong growth in three key areas of our advertising business, Mobile Search, Video, and Programmatic. All of the momentum you're seeing is because our products are doing well in Mobile and our customers are getting great results from them.
We offer advertisers and agencies the best ways to reach customers at the right moment of intent, the best reach in inventory, the best mobile formats, and the leading measurement solutions. And of course, we do all of this while making sure we are creating a great ads experience for users that's helpful and unobtrusive. We know that people are constantly searching for things with commercial intent and are used to swiping and tapping. Our data shows that people respond really well to that, as we show. They are fresh, fast, and useful.
So let me turn to three key moments from the quarter for our advertising business, number one, our Google Performance Summit for direct response marketers. We announced new Expanded Text Ads and bid adjustments by device type, which are rolling out this week, as well as new local search ads in Google Maps. Thanks to the rise of mobile phones, the line between online and offline experiences continues to blur. This creates even greater opportunity for businesses to use Google Maps to help bring customers into their physical store locations.
Thanks to our strong intent signals, particularly on mobile, Google continues to offer great opportunities for direct response marketers to reach potential customers, whether they are visiting your website, calling your business, walking into your store, or downloading your app. For instance, Walgreens partnered closely with Google to promote their app across Search, Google Play, and our Display Networks. In one month, they increased the number of app downloads 87% from the previous month.
Number two, our annual Brandcast event for brand advertisers was a huge success. We announced breakout videos. The ability to advertise against fast-rising videos on YouTube as well as a deal with the NBA to bring their inventory to Google Preferred. At this point, the volume of Google Preferred bought this year is already more than double what it was at the same time last year.
Fast food chain Wendy's used Google Preferred to extend the reach of their TV ads. And thanks to our Brand Lift measurement solution, they were able to see that one of their campaigns drove an incredible 65% lift in ad recall and 146% lift in Google searches for the Wendy's brand. We are hearing a lot of the same feedback from many top brands who continue to invest more and more of their budgets on YouTube.
And number three, our DoubleClick Leadership Summit, held just last week for ad technology partners. We launched the ability to buy native ads programmatically across all screens in DoubleClick Bid Manager. Since we're providing fully designed creatives for each publisher, advertisers can simply upload the contents of the ad like headline, image, and text, and DoubleClick automatically assembles them to fit the context and format of the site or app where they appear. Making native advertising simple at this scale will help to make ads faster, better, and less intrusive while driving great returns for publishers.
So there are my top three moments from our Advertising business this quarter. As you can see, it's been extremely busy. More generally, from advertising, to cloud, to digital content, to hardware, and to so much more, we have tremendous long-term growth opportunities at Google. Today's great innovations are being driven by investments in Mobile. Tomorrow's will be driven from our investments in machine learning and new computing platforms. But one thing is constant. We'll continue to focus on building the best experiences for billions of people around the world.
I want to thank all the Googlers around the world who help us create these opportunities every day and help bring them to life for our users and partners.
With that, I will turn it back over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And our first question comes from Carlos Kirjner of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. I have two questions. First is about Search revenues. Search is probably a $50 billion business, and from today's results it's clearly still growing strongly. Of course, as the business gets larger, it becomes harder and harder to sustain growth. As you look at this increasing growth challenge on your product innovations in Search, including the recent changes and also those that you have in your roadmap for the next few years, how do you think about your ability to sustain such revenues growth and the trajectory over which they will ultimately decelerate?
The second question is on Google Fiber. I think Ruth has been quite clear that we should expect an increase in Other Bets CapEx and that Fiber is the main driver, suggesting more investment. Yet, when we see the rate at which you will have deployed in markets like Austin and some of the newer markets, they are quite slow. You also have started to talk about wireless technology, suggesting that you haven't fully figured this out yet, which in turn suggests that it's going to be slow deployment. So the question is, which one is it? Is it faster, more aggressive deployment given the CapEx commentary, or is it going to be continuous slow multiyear deployment as your track record and the talk of new technologies suggest? Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thank you, Carlos, a lot in those questions. So starting with Sites revenue and where we see the opportunities there, obviously Sites revenue up 24% year on year includes the currency impact. And as Sundar and I both commented on, the biggest driver again this quarter was Mobile Search. We do continue to have solid growth in Desktop, Tablet. And we have strength in YouTube, particularly video advertising, both in our TrueView product and increasingly from Google Preferred. As we've talked about every quarter since the third quarter of last year, we have benefited from the change to ad formats on Mobile that we made in third quarter of last year, and that is evident yet again this quarter.
Then, as per your question, going back to that third quarter of 2015 when we made the change in ad formats on Mobile, our growth rate meaningfully accelerated. And as we've noted in each subsequent quarter, that change has been the primary driver of the higher year-on-year revenue growth rate. But importantly, as you've seen over the last several quarters, we're benefiting not just from the higher growth rate but also from the durability of the impact of the change. So that's really underscoring the efficacy of these ads for users, as per Sundar's comments, and it's reflected in revenues running at a higher level. And you can see where the revenue growth rate was prior to the third quarter introduction. I'll let you do your own forecasting, but when comparing growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year.
And then Sundar talked about some of the recent events that we've had. Innovation is core to everything we're doing. We've launched several changes to ad formats and tools just a few days ago. As the team discussed at the Google Performance Summit, we believe the changes should result in a better, more useful experience for users and better performance for advertisers. And so that just continues to be core to the way we're looking at the business with a lot of incremental opportunity.
And then on your Fiber and CapEx question, look, we continue to see Fiber as a huge market opportunity. We're focused on creating abundant connectivity on networks that are always fast and always open, as we've talked about, and we're continuing to work closely with cities given their excitement. We're also continuing to push the frontier with tech innovation, as you noted in your question, and different execution paths. So as you said in the question, we're exploring both Fiber and wireless, and you may have seen our recent acquisition of Webpass. So we want to make sure we're executing against a very large and attractive market in the most effective and efficient manner. We did start adding customers in Charlotte in July. And so again, we view it as a big opportunity. We're being thoughtful and deliberate in our execution path.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe following up on Carlos, his question on Search, and Ruth, your answer, I wanted to go a little bit deeper on the retail and the travel verticals. It's two areas where we see a lot of innovation from the company right now, both on the product side that consumers are seeing as well as on the advertising side. How should we think about the roadmap ahead for both increased user engagement with your product in those key verticals as well as the ability for advertiser conversion to lead to more advertising budgets for the company over the medium to long term?
And then maybe one second question would be, with the buyback authorization having been completed this quarter, Ruth, I would love to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about the balance sheet as an asset and how shareholders should think about the ability for shareholder returns over the medium and long term. Thank you so much.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Okay, so why don't I start on your second question? Then I'll pass it to Sundar on the first question. So as you know, we announced the share repurchase program relatively recently. It was just in the third quarter of last year, and we just completed it as per my opening comments. As we discussed back in the third quarter, we do always review our balance sheet and capital requirements and opportunities with our board, and I'm not going to speculate about a potential for a future board decision, so really nothing more to add at this point. And then, Sundar?
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Look, we obviously think generally across all types of verticals, and you highlighted a couple of important verticals. To give an example on travel, many users start their travel inquiry on Google. And so we focus on doing a better job of getting them deeper information, new destinations, and compare costs through new features in Hotel Search [Hotel Finder], Google Flights, and the recently launched Destinations on Google. In all of this, we work closely with many different partners, including online travel agencies, and so we focus on product enhancements in partnership with them. And the better job we do at answering user queries, the more qualified leads we can provide to our partners, and we think it's win-win arrangement. And the same concept applies for these other verticals as well. So we approach it very holistically.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thank you very much. Sundar, I was wondering. I know you gave us some color on the Cloud business just a few moments ago in your prepared remarks. But I was wondering if you could share with us some of the changes, if you could highlight some of them that Diane [Greene] has made since she's come onboard. And I'm wondering how some of those changes might be starting to impact conversations with potential customers that you're having. In particular, I'm just trying to get a sense of, are you seeing Google now with GCP getting invited to more RFPs and starting to see your win rates go up as a result of some of her initiatives? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Thanks, Heather. Absolutely, I think Diane has initiated a set of changes, and essentially she has integrated our go-to-market strategy with our engineering and product efforts. She has integrated our engineering efforts on the cloud. So for example, Google Apps, Drive, Docs, Gmail, Slides, Sheets, Hangouts, et cetera, is on top the cloud stack. Our enterprise customers and partners for them, now they have one enterprise face and internally from frictionless contracts to touch points across Google, to one person to work with them on our considerable enterprise technologies and products, so the big unifying one being Cloud. We now have new leadership in place across sales, professional services, marketing, and partnering plus new customer facing support in the form of professional services. We have an office of the CTO and customer reliability.
So it's a big set of changes, and it's obviously having an impact. Many of our customers are also partners since it's increasingly clear how much we can do together. So for me, I see a shift to a world-class enterprise approach, and it's definitely having an impact on the type of conversations we are having and the outcome of the RFPs we are engaged in.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thank you very much.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Sundar, I just had a question about machine learning. So you spent a lot of time talking about how this is positively impacting Google as a whole and how you're building for the future, both tonight and at I/O a few months ago. And you guys have mentioned things like reducing the error rates in Search and improving relevancy. But are there tangible examples of either engagement or volume also increasing as you roll out machine learning in Search and in YouTube that you could share?
And then, I think Google recently introduced Smart Bidding in AdWords using machine learning. So do you see something like this as a potential revenue driver? Any color there would be great. Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
So we definitely – a core part of improving the user experience for the next many years will be driven by machine learning. To give a specific example, you asked about YouTube. YouTube watch time is something we focus on. We use machine learning increasingly to give recommendations to users. So when they're watching a video in terms of what they could watch next, and that recommendation system is increasingly using machine learning, and that directly drives engagement. So there are several such examples I can give across the company.
You mentioned AdWords, too. If you look at AdWords and the thoughtful changes we do, over time, we are dealing with paid commentarial space in terms of the kinds of changes and interactions that can happen. So deploying machine learning there over time, over many years, I think is a more powerful and deeper way to explore the various possibilities that exist and I think will lead to long-term impacts. And so I'm very optimistic on it.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask two. First, Sundar, you talked about Expanded Text Ads. And my question is just as the number of characters here increases somewhat, say, up to 50% through Expanded Text Ads, you're taking up more space on the page. How do you balance the higher percentage of clicks from these paid ads with the natural search experience?
And then secondly, on YouTube, do you think you're taking share of TV dollars currently? And if not, what's needed to do that going forward? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
On the first one, we obviously, over many, many years, we always put users first. And as we present our search results, we have long-term metrics for user happiness around which we make, that's the framework for all the changes we make. Obviously, with the shift to mobile, the user experience, users are evolving in terms of how they use our product. And with that as a guidance, we have made changes. We make many, many changes and I would look at it holistically. And even some of the changes you're talking about affect certain highly commercial queries, where users are actually looking for that commercial information. So the metrics is what drives how we change these things, and I'm being very, very thoughtful about it. But we always step back and make sure the overall load, et cetera, is really working for users. And I'm pretty comfortable with how we are approaching it.
On YouTube, I think about it as we are seeing strong growth. I mentioned the momentum behind Google Preferred and how we are double the rate we were last year. So to me, that implies strong growth. It's tough for us to assess whether it's from TV or just advertisers investing more because there's traction in YouTube, but we just see strong momentum. And as far as today, when I just look at how users are using mobile, video is the killer app, killer format on mobile, and I think that's what gives us the secular trend moving forward.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. I just want to ask one question and it has to do with Mobile Search. And I want to throw an idea by you, which is we've been going through this mobile transition for four or five years. Consumers have I think dramatically led businesses and advertisers to mobile devices. I'm wondering if what you're now seeing is finally, as e-commerce and travel and other commerce activities have really become critical and material on mobile devices, you're finally starting to see ad budgets really shift over and you're starting to get auction dynamics start to pick up in Mobile Search. So could you just comment on whether you're finally seeing this kind of backswing for advertisers to engage with Mobile Search in a way that you really hadn't seen before; it just took that many years for this to happen? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Mark, thanks for the question. I would say at a higher level, this is a scale business. And you're right, as we have had this shift to mobile, there are second-order effects which kick in too, which is why when you look at our ad improvements and our revenue improvements, I would focus more holistically. We do deeper changes across the board, not just visible changes on the page, and all of that contributes to it. So I do definitely think as the shift to mobile accelerates, we are getting some scale benefits, and that's part of it.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO. Your line is now open.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I was wondering if you could spend a little time talking about the launch of the My Activity site, which I think is an update to the controls that your users have over the use of their data. And, in particular, I'd be interested to hear about the option to opt into greater personalization of ads from across the usership on Google Sites, as I believe that's the first time you've allowed, on an opt-in basis certainly, to have search data be used to target ads elsewhere. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, what you're seeing in terms of early traction of users turning that on and where your expectations for that may be.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Look, we are very focused on giving users better controls, and so we wanted to give users a single place to see and control ad settings. And that will be honored as the user moves across devices. It's completely opt-in. Users are absolutely in control. Consumers and advertisers have come to expect ads to work better across devices, and this new option could help us better deliver on that. So for people who choose to opt in, over time we could make sure they see more relevant ads and fewer annoying ones, so effectively put them in better control of the experience they get, and so I think that helps the whole ecosystem work better. We are in very, very early days, but we're being thoughtful about how we do this for users.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)

Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Great, thanks. I guess two quick questions. First off, we understand that Google Shopping in particular continues to see strong growth, and I was hoping you could add some color on the relative mix or growth rates of TLA [Text Link Ads] contrasting to other ad types along with the adoption of transactional capabilities.
And then, Sundar, I wanted to follow up on some of the conversational voice applications and devices that you have in the pipeline, and more generally how you envision voice really fitting in across the board, across the Google platform. Will this be a centerpiece as you also utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence? I'd like to hear more about your vision for that. Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Let me quickly – on the first one, we don't comment on the relative mix, et cetera, so I'll probably give more color on your second question.
Voice is obviously very, very exciting for us. I mentioned this at I/O. if you look at Android, the Google app on Android in the U.S., 20% of the queries are voice queries. So today in terms of evolving to a conversational assistant, we have a big head start. People do this. We get millions of queries every single day. And it's incredibly exciting to see how people interact with voice differently from text. It's more intuitive. It's more personal, and it's a bit more emotional and an engaging experience for users.
And so I think to do this well requires deep computer science, just understanding what they are saying, the natural language processing involved. These are areas in which we have now been working for over 15 years, and we believe we are the best in class. And so bringing all of that together I think is what will help us do this at scale globally, but it's still very early days in terms of getting the conversational assistant right. You will see us launch this through our products as we go through the second half of this year, and I'm excited to see how users respond to it.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Great, thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, in terms of messaging, you mentioned Allo, your mobile messaging product, and Duo, which is your video messaging product. Why is it important that Google is competitive in mobile messaging? And what gives you the confidence that you could take market share from the other players in the messaging space?
And then, Ruth, in terms of the drivers of YouTube growth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that one of the drivers was buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. I just want to maybe hear a little bit more about that. Why has that been so successful recently, and do you look at that as an incremental forward driver of YouTube revenue growth? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
On your first question, I think messaging is obviously an important area. We approach these areas if you believe we have insights by which we can create something very differentiated for users, that we are actually approaching it in a new and unique way.
The core underlying insight we have is, in the context of mobile and using state-of-the-art machine learning, can we rethink some of the areas for our users? So that's the underlying framework with which we have approached this space of being really enjoying using these products, and we'll get it out to users soon. For example, I think if you take something like Duo today, I think especially on Android, high-quality messaging is an experience that's still lacking for users, so we clearly see an opportunity there. And it's at the core of our mission, bringing information experiences to users. And so that's why we are investing and we are optimistic about this space.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And I think on the other part of your question, I think the key point is we've talking about programmatic for quite some time. We're just seeing strong momentum across the board, and we continue to benefit from that.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Sundar, can you broadly discuss the Google hardware strategy and perhaps some of the lessons learned from previous Google hardware launches? And then relatedly, can you just discuss a little bit about how you're thinking the auto strategy? Do you build your own vehicles, license technology? How do you determine which direction to take there and how long until we might see any auto-related revenue? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
On our overall hardware strategy, we've always, we have done devices like Nexus or Google Pixel, et cetera. We realize a lot of computing innovations happen at the intersection of hardware and software. And as we are building ecosystems and broad platforms, we need a way to drive them forward. And so that's the context in which we do.
There are areas where we have done it very seriously. Chromecast is a great example. We now have over 30 million Chromecast devices sold, and that's an example of where we invest deeply. And especially as newer areas emerge like Google Home, we want our ability to put the best experience possible in front of our users and guide the ecosystem. So that's how we think about it. We are being much more thoughtful in how we approach it, and we're building a world-class team so that we can do this for our users. But we are very thoughtful about how we approach it, and we make sure to work with the ecosystem to accomplish what we are trying to do.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And then on cars, self-driving cars is in our Other Bets area, so just a brief update there. We're now testing in four cities, Mountain View, Austin. Most recently we expanded to Kirkland, Washington and to Phoenix. We've self-driven over 1.6 million miles. And the focus here for us is we're solving a really big need, safety, access, and city efficiency.
The other thing that's really motivating for us is when you look at over 30,000 car deaths in the U.S. alone, that's what really inspired the founders to start working on this issue. And our approach is quite different from most others. We're focused on fully-autonomous cars because in early testing we saw the risk of depending on drivers to remain engaged once you give them the option to switch off. So we've invested a lot there. We're testing extensively based on this approach. And more specifically to your question, we're pleased to be working with FCA to advance the development of the self-driving cars. With them, we're more than doubling the number of cars that we have, but we do have huge respect for the expertise required, so we do expect we'll work with many partners in this area.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Thank you, a couple questions. First on YouTube, just thinking about premium content, a lot of activity with streaming deals out there. Obviously, YouTube would be a natural place for streaming content, but even professionally developed content. Do you think you're letting an opportunity get by? How do you think about that?
And then, Ruth, I know you had a lot of experience dealing with regulatory agencies in your last CFO role. There have been some new filings. Can you talk at all about how Google is thinking about that right now? Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So I'll start on the second question. Look, we continue to work constructively with regulators. We don't have an update on timing on any of those specific issues. But the main points in our view are that regulators have found that our businesses do help consumers. And the key mantra here is if we do the right thing for the user, all else will follow.
With respect to consumers, we continue to invest in innovative opportunities that create great experiences and improve their lives. And we're empowering small businesses globally by providing greater reach to customers, not just in their towns, but across countries and around the world. And in our discussions, one of the very important points is we operate in a very vibrant, competitive environment, and we're also proud of the fact that we're investing meaningfully in the ecosystem. For example, Android has helped foster a remarkable and sustainable ecosystem of manufacturers and app developers and entrepreneurs based on open source software and open innovation. That's really the thrust of it, and the emphasis is we're continuing to work constructively with regulators, no additional update.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
And, Justin, on the livestreaming question, I already mentioned that livestream is a big focus for us. We've been at it for a while, and we've built a great, robust, and mature platform for big events. We just announced at VidCon our plans to make mobile livestreaming features available within our core YouTube app on all mobile devices. Our stream time, livestream time has increased 3x since the beginning of the year alone. And YouTube is the first major platform to support live content in 360 degrees. And recent examples, even the RNC in the DNC conventions, they have been livestreamed on YouTube in 360. So there's a lot of momentum there and we are absolutely committed to this space.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the U.S. It accelerated pretty nicely. Any specific buckets of advertisers or any of the innovative products that you'd call out as driving that acceleration in the quarter?
And the second one, Sundar, you talked about using machine learning for better suggestions on YouTube. Can you help us all think about what the level of engagement is on YouTube right now, whether it's minutes or maybe growth in images? How do we think about engagement on YouTube now? Thanks.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So in terms of the U.S., the 25% year-on-year growth reflects strength across products. There's really nothing to call out. It's modest acceleration consistent with what we saw overall, but it's really about Mobile Search.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
On YouTube, at a high level I would say we don't have any new metrics. But on mobile alone, as I've said before, we reach more 18-to-34 and 18-to-49s than any other TV network, broadcast or cable. And every indication we see is that the growth is very, very strong, being driven by mobile, and it's growing globally as well. So overall, I think engagement is very, very healthy. I'm pretty excited about it.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, thanks.

As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks. Our very strong revenue of $20.3 billion in Q1 underscored the great momentum of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth again accelerating meaningfully, up 23% in constant currency versus last year.
The primary driver was the increased use of Mobile Search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the Mobile Search experience. We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising.
We continue to rationalize our portfolio of products to ensure we efficiently and effectively focus our resources behind our biggest bets across Alphabet. I will present to you in the following order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets; finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, total revenue was $20.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $762 million or $593 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23% year-over-year and declined 4% sequentially, reflecting holiday seasonality.
Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe as well as the impact that currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business.
U.S. revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $9.4 billion and down 9% versus Q4. UK revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $1.9 billion and flat sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 21% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 14% versus last year to $9 billion and down 2% versus Q4.
In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 25% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. GAAP other cost of revenues were $3.9 billion. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.6 billion, up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and hardware costs related to sales of new Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel devices launched in the fall.
GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6 billion or 30% of revenue, up 11% year-over-year and down 9% versus Q4. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by R&D expense, mainly due to compensation expense related to head count growth.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.3 billion, up 20% versus last year. The operating margin was 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 21% versus last year. The operating margin was 34%.
With respect to stock-based compensation, it totaled $1.5 billion, up 24% year-over-year, and up 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased head count and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every two years. Head count at the end of the quarter was 64,115, up approximately 2,300 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers in areas where we've prioritized investment, such as cloud and apps. On a numbers basis, we're adding more head count in Google, while on a percentage basis, we're growing faster in Other Bets.
Other income and expense was negative $213 million. As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items with different drivers, which makes it inherently unpredictable. The key drivers this quarter were the ongoing drag from foreign exchange, given the volatility in currency markets as well as losses recorded for marketable and non-marketable securities. These items offset interest income from our investment portfolio, which remains fairly consistent.
Our effective tax rate was 18%, reflecting the geographic mix of our income and adoption of a new accounting standard that reflects certain SBC tax benefits in GAAP earnings that were previously recognized in equity. We have excluded these benefits in our non-GAAP earnings.
Net income was $4.2 billion on a GAAP basis and $5.2 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $6.02 on a GAAP basis and $7.50 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $7.7 billion, with free cash flow of $5.2 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $75.3 billion, of which approximately $45 billion, or 60%, is held overseas. This reflects our strong operating cash flow, offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $2.1 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment, revenue was $20.1 billion, up 17% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $14.3 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile Search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad formats and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year. We continue to have solid growth from desktop and tablet search.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from app promotion.
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year and down 11% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional network businesses.
Other revenue for Google was $2.1 billion, up 24% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Year-over-year performance was driven by Play as well as continued strong growth in cloud and apps and a nice contribution from hardware.
Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. As a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $3.8 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 13% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. The increase in both Sites TAC and Network TAC as a percentage of revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Operating income, excluding SBC, was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year, for an operating margin of 38%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 25% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.3 billion, up 21% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. CapEx for the quarter was $2 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
Turning to Other Bets financials, as a reminder, the majority of these efforts are pre-revenue. We continue to invest across these opportunities, doing so in a disciplined way. Because Other Bets results aggregate the revenues and expenses from a number of businesses operating in different industries, there is likely to be lumpiness in the reported results from quarter-to-quarter, which is why we think it remains most instructive to look at them over a longer time horizon.
For Q1, Other Bets revenue was $166 million, up 108% versus last year. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Verily and Fiber. Operating loss, excluding SBC, was $657 million in the first quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $802 million. Other Bets CapEx was $280 million in Q1, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business.
Look forward, a few observations, first, regarding revenue; our culture of innovation drives our strong revenue growth. We've talked previously about the benefits from changes made to ad formats and delivery in the third quarter of 2015 and that continues to be a tailwind. Mobile, as an example, continues to offer sizable opportunity for revenue enhancement, given the increasing ubiquity of mobile use by consumers and the strong location and contextual signals from mobile devices. Although we remain intensely focused on innovation across Alphabet, the timing and magnitude of ongoing changes, obviously, are inherently uncertain and are not designed with an eye toward quarterly schedules.
Second, as to expenses; within Google, we continue to be focused on managing the expenses that we can actually control, as you can see from our results again this quarter. However, the secular trends driving revenue are accompanied by greater required investment in our ecosystem to support that revenue growth, most specifically the continued trend of higher TAC due to an ongoing change in mix within our Sites and Network businesses.
Third, regarding CapEx; as we have consistently said, technical infrastructure is a key strategic asset for us. We have tremendous scale and continue to add to it. The team continues to deliver innovative solutions that are creating meaningful efficiencies in machine use, allowing us to benefit from earlier investments and meet our growing Google requirements cost effectively.
With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, the bulk of that is directed to our Fiber business, where CapEx should obviously increase as we execute in a growing number of cities.
Fourth, about our balance sheet; as I discussed on our Q4 call, last quarter, we initiated steps to align our capital structure consistent with the move to Alphabet, providing greater flexibility as we continue to grow. Our exchange offer will be completed on April 25, and we have completed the move of our commercial paper and revolving credit facility from Google to Alphabet.
Finally, our strategic prioritization; as I indicated last quarter, there are a number of different execution paths we are pursuing to optimize our investments and opportunities. In some areas, we will be increasing investment if teams meet milestones we set as part of our 2016 budgeting process. In other areas, we've chosen to work with industry-leading partners who can increase our momentum.
Finally, in certain areas where we have had multiple teams developing different approaches to a similar technology, we've been evaluating how to rationalize these approaches, enabling us to increase investments around a smaller, more focused set of opportunities.
So my closing comment is that in Q1, we continued to see tremendous revenue growth across our businesses, and we remain focused on disciplined investing for the long-term.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Thanks, Ruth. It's great to join you all today. Our teams are off to a great start this year and there is even more excitement in the month ahead as we gear up for big events, like: our annual developer conference, Google I/O; our YouTube event, Brandcast; and the Google Performance Summit for advertisers.
Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And after 17 years, we have just scratched the surface of what's possible. We are reinvigorated around this mission and, as you will hear, we are making solid progress across many of our products.
Today, I'll quickly share a few highlights from the quarter, as well as some of the areas where we are investing to make our products more useful and intelligent. Then, I'll give an update on our Advertising business and our growing Cloud business.
A few highlights from the quarter; we continued to invest in making Search more useful and assistive. In the early days, when you did a search on your desktop, we gave you 10 blue links then sent you on your way. Users still had to do too much work to find the information they were looking for. We have made a lot of improvements over the years to add more comprehensive and assistive information right within the search results.
For instance, 10 years ago, if you tried to find the score during your favorite soccer team's match, we'd likely point you to some news articles or the team's website. Today, we show the live scores for nearly 200 soccer leagues across 70 countries, so fans around the world can quickly find information, like upcoming schedules, team news and conference standings right in the search results. We are incredibly well-positioned to better assist our users, thanks to our strengths in areas like search, geographical information, machine learning, image recognition and natural language processing.
One of the key ingredients behind this push towards greater assistance is AI. We have long invested in building the best machine learning team and tools, and we are seeing these efforts bear fruit in many ways. As many of you saw last month, DeepMind's AlphaGo has been making great strides. It was a privilege to play legendary Go player, Lee Sedol, in such an important milestone for artificial intelligence. This is another step to what's creating AI that could help us with everything from our daily tasks to potentially even bigger challenges like climate change and cancer diagnosis.
At Google, machine learning is already helping us improve our products every day in search and many other areas like photos, maps and more. Last quarter, I talked about how machine learning helps Smart Reply suggest responses in Inbox. This quarter, we launched Goals in Google Calendar, an intelligent feature that helps users make the most of their time. You just add a personal goal, like run three times a week, and Calendar will help you find the time, then help you stick it to. There's still a lot more that we can do to make Search and other Google services more assistive and helpful to you. You'll see a lot more from us this year.
On the content side, we are seeing great traction on Google Play and YouTube. YouTube still has incredible momentum, and we continue to invest heavily here. What seemed like a moon shot a decade ago has grown into a booming community of engaged users, creators and brands, unlike any other video platform. YouTube on mobile alone now reaches more 18 to 34 and 18 to 49 year olds in the U.S. than any TV network, broadcast or cable.
This past quarter, we launched YouTube Originals, original content available on our premium service YouTube Red. And we are very pleased with how it's been going. And earlier this week, we announced that we are make 360-degree live streaming available globally on YouTube. We are kicking things off by live streaming select performances at Coachella for fans around the world in 360 degrees.
Google Play remains a thriving hub for digital content across apps, games, music, movies, TV and books. Game developers of all sizes are building successful businesses in the Play Store thanks to its global reach of over 1 billion users. In fact, in 2015, we saw 50% more games reach over 1 million installs compared to the previous year. And we keep adding great content to Google Play. For instance, performances by artists like Coldplay and Justin Bieber from the 2016 BRIT Awards that are available exclusively on Google Play Music.
When we talk about great content, the mobile web is equally important. This quarter, our simple, fast and secure browser, Chrome, reached another important milestone, surpassing 1 billion monthly active users on mobile alone. And, of course, one of the keys to a great mobile experience is fast content. As you know, we have teamed up with hundreds of publishers and tech companies to improve the mobile web for everyone with accelerated mobile pages. Early data shows that these pages load four times faster and use 10 times less data than traditional pages.
We recently made it easy to find AMP in relevant Mobile Search and Google News results, giving users a lightning-fast reading experience for top stories. And there are great advertising opportunities for publishers in these new fast pages.
Another example is progress of Web Apps, which combine the best of the web and apps allowing companies to build mobile sites that load quickly, send push notifications, have home screen icons and much more.
Of course, computing is the foundational layer through which all our products are delivered. In March, we previewed the Android N release to give developers an early look at what's coming in the next version of our software. This release has key features like multi-window support, direct-reply notifications and battery efficiencies.
We're also building for future platforms. We expanded Android Auto to Brazil, and Android Wear partners, like Michael Kors and Fossil, also announced that they are working on new devices coming later this year. In our newest platform, VR, we also recently introduced VR view, a quick and easy way for developers to include 360-degree VR images and videos in their apps and websites.
Now, moving on to some of the key drivers and trends in our advertising business; as people turn to their mobile phones in moments of high intent, which we call micro moments, Google has a compelling value proposition. We offer marketers four things: the best ways to target commercial intent at the right moment; the best mobile ad formats; the best reach and range of quality inventory; and the leading measurement solutions.
First, thanks to our unique interim signals, we are able to connect marketers with the right customer precisely the right time. A new example of this is Customer Match, which helps brands reach their most valued customers on Google Search, YouTube and Gmail, with highly relevant and targeted ads. After using Customer Match to reactivate their loyal customers, specialty retailer Williams-Sonoma reported a 50% lift in revenue compared to previous campaigns that didn't use Customer Match.
Second, we continue to invest in the best new mobile ad formats, tailored to help users find exactly what they need at the right moment. For example, we rolled out Model Automotive Ads, which helps automakers recreate the showroom experience by featuring images of cars alongside helpful information right in the Mobile Search results. On average, participating brands see a more than 30% increase in engagement rate with these new automotive ads compared to standard text ads.
Third, we provide advertisers with the best reach in inventory across many of the web's most coveted platforms. Marketers like HBO Now are seeing great results from our popular app (23:10) promotion offerings like Universal App Campaigns, (23:13) which helps advertisers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search and across our Display network. In fact, in January, we saw a 200% year-over-year increase in ad-driven installs on Android alone.
And in our burgeoning Programmatic business, we recently rolled out Programmatic Guaranteed, a new way to conduct better deals between advertisers and publishers on high quality inventory.
And fourth, we give marketers powerful measurement tools, so they know exactly how effective their ads are. Just this week, we announced the availability of sales lift studies to help consumer packaged brands better understand how their online videos are driving offline sales. This adds to our significant efforts in this area.
I want to specifically highlight the success we are seeing with YouTube advertising. As YouTube continues to grow, with great content and engaged users, marketers can't get enough. For example, Microsoft Xbox hosted a six hour live streamed event on YouTube for their Halo 5 opening week promoted with TrueView ads where 8 million people tuned in, helping it break sales records.
Excitement is especially high as we head into our annual Brandcast event coming up next month. Thanks to the success of Google Preferred, this is the third year in a row we are making it the cornerstone of our offering to marketers. In fact, number of brands in the U.S. using Google Preferred has doubled year-over-year.
Now, I want to spend time on our exciting Enterprise businesses, which have been gaining momentum. Last December, we have unified our cloud businesses under one leader, so we can innovate faster and better serve our customers. This decision is already paying off. Enterprises are starting to see the power of combining Google Cloud Platform with our suite of business applications, all of which are infused with our machine learning services.
As companies accelerate their move to the cloud, we can help them automate their IT operations, better understand their data, and become more cost effective and secure, while also offering them transformative office productivity.
In addition, we are helping customers adopt our powerful Chromebooks and Android phones. Our recent Next 2016 Conference in San Francisco showed just how serious we are about the enterprise. It was wonderful to hear executives from Spotify and Coca-Cola share their stories about how they are benefiting from Google's cloud technology, including our best-in-class security, reliability and analytics. We also introduced Cloud Machine Learning, which provides modern machine learning services with pre-trained models such as Cloud Vision API and Cloud Speech API.
Our growth was accelerating going into that event, and since then, the quantity and quality of our enterprise conversations has risen to a whole new level. Now, we are investing and building our go-to-market activities to ensure we have the right expertise available for each of our business customers.
We are enabling service partners to assist customers with everything from migrating to the cloud to using machine learning to understanding their data. We are providing engineering to help them architect solutions, and we building out our support teams.
We are also helping businesses migrate to our suite of productivity applications like Gmail, Docs and Drive, and customers love them. And we continue to accelerate our innovation in this area with new announcements, such as Smart Reply and Voice Typing. It's gratifying to see the immensely positive response from our customers and partners, who recognize that we offer a powerful combination that's unique to Google: unmatched product innovation, combined with world-class security and reliability; technical transparency; and customer orientation.
To close, as I said before, Google's mission is, and has always been, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. As I think about all our businesses and each of the countries we reach, I have never been more excited about how our teams continue to bring this mission to life and make technology available for everyone.
I've been so proud to see us expanding our core products to more and more countries around the world: Street View in Sri Lanka; YouTube in Nepal and Pakistan; new Hindu keyboards (27:58) in India; and a new engineering center in Singapore that will help us get closer to the next billion users coming online by developing products that will work well for them. We are laser-focused on our mission at Google, and I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world who are helping us make it a reality each and every day.
Before we take your questions, Ruth and I wanted to take a moment to pay our respects to Bill Campbell, our very close friend and a mentor to many of us at Google and Alphabet, who sadly passed on Monday. Bill spent endless hours with our founders and our leadership over the years, helping to build our Board of Directors and sustain our culture. He had a very big impact on our company, made us all smile, and inspired many great leaders of the valley. We offer our condolences to Bill's family, and we will miss him.
And with that, I'll hand it back over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
We'll now turn it back to the operator for questions. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions, maybe just two, one on YouTube; you've now played around with the idea of original content, also injected a subscription offering into the marketplace. What have you learned from the early days of original content and a subscription offering and how that might allow YouTube to evolve and change over time as a product offering?
And second, with respect to the Advertising business, I was curious if there were any verticals or geographies that you might call out as either strengths or weaknesses in the Advertising business during Q1. Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Thanks, Eric. On YouTube, we are definitely excited by the successful roll-out of YouTube Red. It's been very well received. We've really focused on our creators and partners, so hopefully you've caught some of our YouTube Originals. We have released six so far, which are available to YouTube Red members. So early indications are that this is something that's going to resonate well with users, and we are working on a lot more original content throughout the year. And we'll see how it goes.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And then in terms of your question on the regions, as I tried to make clear in my opening comments, what we saw was real strength across the board. I think you could see that from the growth rates, with U.S. up 21% year-over-year, and that was really strength across products. UK, we're really pleased with the team. We continue to see great execution there. On a fixed FX basis, as I noted, up 21%. The biggest contributor to growth in the UK was Mobile Search. And then rest of world growing at 25% on a fixed basis. That's about in line with last quarter. We continue to be really pleased with the growth we're seeing there. In addition to the ongoing contribution from Mobile, the rest of world also benefited from Play and then really nothing to note with respect to verticals.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi. I have two quick questions, first on margins. Despite the increasing TAC as a percentage of revenues, adjusted operating income margins expanded now almost 130 bps and 140 bps for Google year-on-year. Can you help us understand, even if roughly, how much of this margin expansion is specific to the quarter, like due to FX, versus systemic or secular, so to speak?
And the second question, I think maybe for Sundar, can you talk a bit about the decision you took last year to have an additional ad on Mobile Search response pages relegating organic results below the fold? How is it good for the user experience to have ad instead of organic? And if it is good, what does it say about the potential for innovation in organic search? Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Carlos. So starting on the margin question, you've hit a couple of the components, so I'm going to try and just break it down into the drivers on cost of sales versus OpEx more broadly, as you asked it. So on the cost of sales or the gross margin trend, as I tried to make clear, certain costs associated with revenue are going up, given secular trends in the market, so in Sites, Mobile carries higher TAC than does desktop and Mobile remains a strong growth driver, so we do expect this to continue. And then on the network side, we have strong growth in programmatic and that carries higher TAC than traditional ad buying. The obvious result is more revenue and gross margin dollars, but at a lower margin.
And then on OpEx more broadly, we remain very committed to long-term revenue growth and profit. As we've talked about on prior calls, we did set priorities in the 2016 budget and we made some tough choices because our aim is to be as efficient and effective as possible with investment dollars, while properly funding the big opportunities that we have that are reflected in OpEx.
So as I've repeatedly said, some of the biggest bets are in Google. Sundar commented quite a bit on cloud. That's an exciting opportunity. We want to continue to add head count to drive growth. And all of this is consistent with our goals of driving long-term growth in revenue and profit. So it goes to my opening comments that we're focused on controlling the expenses we have, and then there are certain trends, as I noted, in particular on the TAC side, that have been increasing with the strong growth we're seeing in mobile and programmatic.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
And, Carlos, on the ad side, we are incredibly sensitive to the user experience on Search. And so we are constantly evolving how we display ads, but we take a very long-term view. Our ads quality efforts, these are people who have been working on this for many, many years and they are squarely focused on optimizing for positive metrics across users and advertisers. So our utmost focus is making sure, for users, these changes have a positive impact. And mobile is an entirely different paradigm and so a lot of things are counter-intuitive. So, for example, users are very comfortable swiping on mobile. So we deeply think about these things, and I'm very comfortable about how we are planning this for the very long-term.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Ruth, I just had one question, a follow-up from a previous one on the regions. So the U.S. had greater than expected seasonal downtick. It was down 9% quarter-on-quarter. And I know that you picked up Yahoo and lost AOL from 4Q to 1Q. So is that the primary driver of that or as YouTube becomes a bigger percent of your revenue, should we expect greater seasonal uptick in 4Q and seasonal downtick in 1Q? Can you just give us a little bit more color on what's driving that? Thanks.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, we, as you know, don't comment on any particular partner. So all I can add here is that the deceleration quarter-on-quarter does reflect holiday-related seasonality, which we did call out last quarter, and you see that in a number of the products.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. You talked about TAC rising because of the increasing mix shift towards mobile and programmatic. There seems like there was a little bit of an extra bump up this quarter. Would there have been any one major renewal of a deal that would have caused that? It did seem to spike more than what you would get, I assume, if you just rolled out mobile and programmatic. And then any commentary at all on Nest; there seemed to be an unusual amount of press since intra-quarter on troubles with that asset? Could you just comment on qualitatively how the asset is doing? Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So on TAC, it's really the ongoing growth in Mobile, as I've kind of answered a couple of times here, and that reflects the strong secular trends behind mobile, so really nothing to add on on the Sites TAC side. And then on the network side, again, it's really the higher TAC that we're seeing on programmatic, so nothing really to call out.
And then with respect to your question on Nest, I guess what I'll add there is Nest products are best-sellers in the category. It's a leading brand in the connected home. It's obviously early, but a very exciting category. And as we've talked about, our Other Bets are all very early stage, but continues to be best-seller in the category.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you. This question is for Sundar. It's multi-part, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your cloud ambitions? And wondering what do you see as the biggest changes in strategy post Diane Greene's appointment? And then, how are you getting enterprise customers to think of you as having enterprise DNA, if you will, which is something that took Amazon a long time to get. And I guess lastly, just if you could just help us think about which type of workloads do you see Google as being the most competitive for at this time? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Thanks, Heather. Obviously, I talked about it a lot in my prepared remarks. And we have already had a lot of momentum in this area. And in many ways, given the scale at which we have done this internally for us, we view it as an area we are very competent at. What Diane has brought to us to is a deep understanding of how to think about what enterprises need and adapt to it in a very detailed and nuanced way. And you saw the momentum at the Next Conference, which she hosted.
We are getting a lot more inbound. We are in much deeper conversations than we have ever been before. We do think we are competent across a range of work flows. And areas where we view we will be uniquely capable over time is, because of our machine learning capabilities, helping enterprises really understand their data, understand how best they can do what their core competency is and really revolutionize around that. It's early days and it's a long-term investment. But bringing our machine learning APIs over time through cloud to our enterprise customers is going be a huge source of differentiation for us.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Two things; first, Sundar, I was hoping you could comment more on Mobile Search pricing, in particular it gets a little bit lost just within overall pricing per-click, especially with YouTube in there. So I was hoping you could comment on pricing on more of a like-for-like basis. And as inventory perhaps stabilizes some, would you expect pricing here to increase over time as conversion improves? And then secondly, Ruth, if you could just comment a little bit more on other income and just help us understand some of the details there on the negative number in that line? Thanks.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So I'll take those. In terms of the first question, there's obviously some data, as I referenced, attached with the press release. And, as you know well, all of the monetization data reflects a host of factors, from geographic mix and device mix and property mix, as well as it's all on a floating FX basis. And clearly, FX is a contributor. I think you're trying to get more color on Mobile. And what's hopefully clear from the opening comments, is that Mobile continues to outperform. Desktop growth did pick up modestly in Q1, but, from opening comments, should be clear that Mobile Search revenue was up significantly.
And then in terms of your question on other income, let me point you to the OI&E table that's at the end of our press release. This line consists of a number of different items. They can be affected by different trends, but you can see the breakout in that table, which hopefully is helpful there.
Interest income has been fairly consistent. We do continue to manage our portfolio conservatively. FX is consistently an expense here. It was slightly elevated again this quarter, given the ongoing volatility in foreign exchange markets. We haven't changed our approach to hedging, but up with volatility in the markets. And then the OI&E line also includes changes in value where equity pickups related to marketable and nonmarketable securities and investments. We appreciate with all those different line items it's tough to forecast, but you can see the detail attached to the press release.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Thank you. So, Sundar, I think it was at I/O last year when you started to call out the products which have over 1 billion users. At this point, are you able to elaborate on what percent of these users have either a Google ID or are known users for you?
And, Ruth, kind of a housekeeping, I guess, item on the CapEx here. When you talk about CapEx with the Other Bets being primarily for Fiber, is this a fairly sort of straightforward passing of homes, or is your cash use going toward developing new technologies or products like SkyBender? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Steven, on the first question, maybe I can add more color this way. So user base is scaling most, you know, we are also seeing tremendous shift towards Mobile. It's in many of these products. We are already over 50% of these users are coming from Mobile. And in Mobile typically, all users are signed in. And so I think over time as the shift continues, I think we have a user base which is signed in. And so that's the way we think about it.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And then on the CapEx question, if I just broaden that a bit, the CapEx trends in part is efficiency, in part is timing when you look at year-over-year spend. Compared to last year, we had some outsized machine spend that filled some recently constructed data centers. And as we've consistently said, our technical infrastructure is a really key strategic asset for us. We have tremendous scale. We continue to add to it, and the team has done an extraordinary job innovating to deliver some meaningful efficiencies in machine use. And that enables us to benefit from earlier investments.
And although you asked about the Fiber side, just to build off of what Sundar was saying on cloud, given what a strategic priority that is for us, and the requirements for a leading cloud business are clearly at the core of all that we do and at a scale that's unmatched, given our sustained investments in infrastructure.
One of the things that was also mentioned at Next is that we plan to add 12 new regions. And to be clear, we're going to be using multiple execution paths for those data center requirements. In other words, every cloud region isn't necessarily going to be housed in a Google data center. So we don't need to build data centers in all of these places. They will all incorporate the same Google hardware and software and meet the same performance, reliability and security requirements. And investing in cloud isn't only about CapEx. We also put a lot of head count behind that again this quarter.
And then more specifically on the Fiber side, as you were pointing to, we do expect that to increase throughout the year as we execute on the cities that we've already announced. It's primarily about continuing to execute on those cities. We now are up to 22 announced cities, two most recent announcements being some buildings. We're bringing fiber to like buildings in San Francisco and we're working with the City of Huntsville. That being said, I liked your question because we're also very focused on innovation and technology. And so it's really both, but predominantly continued execution against these cities that we've announced.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a few questions on YouTube; first, on the Preferred program, Ruth, you mentioned it sounds like the growth continues to be really strong there going into Brandcast. And I was just curious, is the program now formally rolled out globally? And then I've got one follow-up on Red.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So in terms of Preferred, you're right. I did note that the strong revenue growth there is driven virtually exclusively by video. That's TrueView and increasingly Google Preferred, and, as we said, nice ad (45:29) promotion there as well.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
And it's largely rolled out in major markets and we'll continue to do that.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay, great. And then just a quick one on Red, it seems as if the direction for the content remains to focus on your own originals right now. What may or may not make you consider looking at other licensed, maybe more traditional, TV or film content?
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Well, I mean, look, we are going to approach it comprehensively. And we have obviously had great early traction with the six original series we have released so far. This year, we are on track to release 15 to 20 original series or films coming up. (46:11) And so I think that's an exciting direction we will pursue, but, at the same time, we'll keep an open mind about all other revenues as well.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay, great. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. I have a few. First, for Sundar, could you talk about the cloud, why really get more aggressive now? We've been riding on it for many years, and just wondering why now really ramping up the investment? And how would you characterize the margins or the returns on capital in that business? Why is that interesting for you?
And then maybe for Ruth, you know, you give us a lot of detail on click growth, but I'm just wondering if you can help us all on query growth, just how that's trended since Mobile really took off? Is it growing? How is it trending? And do you have more room to monetize, given where your ad coverage is now? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Just on the first one, I would say there are three points of inflection for us, and that's why we are really ramping it up. The first is we've always been doing cloud. It's just that we were consuming it all internally at Google, but as we have grown, really matured in terms of how we handle our data center investments and how we can do this at scale, we have definitely crossed over to the other side where we can thoughtfully serve external customers. So that's the first point of inflection.
The second point of inflection for us is as we've been investing in machine learning and AI for years, but I think we are at an exceptionally interesting tipping point where these technologies are really taking off. And that is very, very applicable to businesses as well, and so thoughtfully doing that externally, we view as a big differentiator we have over others.
And third, is definitely Diane Greene coming in. And I think I wanted to (48:12) scale our efforts here thoughtfully when it is set up with a great leader who understands this space deeply. And so those are the three main reasons why we are significantly ramping up what we are doing there.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And then on query growth, we don't really talk about query growth. As Sundar said, focused on answers; there are a lot of new ways to search on mobile, of course, voice, et cetera. So let me try and actually add a little more on your question on cloud.
We've consistently said it's early days. You asked about ROIC. We're really excited about the magnitude of the opportunity, as Sundar has talked about. And one thing that's really powerful here is we're benefiting from our heritage, from our differentiated strength, the scale of our infrastructure. Those are investments we've made over many years that give us extraordinary efficiency. We have robust security. Again, we've invested over many years. We have unparalleled machine learning. And so really, when we think through to the ROIC opportunity compelling building on investments that we've made and continue to make and a very exciting opportunity.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First, for Sundar on Google Fiber, just at a higher level, would you please broadly update us on your learnings from Google Fiber up until this point? And what are the goals that Google is trying to achieve with Google Fiber in terms of longer-term ambitions in terms of TV or video distribution?
And then, Ruth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Mobile Search being driven by improvements in ad formats and delivery starting in the third quarter of last year. Is there any way to frame or think about what Sites revenue growth might be on a recurring basis if you try to exclude the impacts or benefits from the changes in formats that you mentioned and as we start to think about the year-over-year growth comparisons there for the back half of 2016? Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So let me go ahead and start on the Fiber question. Fiber is one of the businesses that is in Other Bets. And like all of our access efforts, we're really focused. And our vision here is to create abundant and ubiquitous networks. We think there's a lot of opportunity to improve the experience that users have, and that's where the Fiber team is focused. And we have some other efforts within Other Bets that are really exciting as well that address access. Loon within our X business is targeting the 4 billion people still offline. And we view that similarly as a big opportunity and an important problem to address.
And in terms of the early learnings, there have been a lot. As I talked about on the last quarter call, we've really continued to refine and enhance our go-to-market strategy, the way we're working with cities, the way we're building out those cities and really the level of technology and innovation that we can use to differentiate the offering and are pleased with the ongoing efforts there.
And then in terms of the change in ad format, as we've talked about on a lot of calls, innovation is core to all we do. It obviously happens on its own timeline. We have a culture of it. We're continuously focused on it. I'm not going to break out impact for any change. We're constantly looking to innovate and improve the user experience. And so there was a step-up, which we've talked about, and we continue to look at other ways, as Sundar talked about, to continue to enhance the user experience. But I think the most important point and somewhat implicit in your question, that shouldn't take away from the very strong underlying revenue and revenue growth that we have in that business.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just on Mobile Search and the mobile ad format changes in 3Q of last year, could you just help us? Were those changes made globally last year in the third quarter? And if not, how should we think about when they will go globally or how you're kind of phasing those changes?
And then, the second one on the desktop, Ruth, you mentioned that desktop growth picked up in the first quarter. What drove that pickup in growth and any learnings from the change in the right-hand rail in the first quarter? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
The launch which you're talking about was global. So we've been doing these changes for a long time and so we try to roll it out globally, and that's what we did.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And then, in terms of the desktop format change, so we had a modest benefit from that change where, just to be clear for all, we reduced the ad load by removing ads on the right-side of the screen while adding a fourth ad slot for highly commercial queries in the aggregate. That resulted in a cleaner, more useful, presentation and improved user experience. It was a modest impact, but additive.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Hi, guys, a few questions. Sundar, your commentary on Play focused on games, but what needs to happen to have more verticals beyond games become meaningful? And then, Ruth, a couple more on the Sites TAC, at a high level, how do average TAC rates differ on mobile versus desktop? And aside from the TAC rates, are there any other notable contractual issues that differ meaningfully between mobile and desktop search partnerships? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Yeah, Ben, on the first question, I think that's a good question. We are seeing traction across categories. It's just that games are at a much larger scale, but, for example, when we get into education, we see if you view that as a vertical, we do see traction there and so on. So I think taking a very long-term view, it will probably reflect they're all, there are commercial opportunities across every vertical. But game developers are the savviest developed person in terms of getting ahead of this curve.
Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And on your TAC question, as I've indicated a number of times already on the call, the TAC rate is higher on Mobile. Mobile's growing at a faster rate and what you're seeing here is a mix shift. So there is a delta between the two. But I think, importantly, we are benefiting from an important secular trend behind Mobile, and like the revenue dollars and the gross profit dollars that come as a result of that, and we'll continue to innovate on mobile and are excited about the opportunity, in particular with all the changes that we continue to see in the way users use the phone and the opportunities.

Thank you. And our final question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, great. Thanks very much. Sundar, first off, you mentioned a lot of the ongoing projects at Google, but I wonder if you could share with us maybe the two or three areas that you're spending the most of your time on or are focused on? And related to that, one of the strengths of the company is obviously the strong engineering orientation and ability to hire some of the best talent and acquire the best technology. And the company has been able to adapt very quickly to change, but I wonder which areas of your business demonstrate where Google or Alphabet are really on the forefront of development, pushing innovation rather than adapting to changes you see in the market. Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
Thanks, Colin. On the first thing, obviously, we are doing many things, but I tend to spend my time on the core of, you know, our core product. I think we have a unique opportunity to evolve search to be very assistive in how we serve our users and be an intelligent assistant that helps users throughout their needs in context, especially in the context of mobile. That's an area definitely I spend a lot of time on. And related to that, we do think we can do a lot of that by based on our core advancements in machine learning and AI. So that's an area we invest a lot. And I'm thoughtfully involved with that as well. And third, definitely from a computing standpoint, computing is foundational to everything we do. And so thinking through about how computing evolves, be it emerging technologies like VR or how mobile advances over the next few years, so these are all areas where I do spend time on.
And overall, I do think in the long run, I think we will evolve in computing from a mobile first to an AI first world. And I do think we are at the forefront of development. So we don't view it as adapting to it as much as pushing hard and getting there. And so that's the core of what we do, and we'll continue to do that.

I'll now turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks. Revenue momentum in Q4 underscored the strength of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth accelerating meaningfully versus last year. The primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the efficacy of mobile search as well as from the holiday season. In addition, results reflect ongoing momentum in YouTube and programmatic advertising. There were a number of unusual items in the quarter that I will address during the discussion of results.
With a move to our new Alphabet structure, we conducted a detailed review of business opportunities and investment levels across Google and Other Bets. We made some important decisions to prioritize the allocation of resources and capital to maximize long-term potential within each area. We are pleased to be sharing financial results for each of Google and what we call the Other Bets and thereby provide more visibility into financial trends in each segment.
In light of our move to segment reporting, I'm going to present to you in this order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with key themes for the near term. Sundar will then review our business and products highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial operational performance, total revenue was $21.3 billion, up 18% year over year and up 14% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $1.3 billion, or $1 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 24% year over year and 15% sequentially.
Alphabet revenues by geography also highlight both the strength of our business around the globe as well as the impact the currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business. U.S. revenue was up 24% year over year to $10.3 billion and up 18% versus Q3. UK revenue was up 16% year over year to $1.9 billion and up 7% sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 20% year over year and 9% quarter over quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 12% versus last year to $9.1 billion and up 12% versus Q3. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year over year and up 14% sequentially.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion in Q4, up 24% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs due to the launch of our new Nexus, Chromecast, and Pixel devices.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.6 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year over year and up 15% versus Q3, primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.4 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 25%. Adjusting for stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 32%.
With respect to stock-based compensation, it totaled $1.4 billion, up 20% year over year and flat sequentially, primarily reflecting head count, which was up 15% versus last year and 3% versus 3Q 2015. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers.
Other income and expense similarly included an unusual item this quarter. Specifically, other income and expense was negative $180 million, due primarily to the write-down of securities received in conjunction with the sale of a business, offsetting interest income from the investment portfolio.
Finally, taxes also reflect the impact of certain one-time items in the quarter affecting the U.S. rate. Specifically, taxes reflect the resolution of a multiyear audit in the U.S. as well as the full-year impact in Q4 of the U.S. Congress making the R&D tax credit permanent. Our effective tax rate for the full year, including these one-time items, was 17%.
Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP basis and $6 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.06 on a GAAP basis and $8.67 on a non-GAAP basis.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.4 billion, with free cash flow of $4.3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash and marketable securities balance of approximately $73 billion, of which approximately $43 billion, or 59%, is held overseas.
Our cash balance reflects the impact of seasonal working capital requirements and our repurchase during the quarter of approximately 2.4 million shares of Alphabet Class C stock for a total repurchase amount of $1.8 billion. Our Board of Directors recently authorized a modest increase in the size of the stock repurchase we announced last quarter. You can find the details in our earnings release of the total remaining authorization.
Let me now turn for the first time to our segment financial results. In our earnings release, we are providing key financial metrics for Google on the one hand and the combined Other Bet businesses on the other hand. I will review the results for each segment with respect to revenues, operating income, and CapEx, which I will discuss. You can also find in the release details of stock-based compensation as well as depreciation, amortization, and impairments for Google and the combined Other Bets.
As I go through the Google segment, I'll be providing the same level of detail we've presented in prior periods, both to best assist in comparability relative to prior periods and given the fact that Google continues to represent the overwhelming majority of our results. For Other Bets, I'll be discussing revenue, operating income, and CapEx for the full year. Detail on a quarterly basis is included in the press release.
Keep in mind that Other Bets represents an aggregation of businesses, many of which operate in distinct sectors with different business models. Given their stages of development, these businesses will have idiosyncrasies with respect to the timing of revenue, expenses, and CapEx resulting from milestones, partnerships, and other factors. You can expect that results for the combined Other Bets may be uneven in the near term, so it's likely to be more instructive to look at them on an annual or rolling 12-month basis to assess their trajectory.
Starting with the Google segment, which includes our Search and Ads business as well as related businesses such as Play, Hardware and Cloud and Apps, as well as our newer efforts within Google such as Machine Learning and Virtual Reality, Google revenue was $21.2 billion, up 18% year over year. This reflects the impact of FX.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $14.9 billion in the quarter, up 20% year over year, and up 14% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile Search due to ongoing improvement in ad formats and delivery. As I mentioned previously, we also saw the benefits of consumers' greater use of mobile for shopping during this holiday season.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred. Network revenue was $4.1 billion, up 7% year-on-year and up 12% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of Programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses.
Other revenue for Google was $2.1 billion, up 24% year over year and up 20% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on Other revenue. Year-over-year performance was driven by Play as well as continued strong growth in Cloud and Apps.
Finally, on monetization, as a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 31% year over year and 17% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 13% year over year and 5% sequentially. In terms of the drivers within Sites, paid clicks were up 40% year over year and up 22% sequentially. Site CPCs were down 16% year over year and down 8% sequentially.
The movement in Google Sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube TrueView. Network paid clicks were up 2% year over year and up 1% sequentially. Network CPCs were down 8% year over year and up 7% sequentially. Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.1 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 14% sequentially and up 12% year over year.
As a reminder, the sites TAC line in our earnings release includes the TAC that we paid to search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search. Operating income excluding SBC was $8 billion, up 28% versus last year for an operating margin of 38%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 18% year over year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.8 billion, up 30% versus last year, and the operating margin was 32%. CapEx for the quarter was $1.8 billion, reflecting investments in data center construction, production equipment and facilities. Full-year 2015 Google revenues were $74.5 billion, operating income excluding SBC was $28 billion; operating income including the impact of SBC was $23.4 billion and CapEx was $8.8 billion.
Turning to Other Bets' financials, Other Bets includes efforts such as all we are doing with Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest, self-driving cars, and our incubation activities in X. As discussed previously with respect to Other Bets, we're focused on optimizing resources across this portfolio in the near term, with the objective of maximizing Alphabet's long-term value creation. For the full-year 2015, Other Bets revenue was $448 million, up 37% versus last year. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily.
As noted previously, the majority of efforts within the Other Bets are pre-revenue. On a full-year basis, operating loss excluding SBC was $3.1 billion. As previously noted, these results reflect the impact of project milestones established several years ago. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $3.6 billion. Other Bets CapEx was $869 million for the full-year, primarily reflecting investment in our Fiber business.
Let me conclude with some comments about our continuing transformation of Alphabet. As Larry articulated in the 2013 Founders' Letter, and then, again, when announcing the creation of Alphabet, incrementalism in technology leads to irrelevance over time, because change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. This belief was the impetus for our organizational structure, which enhances focus on opportunities within Google and across Alphabet, while also pushing our leaders to extend the frontier that we are addressing.
Consistent with the move to Alphabet, we expanded transparency internally regarding the expenses and CapEx required in each business, which benefited our 2016 budgeting process and capital allocation decision-making. As part of this process, we established technical and business targets for a number of the businesses to set the appropriate pace of investment. We made necessary choices to align resources with those efforts that maximize the potential for long-term value creation, prioritizing certain efforts, while making tough calls in Others.
Given the fact that we are innovating in a number of exciting industries, in some areas, the optimal execution path could encourage accelerated investment. In Others, we continue to receive interest in exploring partnerships or alternate approaches to commercializing our efforts. Verily is a great example of where we formed strategic partnerships with companies like Dexcom, J&J, Novartis, and Sanofi in order to accelerate our efforts. My main point here is that we remain on a journey, and it is still early days. We are working diligently to build additional businesses that create long-term revenues, profits and value.
Looking forward, a few observations. First, regarding revenue. As a reminder, the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally our strongest quarter, reflecting the benefit of the holidays. In addition, our GAAP results will continue to be affected by changes in the relative strength of the dollar.
Second, operating expenses. As I said last quarter, our priority remains revenue growth, but that doesn't give us a pass on a rigorous approach to expense management. We continue to invest in longer-term opportunities within both Google and Other Bets, consistent with our emphasis on pushing the frontier to adjacent areas and moon shots. Given the early-stage nature of a number of these efforts, they are likely to require additional investment prior to generating meaningful revenues.
Notably, in many ways, some of Alphabet's biggest moon shots are in Google itself, from driving the next wave of computing through machine learning, capitalizing on the shift to the cloud by enterprises, building platforms like virtual reality and pursuing the opportunities we see with the next billion users in emerging markets, you should expect Google to continue to invest in efforts to improve life for billions of people.
Third, CapEx; as we've indicated previously, the vast majority of CapEx supports Google. We view our computing capacity as a core competence and will continue to invest here given our advantages in providing efficient, secure computing to support growth in both our consumer products and services globally as well as our Cloud and Apps businesses. In Other Bets, the majority of CapEx supports the ongoing deployment of Google Fiber. We're still operating in only a few cities, but have announced plans for additional cities, which we expect will be reflected in 2016 CapEx.
Forth, our balance sheet. In 2016, we intend to align our capital structure with the Alphabet organization so that debt is held at the holding company level. That alignment would allow us to have greater flexibility as we continue to grow, including the ability to utilize debt financing, if appropriate, and consistent with our changing product mix.
So my closing comment is that we saw tremendous revenue growth across our businesses and are applying discipline as we move to implement the Alphabet structure.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
Thanks, Ruth. It's great to be here to talk with you all again.
Above all, our Q4 results show the great momentum and opportunity we have in mobile search and across Google's range of businesses. What's most exciting is the incredible enthusiasm for our products among consumers and our partners.
Two things show this. First, on our last call, I shared that six of our consumer products, Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and Google Play, all have over a billion monthly active users each. I'm pleased to share that Gmail now joins those ranks, crossing that number last quarter. Of course, all of these products are very popular and continue to grow rapidly on mobile.
Second, there is incredible momentum behind the Android ecosystem, and the model is working at scale. This is a group of companies with whom we have worked really hard to build strong relationships. At the center of this are Android phones, and it's exciting to see the lineup of flagship devices our partners are working on this year. And there are newer areas, which are showing a lot of promise.
In addition to an Android web partnership with New Balance and a new smartwatch from our friends at Casio, over 40 car brands worldwide are bringing Android Auto to their cars. Dozens of partners are integrating Android TV and Google Cast technology into living room products launching this year.
I want to talk about two main things today. First, some thoughts on the approach we are taking to drive the next wave of innovation, and then, some thoughts on our advertising business and our newer emerging businesses.
First, a few words on our approach. At Google, we've always tried to bring our unique technical strengths to areas where we think we can make a big difference, like indexing the world's information to make it discoverable. We have focused a lot on really improving search in mobile and now we are investing in evolving this to actively assist our users throughout the day in smart and helpful ways. This comes thanks to our years of investments in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, knowledge graph and other areas.
And the next wave will be powered by big advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, an area where we believe we lead the industry. Just last week, DeepMind published an incredible result, the first ever to master the game of Go with artificial intelligence. An amazing accomplishment, and I'm excited for the world championship in March. And in November, we open-sourced TensorFlow, our new machine learning system, to help accelerate discovery and development in the field.
Machine learning is making our products smarter and more useful for people every day. It powers Smart Reply, in Inbox by Gmail, which suggests short responses that are relevant to an incoming email. People absolutely love this feature. In fact, in just a few months, Smart Reply already makes up 10% of all mobile responses in Inbox.
From image recognition in photos to eliminating email spam to better translation and voice recognition, our machine learning efforts are making a huge difference for people every day. In sum, we believe we've only scratched the surface of truly being there for our users anytime, anywhere, across all devices, giving them the assistance they need. We are excited to make even more progress on this vision in 2016.
The second part of our approach is to make sure we are solving big problems for everyone. We believe that someone in Indonesia should get the same quality email service or search results as someone in New York. This quarter I visited Korea, Vietnam, and India to speak with partners, developers, and students. It was a very inspiring trip. I even sat down at a local coffee shop with Dong Nguyen, the creator of the popular Flappy Bird game, which has inspired Vietnam's growing community of developers and startups to think hard about how to create worldwide hits.
From providing Internet access in India's railway stations to making Chromebooks available throughout the region, it reinforced what a huge opportunity we have to help the next 1 billion users come online and to have great experiences with the whole Internet once they are there. That's why creating open platforms that anyone can build on is core to Google's DNA, from Chrome to Android to Brillo to our latest virtual reality efforts.
It's still incredibly early innings for virtual reality as a platform, and Cardboard is just the first step, but we are excited by the progress we have seen. Our partners have shipped over 5 million Google Cardboard viewers, and we recently teamed up with The New York Times on a virtual reality experience in which over 1 million Times subscribers received Cardboard. And since launching in September, the Expeditions Pioneer Program has helped more than 500,000 students travel to places like the bottom of the sea or the surface of Mars. Beyond these early efforts, you'll see a lot more from us and our partners in 2016.
Now turning to the trends and highlights that we are seeing across our advertising business as well as some of the newer areas. It's hard to believe that AdWords just celebrated its 15th birthday. Just like Google Search and the computing devices we all use now, the product is largely unrecognizable from the first version that launched in 2000, but the key value proposition remains unchanged. Google helps advertisers reach the right customer at precisely the right micro-moment when they are looking to buy something, go somewhere, know something, or do something.
Mobile is really helping us making these connections for marketers. As Ruth mentioned, Mobile Search was particularly strong in the fourth quarter. This holiday season, we found that shopping moments replaced shopping marathons. Shoppers turned to their mobile devices to purchase gifts online in spare moments throughout the day all season long, and marketers turned to our mobile ad offerings to reach those customers.
And people are actively buying products when searching on mobile. Our research shows that 30% of all online shopping purchases now happen on mobile phones. In fact, in the U.S., looking just at product listing ads, revenue from mobile phones exceeded desktop on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and through the weekend. Not only were people using mobile ads to shop online, they also used their phones to find the best products and prices in stores around them.
Our local inventory ads help people see if a product they are looking for is in stock at a retailer nearby. Marketers at Lowe's and Target find them useful because they can measure the foot traffic that their search ads drove. In fact, thanks to local inventory ads, Target reported millions of incremental store visits in the week leading up to Christmas.
We also continue to see great success in driving app downloads. Our app promotion offerings like Universal App Campaigns, which help marketers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search, and across our Display Network, are getting great traction and delivering results for advertisers. We are now seeing a trend of advertisers moving their app install budgets to Google.
Now moving to video, people watch hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube every day, and it continues to be a must-have for all brand advertisers. Not only does YouTube on mobile reach more 18 to 49-year-olds than any cable network in the U.S., but the time people spent watching YouTube in the living room more than doubled in 2015.
Brands turn to YouTube to inspire and engage potential customers. And with our recently launched Shoppable TrueView Ads, marketers like Michael Kors can connect the dots between inspiration and purchase. And it is brands of all sizes. In fact, over the last two years, the number of small and medium-sized businesses advertising on YouTube has doubled.
We also continue to expand measurement options for marketers on YouTube to help them better understand the effectiveness of their ad spend. In addition to our own measurement tools, we recently introduced support for third-party viewability vendors on YouTube.
YouTube is also a powerful platform for creators. Today, any creator can upload a video to YouTube and get discovered by over 1 billion people around the world. That global exposure has allowed YouTube and Google to pay out over $3 billion to the record industry to date.
We are also investing in the future of video. You can now watch the VR videos on YouTube, and content creators can now film in new YouTube spaces in Paris and Mumbai.
Between incredibly strong viewership growth, the move of advertising budgets to digital video, great new features, as well as the successful rollouts of YouTube Music and our YouTube Red subscription offering, I couldn't be more excited about the prospects for YouTube in the years ahead.
In programmatic video and display, we continue to see strong momentum. More marketers and publishers use programmatic automated ad buying and tools through our DoubleClick platform this holiday season than ever before. Programmatic video impressions doubled compared to the holiday season last year. And in the week leading up to Black Friday, more than 60% of programmatic impressions came from mobile devices.
Lastly, I'll discuss some of our newer business areas, where we continue to see tremendous potential. Google Play, our hub for digital content, continues to see great momentum. In 2015, spend per buyer in the Play Store grew by more than 30% globally compared to 2014. We had particularly strong growth in this area in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia and Mexico, thanks to continued investments in payments capabilities.
On Hardware, as you know, last quarter, we launched the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P in more than 30 countries. They are truly great examples of the best that Android can offer and have gotten great reviews. And the adoption of Chromebooks continues to gain a ton of momentum, particularly in education.
Before I wrap up, I want to share some thoughts on our Cloud and Apps group. Public Cloud services are a natural place for us, so we established a business unit late last year to take full advantage of the opportunity. I'm excited that Diane Greene, a highly respected industry vet, joined to lead it. As you know, Google pioneered the Cloud at scale. Our data centers have handled the workload of Google's own products from Search to YouTube for 17 years.
We are able to take that infrastructure and computing power and optimize it for all customers. Our data centers, infrastructure, machine learning, and premium data services are leaders in the Cloud space as is our price-to-performance ratio. And we are now able to bring this to bear just as the movement to Cloud has reached a tipping point.
Businesses now see that the easiest-to-use, most price-effective and secure infrastructure can best be obtained through the major public cloud providers. Google cloud platform is already used by more than four million applications. And we recently introduced a new way to purchase and use virtual machines, called Custom Machine Types, so that clients can tailor their purchases based on the memory they need to get the best possible cost and performance.
Our business collaboration and productivity suite, Google Apps, now incorporates the best of Google's new technologies like machine learning and natural language processing. Our adoption now extends from large healthcare providers to retailers, to government. Last quarter, Catholic Health Initiatives, the nation's second largest non-profit health system with more than 100,000 employees, announced its move to Google Apps. There's great buzz at Google around this area, and we continue to heavily ramp up investment here.
I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for their amazing work, from Cloud computing, digital video, and the mobile revolution, to machine learning, virtual reality, and helping the next billion get online. Google has a front row seat on the trends that will define computing in the coming years. There is truly no more exciting place to come to work every day.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hello, thank you for taking my questions. I have a couple. First, Sundar, do you believe there is a non-trivial chance of Google and the DeepMind team achieving strong AI in the next five years or so?
And secondly, on your revenues, can you tell us what do you feel the drivers of Sites revenue growth and what seems to be an acceleration have legs and are more like improving this experience in advertiser returns and less like increasing ad lows, which one could argue have a limited headway? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
Thanks, Carlos. I'll answer the first, and turn it over to Ruth on the second. On AI, we are obviously seeing incredible progress in this field. We make great strides, and we start taking it for granted and look to the years ahead. It's always tough to predict what happens over a five-year timeframe, but I do see us making significant strides. Even a year ago, I wouldn't have predicted that we would be in a strong position to mount a serious challenge to the world champion in Go this year. So looking at the pace of progress, I think we will have AI in a form in which it benefits a lot of users in the coming years, but I still think it's early days, and there's a long-term investment for us.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And then, on Sites' revenue, what the results reflect is, is product strength, geographic breadth, and obviously, the added backdrop of an active holiday season with the Sites' revenue up 20% year-on-year notwithstanding the currency impact. The way we look at it is we've got extraordinary capability and strength in Search, and then ongoing innovation across the platform.
As we talked about last quarter, we did benefit from a change made in Q3 in ad format with respect to mobile search and we do continue to benefit from that change. Mobile search growth was the biggest driver again this quarter. And then, in terms of YouTube, the momentum continues. The story continues to be about strong growth in video advertising, TrueView and Google Preferred as distinct from Display on YouTube. And then, just to round it out, desktop search remains a solid contributor as well.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two on margins now that we have the new disclosure – and thanks for all of that information. With core Google, we saw a very nice operating margin improvement in 2015 versus 2014. Wanted to know if we could get a little bit color on what drove that, whether it was incremental revenue, pricing, cost efficiency, how you sort of think about what drove that? And the opposite for Other Bets, clearly, a bigger loss in 2015 versus 2014. Maybe a little bit of color on the volatility as you called it out, and how that might develop over time. Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Certainly. So starting with Other Bets, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're at the beginning of a journey with the creation of Alphabet and breaking this out into the segments is a meaningful step. As you look at some of the numbers, the reason I said it's more instructive to look at annual or rolling 12 months is that there can be some lumpy things on a quarterly basis, but we're continuing to invest across the businesses as we talked about.
So that would explain the 2014/2015 trend here. It just underscores that we're investing in the business, we've made some tough choices, and as I said, in terms of how we're allocated across the various businesses, but an important area for us and tried to give you the sizing here in the segment information.
And then, in terms of overall Google, we're continuing to invest there as well. We're investing quite meaningfully, as I previously said, the 70-20-10 model is an instructive framework that Larry's articulated for a long time. And as I tried to stress in my opening comments, we're looking to push the frontier both within Google and Other Bets. So ongoing innovation is key to all that we're doing in Google, and it's benefiting users and the ecosystem broadly. So you're continuing to see us invest there, and notwithstanding, that you see the results that you have here today.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thank you. Sundar, thank you for the color on your initiatives with the Cloud, and we're all very excited about Diane Greene's hiring. I was wondering if you could share with us when you were having conversations with corporate customers over the last 12 months, what were the biggest areas of change or things that they said Google needed to work on in order to win over their Cloud business versus, say, them choosing to go with an AWS or an Azure? And can you talk to us about how that change might progress and how we might see that filter through in 2016? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
Thanks, Heather. I'm very excited to have Diane here as well. We are already getting significant traction. It's a strongly growing business for us. And we plan to invest significantly in 2016. It'll be one of our major investment areas. In terms of talking to customers, first of all, as I said earlier, the Cloud platform is now already used and trusted by over four million applications. And a lot of it is about making sure we are very seriously committed to the space, which we are.
And in terms of wanting, there's a breadth of feature requirements, and so we've been carefully taking customer feedback and addressing all those needs. And as time goes by, I think we are getting very competitive. We have natural advantages in doing this, but we also need to make sure we address all the feature needs, and that's what we've been focused on. And I think we are at a point now where the product is ready to be used at scale. And so I expect to get significant traction in 2016.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Sundar, could you talk a little bit about – provide any milestones for autonomous vehicles and Nest? They're two of the Other Bets that we're particularly intrigued by here. I know they're very long-term bets, but the milestones that you've seen that kind of give you confidence in the forward direction of those businesses? Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
So I'll take that. Those are two of the businesses that are, as we call them, Other Bets. Look, on the self-driving cars, we have an extraordinary tech team. We've been working on it for many years, and the focus is developing technology with a real emphasis on safety and understanding what it takes to build and operate fully autonomous vehicles.
We continue to make great progress. We've now driven 1.3 million miles with important data regarding the safety and utility, and that's what we're really focused on. We've got prototypes on streets in two cities. So we're continuing to execute against that and continuing to build it out.
And then, on Nest, we have now more than 14,000 developers who've joined the Works with Nest program, enabling them to connect with Nest products through the Cloud. The team refreshed the entire product portfolio in 2015. That resulted in very strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, and again, similarly, they're just executing against that business plan.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Ruth, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail on the U.S. acceleration. It's been pretty strong four quarters in a row. Is that YouTube and Search? Any more detail on that would really be helpful if those individual businesses have accelerated. And then, on the Other Bets business, clearly, and you mentioned milestones a couple of times, the losses have really increased over the last two quarters. Could you share any of those milestones with us? Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Sure. So starting with the U.S., I think the main point is that we've had meaningful growth in all geographies, reflecting the product strength and the added tailwind of the holiday season. And looking forward, we would expect typical seasonal patterns to hold Q4. As you know well, it tends to be our strongest quarter. But specifically on the U.S., that as we talked about last quarter, really reflects the diversity of our products here. Each is doing well. Mobile growth, as both Sundar and I talked about, was the key driver yet again. But YouTube and programmatic continue to deliver strong growth, and that translates into the results that you saw for the U.S. We obviously had a nice lift from retail, no surprise given the holiday season. But I think simply put, it's the diversity of doing a lot across a lot of different products.
And then in terms of the milestones and your question regarding Other Bets, as I mentioned in the opening comments, results this quarter were affected by project milestones. Those milestones were established several years ago. And that's why I called out that it could be lumpy on a quarterly basis and why we look at it over a year, over rolling 12 months, and I'm not going to break it out in more detail than that. As Larry said, when we announced Alphabet, it's an exciting new chapter. It is about getting more ambitious things done. We're doing that in a framework to ensure we are disciplined with our resources, and this was just calling out a milestone established some time ago.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay, thank you. Sundar, you just called out Gmail as the latest among your products to reach 1 billion users. So I guess at this point, you're explicitly monetizing Search, YouTube, and Gmail to some degree, while some of the other products maybe they're a bit more nascent are still not monetized or under-monetized, it seems. So big picture as you look at the next 1 billion users who want to come online and use your products, are you in any hurry to begin monetization at all?
And, Ruth, I think since you came on board, CapEx is down basically every quarter. Granted, fourth quarter of 2014 had the discretionary real estate purchase in there, but in your budgeting process for 2016, is the nature of what you're going to be spending money on changing much at all for core Google? And in regards to the CapEx for the Other Bets, being primarily for Fiber, it seems like there are six upcoming cities and 11 potential cities. What is the green-lighting process for whether a city gets considered or not? Okay, thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
Great. I take a very long-term view towards this. When we look at the scale of mobile for the first time in our lifetime, so I think we have a platform which is going to reach one day the entirety of the world's population, so it will be over 5 billion users. And from our standpoint, core to our mission, we want to be in a position where we are helping users throughout the day. We are assisting users with their core information needs across all our products. And I think if we do that well, a lot of that information is commercial, and hence our monetization works effectively as well, as you've seen this year. And so very focused on long-term building that user experience to be assisting users, and that's the framework with which we think about it.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And then in terms of CapEx, you've noted the important difference on a year-over-year basis a couple of sizable real estate items as part of our facilities expansion that we called out last year on top of continued investment in our technical infrastructure. But really to the heart of your question, looking ahead for 2016, we do expect to see accelerated investment in CapEx, and that's to support both Google and Other Bets. As we often talk about, we view our technical infrastructure as a key strategic asset for the company. We have terrific scale and efficiency, and the team has done an extraordinary job innovating to achieve efficiencies following a period of heavier investment in 2014.
So we're now delivering about three times the compute power for the same amount of power or dollars we did five years ago. And that's an important point because it explains some of the slower CapEx in 2015. But given our commitment to have the most potent infrastructure, we do expect to increase CapEx in 2016. And for Google, that is intended to continue to support growth in our consumer products and services globally as well as all that we're doing for our enterprise clients, as Sundar has already talked about, so CapEx in both areas there.
And then, in terms of Fiber and what we're doing more broadly in Other Bets, Fiber will continue to be, we expect, the biggest consumer. And again, you identified the driver of it. It obviously increases as we execute in a growing number of cities. One of the main things that also affected 2015 is the rollout was really measured as we worked to enhance the construction process and efficiency, doing things like developing relationships with cities and establishing protocol with construction partners, but we have more cities announced. And obviously, as we execute on those, that takes more CapEx as well.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions, two things. First, Sundar, if you could, talk a little bit about YouTube. It's been several quarters now where you've talked about the mix shift toward TrueView ads bringing down the average CPC for Sites. But can you talk about the trend that you're seeing there more on a like-for-like basis, and whether in theory that should tighten up more relative to search ads going forward?
And then, secondly, Ruth, on the core Google business, we've seen roughly 300 basis points of margin expansion here over the last year or so. I know you're talking obviously about the investments around cloud and machine learning. Do you think there is still potential there for profitability to improve in that segment? Thanks.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Let me start first on YouTube monetization. There's really no change from my comment last quarter. YouTube had very healthy revenue growth, again, driven by growth in TrueView and other video ads, but the monetization story is still evolving. It's still early innings, and we're focused on the opportunity to get larger offline budgets moved to YouTube. Given the level of user engagement globally and the compelling nature of demographics, it does remain a very attractive platform. In the near term, given the growth in viewership, YouTube TrueView CPC pricing is expected to continue to affect our overall Sites monetization mix.
And then in terms of Google and margin outlook I think is really what you're getting at, I'll go back to my prior comment. What we achieved here by pulling out the two pieces is providing, obviously, greater visibility into what we're investing within the Other Bets, but want to underscore that we continue to invest in Google. We're in early innings in many areas. And I already referenced back to the framework we use, which is to continue to push the frontier within Google as well to adjacent areas. You named one, we've talked about it on this call, it's very important, Cloud and Apps, and all that we're looking to invest there.
But we're doing more than that. It's also the moon shot areas, it's virtual reality and other areas, and these are exciting early-stage efforts. We do expect we'll be in a position to discuss in greater detail over time. I'll let you estimate the short-term impact, but we believe the investment is really important as we're enhancing the long-term potential for Google and continuing to really enrich the ecosystem.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just to go back to the YouTube comments you made and the progress in the living rooms and the progress of the YouTube Red, can you just talk a little bit about how you think about potentially going into more original scripted longer form content, or even licensed longer form content to go after even a larger share of offline ad budgets?
And then, secondly, the rest of world, can you just talk about what you're seeing in the emerging market CPCs on a constant currency basis? How big is that gap now between the emerging markets in the U.S. and how do you think about closing that longer term? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
On YouTube, let me answer first on YouTube. On YouTube, obviously, the overall momentum has been great. We have over a billion users watching hundreds of millions of hours. To me interestingly – sorry. Let me answer the YouTube question first. On YouTube, we have great momentum. We have over a billion users watching hundreds of millions of hours. And in fact, 80% of YouTube's views are from outside of the U.S. It's been an incredible year where I feel the team is on fire, focusing on launching YouTube Red, YouTube Music. And as you saw at Sundance, a big push on YouTube Originals with a focus from our top creators to create exclusive content for YouTube Red users. And so I'm really excited about all the new investments we are doing there, and users are responding very positively. And so I think it's going to be an exciting 2016 for YouTube.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
And then, in the rest of worlds, it's already growing at a high rate off a large base. And we're really pleased with the ongoing progress there. In addition to mobile, we benefited from Play and our Universal App Campaigns, as Sundar said. We're continuing to invest meaningfully in rest of world. We view it as a very sizable opportunity, bringing the next four billion online and all the opportunities there. So that's really the main focus for us at this point, is continuing to build out availability, access, and products for the rest of world.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Just two questions. One, just going back to CPCs real quickly, if we were to normalize out both TrueView and currency, I'm just wondering, any comments on how core search is doing and just how core mobile search is doing from a pricing standpoint.
And then second, just on the CapEx side, I'm just curious how you think about utilization across all of your products? And you obviously spent a lot in the past, are we at a good spot? Do we need to spend ahead? Or is there a lot of capacity that isn't being utilized right now? Thank you.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
So in terms of CPCs, other than YouTube, I guess, the other comments to add are in the fourth quarter, we did see an impact from the ad format changes that we talked about in the third quarter. That also increased our overall click base. And we believe this click growth is a positive indicator of ads that are proving to be more relevant to users. In other words, the CPC trend reflects the fact that the denominator's growing faster than the numerator. But we do view that as a long-term upside opportunity for both CPCs and revenue. So mobile continues to be very healthy as evidenced as I tried to indicate in my opening comments and Sundar did as well. And similarly, Desktop growth remains very healthy.
In terms of CapEx, I guess, the main point is we do expect it will be increasing in 2016. I've already address that. I think part of it's you got in the way you asked the question, which is we've achieved efficiencies after this heavy spend in 2014. And that's where the team was very focused, is we ramped up spend, and then we've been focused on how to extract the most efficiency here. And that, as I said, does explain some of the slower CapEx in 2015, and the reason we've been very focused on indicating that it will be increasing to support all that we're doing. It's quite a bit of requirements on both the Google side and what we're doing in Other Bets, and Fiber specifically. So part of it was the 2014 spend and the digestion in 2015.
Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great, thank you very much.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. I just have two questions for Sundar. Most of them have been answered already. But on the UK, Sundar, it's now growing over 20% despite a tougher comp. And that's the most mature digital advertising economy globally. And we haven't been over 20% at Google for three-plus years. So is this mostly a function of mobile search hitting its strides?
Is there anything else that's driving that growth up? And what do you think that says about the maturity or lack thereof of digital advertising globally as we look at all other regions? And then, you also made the comment during the prepared remarks that ARPU for Play, I believe you were referring to Play is up 30%. Is that on a like-for-like geo basis? And is that a function of the personalization efforts that Google has been doing within Play? Or is that more a function of just the overall content flowing through Play evolving and maturing? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.
On the first half, when I think about growth, you're right. And as Ruth mentioned earlier, too, mobile search, YouTube, they're all working well. But I would take into account overall a secular shift to mobile, how users are adopting mobile. And on top of that, I think we're working hard to serve our users well on mobile. So it's a combination of all of that, and I think the model is working well.
On Play, to be very clear, spend per buyer is up 30%, and that's globally. And it's a function of, as you pointed out, I think we've made good strides in terms of personalizing the experience for each user. And I think that's borne fruit. But a lot of it is also improving our ability to handle payments for users and developers, and to do that better through time at a global scale.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thank you. I think they're both for Ruth. I just wanted to make sure I was interpreting your comments correctly earlier. You talked about looking at the trendline on a trailing 12-month basis with the Other Bets losses to give a sense of the trendline. I think operating losses roughly doubled on a year-on-year basis on a trailing basis. Is that sort of the trajectory that you're wanting us to think about going forward?
And then, more of a housekeeping question around Other Bets, can you just describe what you mean by project milestones and maybe provide an example of that? And then, on the Search business, can you talk about what sort of progress that you've seen in the auction in terms of closing the gap between the average mobile CPC and desktop? Thanks.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.
So the trend, when I talked about looking at an annual or rolling 12-month to assess trends, it was really to say that there can be idiosyncrasies on a quarterly basis that – so it leads to a lumpiness, just again, given how early-stage these are, and any particular events in one or more companies can affect the overall numbers. It was not intended to, say, take the 2014 over 2015 and extrapolate, far from it. The budgeting process that we went through was a very rigorous process. As I said my opening comments, we prioritized some, we made some tough calls, but very much with a view of having a very disciplined envelope around the way we are looking at the opportunities we have across the Other Bets. And so we look them again opportunity by opportunity.
In terms of the milestones, they can really vary for a number of things, but it would be linked to anything at the company, which, in our view, whether it's technically or from a business perspective, advances the development of the company, the value of the company, and we're not going to go into detail on each one of the specific companies. I think your second question was around Search in terms of the monetization trends in Search, and I think I've already addressed that one as well.
When I first provided color on desktop and mobile, the point is really about the health of both of them, and as I've already said here on this call, mobile continues to outperform, desktop growth remains healthy. And with all the comments that both Sundar and I made with respect to mobile, it should be clear that mobile search revenue was up significantly this quarter.

Ruth Porat
Thanks, Ellen. We turned in a strong performance in the third quarter, notwithstanding continued meaningful currency headwinds. The key highlight this quarter was the substantial growth of our mobile search revenue complemented by ongoing strong contributions from YouTube and our programmatic business. I will first give you a summary of the quarter, followed by specific financial details and conclude with comments regarding our upcoming move to segment reporting. Sundar will then review the business and product highlights of the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Beginning with the summary of our financial performance, total revenue was $18.7 billion up 13% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.6 billion or $1.3 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 21% year-over-year and 7% sequentially.
On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.7 billion and the operating margin was 25%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating profit was $6.1 billion and the operating margin was 33%. GAAP operating income was up 26% versus last year and GAAP net income from continuing operations was up 36% year-over-year.
As a reminder, the year-on-year increases reflect a non-cash impairment charge of $378 million in the third quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP operating income was up 15% year-over-year and non-GAAP net income was up 19% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $5.73; non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $7.35.
As detailed in the earnings slides on our IR website, stock-based compensation totaled $1.4 billion, up 14% year-over-year and up 27% sequentially. With respect to stock-based compensation, the increase reflects the fact that our annual equity refresh grants were made in the third quarter as well as headcount growth.
Headcount increased 16% versus last year and 5% versus 2Q 2015. Sequential growth reflects typical seasonality with new grad starting, the vast majority of whom are engineers and product managers. Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements, starting with our primary revenue sources.
Google sites revenue was $13.1 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth reflect substantial strength in mobile search due to ongoing improvement in ad formats and delivery to better address how consumers use their mobile devices.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a significant rate with growth driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 4% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, continuing to reflect the significant growth of Programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue was $1.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially.
Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on other revenue. Year-over-year growth was driven by Google for Work, including cloud, as well as continued strong growth in Play. Both were offset by the absence of revenues included in 3Q 2014 from a licensing agreement and lower hardware sales, as we reached the end of life cycles for certain Chromecast and Nexus devices.
Next, let me discuss revenues by geography, which will highlight the impact currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business. U.S. revenue was up 19% year-over-year to $8.8 billion and up 9% versus Q2. UK revenue was up 10% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, and up 7% sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 18% year-over-year, and 7% quarter-over-quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 7% versus last year to $8.1 billion and up 2% versus Q2. In fixed FX terms revenues were up 23% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The acceleration in U.S. and UK growth in particular reflect the growth in mobile search.
Finally, on monetization, as a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 23% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. In terms of the drivers, within Google Sites paid clicks were up 35% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Google site CPCs were down 16% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially.
The movement in Google Sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube TrueView. Network paid clicks were down 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially reflecting the impact of our ongoing policy changes designed to reduce lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search, consistent with our focus on improving the user experience. Network CPCs were down 4% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially.
Let me now turn to expenses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $3.6 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, essentially flat as a percentage of revenue sequentially and down slightly year-over-year. As a reminder, the Sites’ tagline includes the tag that we paid the search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.2 billion in Q3, up 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, as well as content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and Play.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.7 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year-over-year and up 7% versus Q2. The increase in operating expense versus comparable periods was primarily driven by R&D expense. A breakout of individual operating expense lines is available on our earnings slides. Other income and expense was $183 million. The effective tax rate was 19% for the third quarter.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities. Operating cash flow was $6 billion with free cash flow of $3.6 billion.
Finally turning to cash, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $73 billion, of which approximately $42 billion or 58% is held overseas. As we announced today, our board has authorized us to commence a repurchase of our Class C capital stock of up to $5,099,019,513.59. This decision is consistent with our overall capital management framework and complements a disciplined capital allocation program. Our primary uses of capital will of course remain CapEx and M&A across the breadth of our businesses.
So now let me conclude, starting in the fourth quarter with our move to segment reporting, we intent to provide additional detail for Google on the one hand, and all the other Alphabet businesses on the other hand. We refer to those other Alphabet businesses as Other Bets. We expect Other Bets to include among others Access and Energy, Nest, Life Sciences, our investment arms and X, which is where driverless cars and certain other incubation efforts reside.
Specifically, we intend to disclose for both Google and Other Bets revenues profitability and CapEx. By doing this we expect that you will be better able to understand how we manage the businesses, including the pace and allocation of our investments. As Larry said in his CEO letter announcing Alphabet, we are focused on rigorously managing capital allocation and working denature each business is executing well.
With that preface, let me turn to for key themes. First, in terms of revenues are strong revenue growth in Q3 reflects the ongoing momentum in Google with acceleration in mobile search complemented by the strength of YouTube and programmatic. The Other Bets our earlier stage businesses, which we believe have significant longer-term revenue potential. In the near-term, the focus there is on optimizing our investments. Second, with respect to profitability, we remain focused on managing expenses within our control, while investing to support the growth areas we have in Google and Other Bets. Segment reporting by definition provides greater insight into the profit dynamics within alphabet.
Third as to CapEx, the vast majority to date, of course has been to support Google, where we continue to invest given our exciting opportunities globally. At the same time CapEx and Other Bets is expected to increase through next year as we continue to execute on the growth agenda there. In particular in Access and Energy, which contains our fiber business, among other efforts. Fourth, our growing cash balance remains a powerful tool giving us the flexibility to invest in the breadth of opportunities we have within Google and Other Bets as well as to selectively pursue compelling new bets.
I will now turn the call over to Sundar, will go into more detail regarding our business trends and products.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Ruth. I’m glad to be here with you all today to talk about the areas we are focused on now and in the future at Google. There is a real sense of energy and focus throughout the company and we’re seeing momentum across our businesses. Products like Search, Android, Maps, Chrome and YouTube each have over a billion users already, and Google Play crossed that milestone this quarter as well. But what’s most exciting is that we are just beginning to scratch the surface.
We know that computing transforms people’s lives, we’ve gone from the PC revolution to the Internet revolution to the mobile revolution. And 10 years from now, everything will be different again in ways no one can predict. Our vision is for Google to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses a unique technical expertise to tackle big problems and create that future. We do this, arm-in-arm with our partners around the world.
Today, I want to touch on three key areas that are important for us; first, making information accessible and useful; then how we are building computing platforms used by billions of people; and lastly, how we are driving growth in our core advertising business as well as new emerging businesses.
Let’s start with the first area. Google’s core mission has always been to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Search continues to be at the center of this with people turning to search on mobile every day to find quick answers, in fact search traffic on mobile phones have now surpassed desktop traffic worldwide.
We are also seeing strong mobile momentum in many emerging markets like India, which is a number two country for mobile search queries behind the U.S. This is the result of a laser focus on helping users quickly find the right information. People just want to be able to find the information they are looking for on mobile without having to worry about whether it lives on the mobile web or within apps. Mobile app usage as well as web usage is accelerating significantly.
We have now indexed more than hundred billion deep links within third-party apps. So if you’re looking for information that lives within an app will surface it as a result, and even give you an install link if you don’t already have it. The teams have made great progress and 40% of search is now returned app index results in the top five results. These investments have gone well and you’ll continue to see us push in this area.
We also continue to improve the Google app, for instance app developers can now build conversational voice experiences that work within the Google app, so if you ask Google to play NPR, NPR will respond by asking if you want to pick up where you left off, or catch up on the latest news. It’s also very important that we help to make the mobile web better and faster for users, both through our own products and by partnering with others. Working with over 30 publication and technology partners we recently announced an open source initiative called Accelerated Mobile Pages to make it easy for publishers and content creators to build superfast webpages for their content. This will help make the mobile web a better more enjoyable experience for users.
I also want to point out that our investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence are a priority for us. Machine learning has long powered things like voice search, translation, and much more. And our machine learning is hard at work in mobile services like Now on Tap, which quickly assist you by providing additional useful information for whatever you’re doing, right in the moment, anywhere on your phone. If you’re an Android user that runs Marshmallow, try it out by long pressing the home button, when you’re in the Map, it’s very cool.
Another example is the Google photos app, which leverages powerful machine learning technology to help people discover, organize and share their photos. It’s a great product that people love. In fact, in just a few months since we launched it at Google I/O, photos is now used by over a 100 million users who have collectively uploaded more than 50 billion photos and videos.
Now I want to talk about how we’re building computing platforms that are used by billions of people. We’ll continue to invest in large open ecosystems that we’ve build with partners to reach great scale. Android is a prime example of this, and we’re seeing exciting momentum on our platform. There are more than 1.4 billion 30-day active Android users around the world, and we are beginning to roll out Android Marshmallow which is our best-performing release yet.
Working with partners Huawei and LG, we announce the newest devices joining our Nexus family. The Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. They are beautiful and powerful devices that show off the latest and greatest that the android has to offer and they’ve got tremendous reviews so far. We also announced the Pixel C which is the first android tablet built N2N by Google that brings together the benefits of a full-size keyboard with the portability of tablet. We’re also creating platforms for newer areas of computing such as android wear, which now works with iOS as well.
Android Auto, the Internet of Things platform that we unveiled at I/O Brillo, and of course Chrome. Chrome also powers Chromecast, and our recent Chromecast update gave it a refreshed look and faster performance. We also introduced Chromecast audio, which lets you stream your favorite music from your phone to any set of speakers. To date we have sold over 20 million Chromecast devices and have seen over 1.5 billion taps of the cast button since we launched.
We’re also seeing great momentum in our ads business. Our value proposition to market is of all sizes is simple, Google can help you show the right ads to the right people, at the right moment. As you’ve heard on these calls before, we are seeing a major shift in consumer behavior to its micro-moments. These are moments of high intent when consumers are looking to find, buy or do something. They happen throughout the day most often on mobile devices. The single biggest theme throughout our advertising business is to help small businesses, large marketers, agencies and content creators to take advantage of this mobile opportunity.
In search advertising is a huge amount going on. Advertisers like Dunkin’ Donuts and Airbnb are turning to mobile search to capitalize on these key moments reach customers, and create engaging local experiences. We also recently made search ads in Google Play available to all developers letting app developers find new customers for their app at a great price where it matters.
Many smart developers are already taking advantage of this. At Adweek, we introduced Customer Match, which lets marketers reach their existing customers with customized search ads on Google.com, as well as ads in YouTube and Gmail. Of course, these are really valuable for reaching key customers at moments of high intent on mobile devices.
With the holiday season coming up, we are investing in providing great shopping experiences on mobile. We are also helping marketers understand how Search ads are driving in-store sales with products like Store Visits which uses our unique mobile location capabilities and is easy for any business to implement.
Moving to YouTube, everyday people watch hundreds-of-millions of hours on YouTube. You know from the last quarterly call about the amazing momentum that YouTube has in mobile. It’s largely coming from the YouTube app. The growth in mobile watch time also extends to videos featuring product reviews and information. People turn to YouTube and they want to research, buy or fix a product. For example, mobile watch time for apparel videos has doubled this year and videos about toys have also doubled.
We see the same growth in advertising on the platform too. And we continue to invest in building ways for marketers to reach consumers effectively, like our recently announced shopping ads for YouTube, which lets people shop directly from a video, turning any relevant video into your digital storefront. And in programmatic video and display, the strong momentum continues. The number of advertisers using our programmatic solutions has nearly doubled in the last year-and-a-half, and now includes over 80% of adages top hundred advertisers.
Additionally, both mobile and video impressions served on DoubleClick Bid Manager have grown more than 3.5X since last year. This is an area that’s on fire for us right now and you’ll see us to continue to invest in creating the best programmatic solutions for advertisers and agencies. Before I close, I want to touch on a few of our emerging businesses where we see enormous opportunities.
First, digital content, Google Play continues to be a thriving hub for our digital content business, now with over 1 billion users. And just yesterday, I was really pleased that we announced YouTube Red, our YouTube subscription service for just $9.99 a month. It enables you to see videos on YouTube without ads, watch them offline, or keep playing videos when you lock your screen or start using another application.
Additionally, our Google for Work business is seeing tremendous growth. In the third quarter, we crossed 1 million paying active customers using Google Drive at Work. Cloud is also a growing area where we see great opportunity and we are building a fantastic service that we’ll keep investing in. Our momentum in the education space continues as well with more than 50 million Google apps for education users worldwide, and over 10 million teachers and students using Google Classroom since it launched a year ago. There are also 30,000 new Chromebooks activated in schools in the U.S. every school day. That’s more than all other devices combined.
So to wrap up, we have tremendous new opportunities in our new and existing businesses. We are really excited by the products and platforms that we are building for people everywhere in the world. And we are passionate about the transformative power of computing to improve people’s lives in the years ahead.
Thank you to everyone for your keen interest in our business. And thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for another great quarter. And with that, I will hand it back to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Mark Mahaney
Great. Thanks. Two questions, could you talk about the sustainability of the mobile search revenue growth that you see there? And is that just really been driven by finally the gapping up of kind of mobile search pricing versus desktop pricing or is there something else going on?
And then, Ruth, I was just trying to figure out how you came up with that - your repurchase number and I’ve been Googling that number a couple of times. I can see it’s 26 to the E18 of the square root of that, but outside of that, how did you come up with that particular amount of share buyback? Why not more and why not less? Thanks.
Ruth Porat
Thanks, Mark. So starting on the sustainability of mobile revenue growth, as I said, in my opening comments, revenue growth really reflects continued improvement in ad formats and delivery. And that’s on top of what’s a really strong industry-wide global growth in mobile usage as you know well. And then we regularly adjust the way we present ads. So we expanded ad space in some queries with particularly high commercial intent to display more relevant mobile friendly ads.
And our view is just as we saw consumer behavior change on desktop we are seeing the same on mobile. And as Sundar said, we continue to believe we’re in very early innings here. And then in terms of sizing, so this is the way we approached it. If I take you back to the capital framework that I laid out last quarter, it’s defined primarily by CapEx and M&A, but also includes working capital and a buffer as well as a potential return of capital.
And we remain focused on solving the biggest problems and solving them at scale and that presents sizable potential revenue opportunities. It was a key catalyst for creating Alphabet. But these opportunities also require investment. And so the focus of our team is on prioritizing these opportunities over a multiyear period. We look out, kind of as we’re modeling it out a number of years. And then working with the Board we reviewed our outlook. We reviewed the opportunity set and we concluded that layering in this action at this time complements what we view as a very disciplined budgeting process, while still very importantly providing ample capacity to pursue the growth agenda.
And then, applying this framework once we had come up with the size that we believe fits and consistent with the way we do things around here, we decided to come up with some fun math similar to the way we approach sizing the IPO, which sounds like you’ve fit back right into what that was. We do view it as the right action at the right time. And it really is anchored in the framework.
Mark Mahaney
Thanks, Ruth.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ross Sandler
Thanks. I have one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, so back to the mobile search question, the bear-case on Google has been the company’s ability or lack thereof to port the search business model from PC over to mobile. And you called out mobile search is the key driver of acceleration in both the U.S. and UK. So can you just give us a little bit of more color around the volume trends that you are seeing between desktop and mobile as you cross that 50% threshold that you talked about last quarter.
And then, Sundar, on the platform side, it seems like every few years new company crop up as the next big Android OEM. Looks like it’s Huawei now. It’s been other companies in the past. How do you plan on getting Android to a point where all these OEMs can build successful businesses on the back of it? And any update on when Google plans to roll out the Play Store in China would be helpful. Thank you.
Ruth Porat
So starting with mobile and our outlook there, clearly, as I said, mobile search revenue was up significantly and it was an important catalyst in the quarter. But the very important thing to note, as we discussed also last quarter, is that desktop remains a solid contributor. And so we continue to have a healthy growth there. And when we look, if you step back, overall sites revenue, we’re firing on all cylinders, really strong growth in mobile, desktop is healthy and continuing to grow. And then you layer on top of it YouTube and some of the color that Sundar added there. But that’s really a continuation of what we talked about last quarter as well.
Sundar Pichai
And on the platform side, look, we continue to see tremendous momentum overall on Android. In just over a year, we’ve gone from 1 billion to 1.4 billion users. So obviously that translates into huge opportunities for OEMs and that’s what we are seeing. Especially, there are whole new markets opening up, there’s next billion users coming online in emerging markets. And businesses, I mean, Enterprises, a whole opportunity for OEMs as well. So I think there is a lot of room ahead.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Carlos Kirjner
Thank you. I have two questions as well, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, in two parts, if you take a three-year view what are the three main milestones you think you need to reach to be successful as Google’s CEO? And what you think would be the externally observable consequences of achieving these milestones?
And Ruth, in the last call, you talked about the 70/20/10 framework. Can you help us understand what 70/20/10 applies to? Is it related to operating expenses, or expenses in cost in the P&L, CapEx, R&D, management time? And is it an explicit constraint in the budgeting process or am I trying to read too much into something that’s just a concept of framework and a broad guideline? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Carlos. In terms of how I think about it, I think we are fortunate to have an incredibly broad mission statement. Organizing the world’s information turns out to be something that has a lot of room ahead, we are still in the early days. Especially with mobile I think you have a computing platform that’s going to reach, it’s already reached half the world’s population or on its way to reach the entirety of the human population in about five to 10 years.
So want to stay focused on that both from information standpoint and a computing standpoint, I think of them as two sides of the same coin, and making sure we are building the right user experience for that. And so that’s what I’m focused on.
Ruth Porat
And then on 70/20/10 it’s intended to be instructive and it’s intended to mirror the founders’ vision and really capture how we devote our resources, which for us means, how do we apply effort. And for me, one of the many very important statements from the founders that explains this framework is when they said in the letters some years ago and repeated since, incrementalism in technology leads to irrelevance and thus innovation is critical.
And so this mantra is really about pushing people to look at new areas, invest in newer areas, look for things that are adjacent the 20% and even the unrelated big bets, the 10%. It’s not intended to be a specific guide to financial modeling. I think with our move to segment reporting, we look forward to giving you more information next quarter which should be helpful there, but directionally to talk about philosophically how do we think about our approach to the business.
Carlos Kirjner
Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Heather Bellini
Great. Thank you very much. This question is for Ruth. I was just wondering given you’re likely in the midst of 2016 business planning right now. Can you share with us the way in which you’re approaching budgeting versus maybe how it was done last year? And are there any specifics you can share with us in terms of how you’re thinking about it? Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Well. I guess a couple of things, there has been a very strong foundation here on budgeting and the approach and setting an envelope, and working very closely with business leaders on what that that envelope should be, and we are in the midst of it in. As I said last quarter, but to emphasize our priority remains revenue growth and that doesn’t give us a pass on a rigorous approach to expense growth, and that’s where we’re focused.
So I think really what was very encouraging for me is there is a framework, a very strong approach to financial planning and analysis, and really building on that to make sure we have reasonable but tight envelope so that we can have the right conversations collectively, collaboratively with our business leaders to assess how we can look at optimizing all of our resources, and that’s what it really comes down to, it’s looking at how to manage the rate of growth of expenses, while still supporting our growth initiatives and we’ll be going into more of that in as we go through our segment reporting in the fourth quarter.
Heather Bellini
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brian Nowak
Thanks for taking my questions. One on YouTube, I guess could you talk some of the qualitative drivers that are really bring more advertising dollars on the YouTube. And then, I think last quarter you’d mentioned top 100 advertisers spend was up 60% year-on-year on YouTube. I’m wondering if you could update us on that?
And the second one, on Search, sounds like mobile is accelerating, where you now in the mobile versus desktop monetization gap. And Sundar, how do you think about that long-term, you see mobile being higher, reaching equilibrium, how do you see that trending?
Sundar Pichai
On the YouTube one, look I mean to shift to video is a profound medium shift, and especially in the context of mobile. And obviously users are following that you’re seeing it in YouTube as well as elsewhere in mobile. And so advertisers are being increasingly conscious, they’re being very, very responsive. And so we are seeing great traction there, and we’ll continue to see that, they are moving more of their traditional budgets to YouTube and that’s where we’re getting traction.
On mobile search - to me - increasingly we see - we already announced that or 50% of our searchers are on mobile. Mobile gives us very unique opportunities in terms of better understanding users and over time as we use things like machine learning, I think we can make great strides. So my long-term view on this is, it is ask compelling or in fact even better than the desktop, but it will take us time to get there, and we’re going to be focused to be get that.
Brian Nowak
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the question, maybe a big picture question with respect to media distribution, media consumption and monetizing that you should across all the platforms that you distribute media. I’m so curious about the various business models you’re now putting in front of consumers, subscription versus advertising versus paper unit like on Google Play. How you think about the about the pros and cons and some of those distribution models? And do how think about the need to may be source content yourself for media distribution? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks. To me, we want to stay focused on the user experience and we want to follow what users want, right. So if you take something like YouTube, we expect most users to consume, YouTube debate has been and advertising has been a strong part of providing the content for free to those users, and it’s growing very, very well, but we also see a need for certain users, in certain scenarios be it music or gaming or for premium content to experience it in a different way. And we want to make sure we do that. So we don’t have a prescriptive opinion on this as much as we will provide the right user experience and follow where it goes, and that applies to Google Play as well.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Justin Post
Thank you. Two things, Ruth, it really does seem like there’s been a change in the management philosophy this year as far as kind of expense discipline into 2Q, also have seen the disclosures and now you get the buyback announcement. Could you talk about the change there, if there has been one, and how you think about that?
And then the second thing, we were pretty focus on the cloud over here, Google. We don’t have a number. It’s in your other revenues, but Amazon is probably $8 billion plus run rate, Microsoft over $1.5 billion. Just wondering you can give us any thoughts on your cloud strategy and how you’re thinking about using those really strong data center assets? Thank you.
Ruth Porat
So I guess, there were a couple of things, on expenses and expense management and clearly a lot of the foundation here has - was laid some time ago. I think after a period of big expense buildup, there was an appreciation that we needed to manage the cadence of spend. And that’s what we’re doing and collectively we’re locked arm-in-arm to make sure that there’s resource prioritization. I think that’s an important part of that we have an extraordinary set of opportunities, not just within Google but across the Alphabet businesses, and we need to ensure that prioritization is a key part of all that that we do.
I would note that when you’re looking at some of the expenses, operating expenses is an example. When we look forward to the fourth quarter, in particular given the hardware launches that we’ve done here with the Nexus Chromecast and Pixel launches, a consistent with prior device launches we would expect higher sales and marketing and I realized I’m getting a little more specific than your question, but I think it’s very important to note that there are also certain patterns to some of these similarly with CapEx, CapEx is - it’s been a bit more muted here. And I indicated last quarter that where in a bit of a digestion period.
But when you look forward to 2016, we do see accelerated investment given the nature of the businesses that we’re building up here. So I want to also just keep make sure, we can things and perspective. And I think, it’s just, it’s been an extraordinary experience joining this team, I think the with the move to Alphabet it gives us the opportunity to then provide some greater insight into the extraordinary operating performance within Google and breakouts you can see the investments that we’re doing and we’re working very tightly as a senior team here as we make that next step into this new environment in Alphabet.
Sundar Pichai
On the cloud side, and he observed, I mean it’s an exceptional opportunity, I think it just reflects is a secular shift every businesses in the world is going to run on cloud, eventually and so we viewed as an amazing opportunity. We’re uniquely qualified to do so, as he pointed out we have tremendous experiences and running large scale cloud services.
And it’s been only in the past two years, and earnest we have been taking those assets and serving customers outside. For me, what’s exciting as I look at new customer adoption, we are seeing tremendous momentum. We’re very competitive in each of those situations, and we are investing a lot and playing for the long-term.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Douglas Anmuth
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Sundar, I want to ask about mobile. You talked about being greater than 50% of queries and want to ask if you have a view on whether - on when that will pass 50% of clicks. And then also your thoughts on what happens to desktop pricing in demand, as that happens how do you think about the tail on the desktop business as mobile just continues to take share? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai
The interesting thing, we’re seeing is, when we talk about mobile, mobile is a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of his desktop today as well. So overall it’s a shift in a computing paradigm, it’s not just form factors. And so overtime we see all of this is together. What matters to us as people evolve they are computing paradigm search transitions to that world, and we are the best source to provide that information.
So along that line, I expect all the metrics to follow the trend, and so we only see, all the right indicators, and so I think we are position for the long-term well, so I can’t comment too much on the specifics beyond that.
Douglas Anmuth
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Sena from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ken Sena
Thank you. I just have an ad format question, maybe just to follow-up on Eric’s. We noticed that there was an additional ad slot added on mobile. And can you just maybe talk through the decisioning on that? And if so, is there anything we should interpret as far as the other ad formats that have been used too? Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Well, big picture what we are doing is looking at ways to use the mobile screen space to be as useful as possible for users. So this quarter we had some important changes and we’re always focused on innovation, and we’re growing in a growing market. But as we’ve said we’re looking at how consumer behavior is changing and just as it did on desktop we’re seeing the same on mobile and the notion of trying to make sure were being as useful as possible for users is key driver and we’ll continue to innovate.
Ken Sena
And maybe just this one follow-up. Can you see anything then it maybe in terms of the success with the efficiency that you’re seeing in terms of text based mobile ads versus more of the other structured data ones that’s around like part of glycerin [ph] or hotel price ads and so forth? Thanks.
Ruth Porat
Yes. There is probably not much to add there.
Ken Sena
Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Anthony DiClemente
Thanks a lot. I have two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar is ad blocking something that potential have an impact on the business either in the fourth quarter or longer term? And then, Ruth, in terms of M&A just wondering if the buyback might indicate that the company is becoming a bit more selective around larger acquisitions than it’s been in prior periods of the company’s lifecycle? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Anthony. On the ad blocker stuff, it’s not a new phenomenon. I think it’s important to understand that ads today fun almost all the services which people use, including products like Google Search, Google Maps many, many third-party products. For publishers, it represents the majority of the revenue and I think users are okay with the contract and we need to make sure it works well. It’s also clear that that are areas where the ad experience is getting in the way, it affects performance, and so we as industry need to collectively do all that better. And so we are going to work hard to do that.
And then, so we want to make sure we transition areas like the mobile web to have better ad experiences. But overall, I think we’ve used to this, we’ve seen this for a while overwhelmingly the model works well and we expect that to continue.
Ruth Porat
And then, in terms of your M&A question, I talked about how did we think of sizing the return, I started with what’s really most quarter as which is continuing to focus on the biggest problems and solving them at scale, and ensuring that we’re investing in those. And as I said that’s primarily to find by obviously the opportunity, but how do we support the growth that’s about capital expenditure and about M&A, and those are really the anchor pillars in our capital framework. And then beyond that there is working capital and a buffer and then the potential return of capital. We talked about the fact that we have six products that have over billion users. Three of those were through acquisitions, YouTube, Android and Maps that is not lost on us, and then you layer on top of that, double-click that was also through acquisition.
So we do have you viewed app and at the time, it wasn’t clear, I’d say everybody that those would end up being the incredibly powerful businesses, effective businesses for users that they are today. And so it remains a part of what we consider the bar is high, but I certainly wouldn’t want you to read anything into it beyond, what it is it fits right within our framework, and as I said, we reviewed is the right action at the right time.
Anthony DiClemente
That’s it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Paul Vogel
Great. Thanks. Two questions, please. First, just when we think about search and deep liking. Can you just sort of quantify a little bit how important deep linking has been to either click, so ROI or improvements in CPC on mobile? And then, the second question is just as we think about the more transparency going forward in Q4. How should we think about businesses that currently are in the Other Bets line that may continue to growing. What would be considered to move something from other bets into core Google? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
On the deep linking, I would view it as, we’re beginning to scratch the surface in terms of how we get it information within apps. What’s been exciting to us is all of the indication show that when we provide these deep links. Users respond to them the same way they’ve done with links to websites and the model is working well. And second think maybe…
Ruth Porat
Yes. Interesting in the way frame the question, so within other bets we have a pretty broad array of challenges, opportunities that are being tackled, as you know well from life sciences to driverless cars to what we’re doing in access and energy. And those we’re funding, we’ve got a very rigorous disciplined approach to looking at the metrics against which they’re performing and growing. But you used a term, when do they move into Google. And I wouldn’t assume that, that’s the plan. What we’re really looking at is how do we continue to broaden the nature of issues that we’re able to address.
What we want with Alphabet is to be an extraordinary magnet, the best magnet for entrepreneurs, and to be an accelerant for their development. And to give them that the kind of environment where we can continue to thrive, and therefore build great businesses that generate tremendous returns as well for our stakeholders on top of solving big problems. But that doesn’t necessarily mean, in fact, we’re very much thinking they will continue to grow and be independent entity. So it is a broader view of what is Alphabet.
Paul Vogel
Got it. So just to be clear, it’s not about that there are sort of newer or smaller or growing. It’s just they’re separate business that will grow on their own, separate from the core Google.
Ruth Porat
Our view is that we are seeding them and they are growing. And we’re not pre-determining what ends up happening. There are big opportunities and we’re excited to be in a position where we can address them in a way that is an incredible magnet for great entrepreneurs.
Paul Vogel
Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Stephen Ju
Okay. Thanks. Sundar, so I think it was on a conference call about three years ago when Larry articulated a vision of a simple and consistent consumer experience from Google, and the same for your advertising customers as well. So as this is your first conference call with investors where do you think you are in that initiative today? Are you still on the same path or do you plan to take that on a different direction in your new role?
And Ruth, despite the high growth of YouTube and Play presumably, are your cost of goods sold where the content cost of these two businesses live is not growing as rapidly. So will you give some color on where you might be driving the opage [ph]? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai
On the first one, I think the vision that Larry articulated, it’s a very compelling vision and it’s still valid. To me, the way I think about it is mobile is a good forcing function in some ways. It’s a good constraint for us to focus and deliver against that vision. So what I’m doing is internally all our objectives are primarily focused on mobile, and how within the context of mobile we get to a better, simpler and a consistent experience for consumers and advertisers. And so, that framework is how we are thinking about it and I think we are making solid progress.
Ruth Porat
And then, if you’re focusing on the other cost to revenue line, the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth was driven by ongoing data center operations, including depreciation that’s in there as well, as well as content acquisition costs, as you said primarily YouTube and Play. One thing to note as we look forward to the fourth quarter with the launch of Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel, it’s worth noting that we do book the hardware costs in this line.
Stephen Ju
Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Mark May
Thanks. I had two questions that are kind of interrelated around mobile apps. When you talk about the strength in mobile search are you including also searches that are done on some of your mobile apps like search done on the Maps app or on the mobile YouTube app? And then, kind of somewhat related I guess is, yes, I think it is six apps that have over 1 billion users globally. But some of these you’re not really monetizing today or very nascent stages. Can you talk about kind of your efforts maybe to monetize some of these large and actively used apps and maybe identify one or two where you’re, I guess, it’s for Sundar, where you’re particularly sort of excited about the opportunities? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai
Thanks, Mark. On the first one, or maybe you’re specifically talking about the mobile search experience on Google.com or the Google app, but we are seeing the same traction within Maps or YouTube. We are seeing mobile usage dramatically grow and in that context people are searching as well. So it’s across-the-board we are seeing strength. In terms of our app such of scale, and obviously we take a very long-term view. And several of those apps today already play huge roles, so for example, take Google Maps, it already plays a huge important role in making mobile search better. And so these are interrelated.
YouTube is obviously a big opportunity. Google Play is one. And even things like Gmail are playing a critical role in Google for Work and how we are driving big business opportunities as well. And, by the way, because we are scaling all these apps over 1 billion users, we are building the infrastructure which is what will power our cloud platform externally as well. So in many ways these are all working for us.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian form Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Colin Sebastian
Great. Thanks. I want to ask about two areas of business mentioned on the call. One is machine learning. And it’s just coming up a lot more frequently as a topic and I wonder if you could mention more specifically the vision that you have for some of the core applications and how machine learning can make them more useful.
And then, just as a follow to the question on the Google Cloud, and specifically, the Infrastructure-as-a-Service layer, I wonder there if your strategy is more focused on price or if there are other ways that you can differentiate the service from the competition? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai
Machine learning is core transformative way by which we are rethinking everything we are doing. We’ve been investing in this area for a while. We believe we are state-of-the-art here. And the progress particularly in the last two years has been pretty dramatic. And so we are - we are thoughtfully applying it across all our products, be it search, be it ads, be it YouTube and Play et cetera. And we are in early days, but you will see us in a systematic manner, think about how we can apply machine learning to all these areas.
On Cloud, I think the right way to think about it over time, for a company or for a developer to build stuff on cloud, they need not just basic things like computer and storage, they need a whole set of services on top of it. We - so there is a lot in the stack. And so I think the way we will differentiate over time is because we have built large services on top of our infrastructure, we understand all the layers which you need to build great application. So you would see us increasingly provide value-added services on top of compute and storage. And that’s the way I think we’ll play this.
Operator
Thank you. And that’s all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Ellen West for any closing remarks.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Google Inc Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference Ellen West, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma’am.
Ellen West
Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Google’s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Omid Kordestani. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.
Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovations, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.google.com.
I’ll now turn the call over to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thanks. We had strong performance in the second quarter, notwithstanding the continuation of substantial currency headwinds. Key highlights this quarter include ongoing momentum in our core search business particularly mobile, complemented by significant growth in YouTube revenues.
In addition, we are increasingly benefiting from the shift towards programmatic advertising, particularly among brand advertisers. These strong top-line results were complemented by ongoing operating expense discipline in the quarter as reflected in 31% year-over-year growth in GAAP operating income and 16% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating income. I will first go over a summary of the quarter followed by specific financial details and conclude with things for the near-term. Omid will then cover the business and products highlights of the quarter after which we will take your questions.
Beginning with the summary of our financial performance, total revenue was $17.7 billion, up an 11% year-over-year, and up 3% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.6 billion, or $1.1 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.8 billion and the operating margin was 27%. On a non-GAAP basis, that is excluding stock-based compensation, operating profit was $6 billion and the operating margin was 34%. GAAP net income was $3.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year, and up 12% versus Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $4.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and up 8% versus Q1.
GAAP earnings per diluted share for Class A and B shares were $4.93, and for Class C were $6.43. Higher EPS for Class C reflects the impact of the adjustment payment made in Q2. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.99. As detailed in the earnings slides on our IR website, stock-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially.
Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements. Starting with our primary revenue sources, Google sites revenue was $12.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year, and up 4% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth reflect continued strength in search, particularly mobile search. We continue to close the gap between mobile and desktop search monetization.
Specifically on mobile, we’re pleased with our ongoing progress resulting from our focus on user experience, ads quality and online to offline commerce initiatives. The combination of these efforts improves the effectiveness and value of mobile for users and marketers alike. Desktop search delivered solid revenue growth again this quarter. YouTube again delivered substantial growth in user engagement globally, particularly on mobile, which translated into strong adoption of our TrueView ad format.
Growth in watch time on YouTube has accelerated and is now up over 60% year-over-year, the fastest growth rate we’ve seen in two years. Mobile watch time has more than doubled from a year ago. Network revenue was $3.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the diversion performance of programatic on the one hand and our legacy network businesses on the other.
Our programatic business including AdExchange and DoubleClick Bid Manager continue to deliver strong year-over-year and sequential performance then more than offset lower results in AdSense for Search. We remain committed to policy changes that improve the user experience notwithstanding the fact that these policies have a negative impact on AdSense for Search revenue. Other revenue was $1.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on other revenue. Year-over-year and sequential movements were driven by substantial growth in Play offset by decline in the hardware sales.
Next revenues by geography. U.S. revenue was up 16% year-over-year to $8 billion and up 4% versus Q1. UK revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and flat sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 11% year-over-year and was flat quarter-over-quarter, rest of world revenue was up 8% versus last year to $8 billion and up 2% versus Q1. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 22% year-over-year, and up 4% sequentially highlighting both the strength of our global business as well as the impact of FX.
Finally revenue monetization; as a reminder, these metrics similarly reflect currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 18% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 11% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. In terms of the drivers within Google sites paid clicks were up 30% year-over-year, and up 10% sequentially in particular reflecting growth in YouTube TrueView as well as in mobile.
Google sites CPCs were down 16% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. Mobile CPCs continue to strengthen and the gap to desktop continues to grow as I previously noted. The decline in CPCs reflects the impact of YouTube TrueView, which is a growing percentage of overall sites clicks mix and where CPCs remain lower than on our other platforms.
Network paid clicks were down 9% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially reflecting the impact of our ongoing policy changes designed to reduce the lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search consistent with our focus on improving user experience. Network CPCs were down 3% both year-over-year and sequentially.
Let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.4 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, which was down slightly sequentially. Trends within sites and network TAC remains flat, due to mix shifts in partners, products and devices. As a reminder, the sites TAC line includes the TAC that we pay to search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3 billion in Q2, up 12% year-over-year, and up 7% versus Q1. Year-on-year and sequential growth were driven by costs associated with operating our data centers including deprecation as well as content acquisition cost primarily for YouTube and Play. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.4 billion, or 30% of revenue, up 11% year-over-year and down 1% versus Q1.
The increase in operating expense versus 2Q 2014 primarily reflects R&D expense attributable to increased hiring of engineers and product managers. Headcount increased 18% versus last year and 3% versus 1Q 2015 with total headcount at quarter-end of approximately 57,100. The deceleration in year-over-year growth and decline in quarter-over-quarter operating expenses reflects in part discipline in expense management and in part lower legal expenses than in comparable periods; a breakout of individual operating expense lines is available on our earnings slides.
Other income and expense was $131 million with interest income offset by higher expenses from our FX hedging program. The effective tax rate was 21% for the second quarter. As noted in our press release, in Q2, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities. We revised our income tax expense for the relevant periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015 in the cumulative amount of $711 million. The income tax adjustments were not material to the effected periods; more detail is available on our earnings slides.
Turning now to CapEx and cash. CapEx for the quarter was $2.5 billion, primarily for production equipment and data center construction. CapEx spend was lower versus last year and last quarter reflecting a bit of a digestion period after an extended period of investments in both data centers and the requisite machine deployment. We continue to view our computing infrastructure as one of our most strategic assets. Operating cash flow was $7 billion with free cash flow of $4.5 billion resulting in a cash balance of approximately $70 billion at the end of the quarter of which approximately $40 billion or 58% is held overseas.
Let me close with five topics of focus for the near-term, first on revenue growth and drivers. Our strong revenue growth in the second quarter, notwithstanding the adverse effects of the strong U.S. dollar evidences the health of our core search business most notably mobile, complemented by growth in YouTube and programmatic advertising. Our earlier stage products such as Fiber, Google Life Sciences, and Nest service longer-term sources of revenue. Regarding these areas, we are focused on tight governance to ensure that the resourcing for them is appropriate and we’ll talk more about these products in greater detail as I get settled in.
Second, the sequential deceleration in expense growth achieved in the second quarter reflects in part the benefit of expense discipline discussed in prior calls. A key focus is on the levers within our control to manage the pace of expenses while still ensuring and supporting our growth. We will do this while we continue to invest in engineering talent to keep us preeminent in innovation globally.
Third, the pace of growth in capital expenditures over the last several years has been significant. Although the vast majority of CapEx to date have been to support our core business, growing requirements for newer products underscore the increasing importance of optimization across the many opportunities ahead of us. Fourth, our cash balance grew again this quarter, which of course gives us more strategic flexibility. We remain focused on judiciously capitalizing on the strategic opportunities that we have, which are many. And the key issue is how we prioritize our capital allocation, given the breadth of opportunities.
Finally, as Larry has frequently noted, Google’s goal is to develop great new services that significantly improves the lives of as many people as possible. Solving problems for users at scale ultimately results in monetization opportunities. How we prioritize and focus on these opportunities remains paramount, both for our employees, who remain inspired by the opportunity to work on the most cutting edge developments with maximum global impact and for our shareholders. I look forward to working with you.
I will now turn the call over to Omid, who will cover the business details of the quarter.
Omid Kordestani
Thanks Ruth. It’s great to be here to talk with everyone again. Since we last spoke, Google has been very busy hosting our customers and developers from across the globe at events ranging from I/O to the DoubleClick Leadership Summit to BrandCast. We’re seeing great momentum and results across the company.
As you all saw at IO, we continue to invest in innovation across our core products. To call out just one, the new Photos app is a great example of how we’re combining the power of a machine learning, search and beautiful design, something that Google is proud to bring together in such a great package for our users. Our investments in machine learning have applications across the company and have real potential to improve our business. For instance, machine learning helps us to improve and adds visual design to maximize its performance. There’s enormous opportunity here.
I want to quickly share a few highlights of the past quarter and then spend more time talking about our progress in what continues to be our two biggest focus areas and growth drivers: mobile and video. First, our core products continue to do well and users love them. In fact, Google Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome and Google Maps, each have over one billion users. We also continue to see great partner momentum across the Android platform. The Android phone ecosystem started with one device, one carrier and one OEM, the T-Mobile G1 in 2008 and has grown now to over 400 OEMs and over 500 carriers, who make over 4,000 distinct devices. This is a testament to our great progress on both the tech and partnering fronts.
Google Play continues to grow at an impressive clip. Google Play games has added more than 180 million new users in the past six months and continues to be one of the fastest growing mobile gaming platforms in history. In addition, we’re seeing strong momentum around Google Cloud platform, with a range of great new features, new major customer announcements like HTC and JDA software and our collaboration with Broad Institute.
And on the advertising side as a trend towards programatic ad buying continues, we’re helping clients succeed in a multi-screen world with our DoubleClick platform. We recently expanded cross device measurement to all of our DoubleClick advertiser products, so marketers can measure these conversions for all of their campaigns. And to help publishers, we’ve recently announced full DoubleClick support for native ad formats.
Now I’ll spend a few minutes diving more into the big areas of opportunity for us, the shift to mobile and the continued growth of online video. I talked last quarter about the shift we see in consumer behavior as people turned to their phones throughout the day to decide what to buy or do. Google’s role has always been to meet people’s needs in the exact moment they are looking and those moments are increasingly happening on mobile devices.
More Google searches now take place on mobile devices than on computers in ten countries, including the U.S. and Japan, two of our largest markets. And we know that when people search on their mobile phones, they’re looking for immediacy and action. In fact, 30% of mobile queries are related to location and our efforts around local search are helping consumers to find relevant information fast.
We’re investing in creating great mobile experiences for people across Google products. As Sundar and his teams showed at I/O this year, there is a lot to be excited about from now on Tab to Android Pay and much more. As I mentioned, one of my favorites is the new photos app, where you can keep and organize all of your memories and easily share and save what matters to you. If you’re like me and have an overwhelming number of photos on your phone, the photos app makes taking, organizing and finding pictures much more manageable and enjoyable and it’s getting better every day.
In addition, our teams have made great strides to help users find what they need within third-party apps through indexing. We now have 50 billion links within apps index and 25% of signed in Google searches on Android now return deep links, taking users right to content within an app or to a link so they can install it. We also recently started showing such links in search results on iOS, developers like [indiscernible] are really seeing a boost in traffic as a result of deep linking. We also added now cards for more than 100 apps like OpenTable and Spotify and we have extended Google Voice actions to third party developers, so we can say things like, okay Google listen to MPR.
Alongside our efforts to make mobile better for users, we’re continuing to help marketers succeed in today’s mobile world. For instance at I/O we recently announced universal app campaigns, which will let developers easily reach users across Google search, the add mob network, mobile sites, YouTube and Google Play. Marketers just tell us what their ad will say, the audience they want to reach, and how much they want to spend and our ad systems will do the rest to help them maximize performance.
We introduced new mobile ad formats like automobile ads, which take you directly to a carousel of vehicle images important details like estimated MPG, and links to nearby dealer listings. And just yesterday, we announced purchases on Google, which makes it easier for people searching on Google to buy things right from their mobile phones.
I want to turn now to YouTube, which is showing strong momentum with users and advertisers as we reinvent the television experience for the digital age. On mobile alone, YouTube reaches more 18 to 49 year old in the U.S. than any U.S. cable network. And the number of users coming to YouTube, who start at the Youtube homepage similar to the way they might turn on their TV is up over three times year-on-year plus once users are in YouTube, they are spending more time per session watching videos, on mobile the average viewing session is now more than 40 minutes up more than 50% year-over-year.
As consumers continue to shift their content consumption from television to digital, brand dollars are flowing – I am sorry following, which we’re seeing an upfront buying through our Google preferred model. Compared to the same period after BrandCast as last year, Google preferred commitments in the U.S. were three times higher. We’re also seeing great adoption of our video ad formats like TrueView and continue to help marketers engage and connect the consumers in new ways. The number of advertisers running video ad on YouTube is up more than 40% year-over-year and for our top 100 advertisers, the average spend per advertiser is up over 60% year-over-year. We recently introduced a new feature for TrueView that allows brands to automatically insert product information, images and pricing into their video ads.
And as advertising increasingly shifts towards programatic buying brands can now easily buy TrueView ads programatically through DoubleClick Bid Manager. All this is helping our content creators build the next generation of media companies doing what they love making great videos. The number of channels earning six figures per year on YouTube is up 50% year-over-year.
One of the key reasons for this success is our Content ID initiative which is used by more than 8,000 partners who have claimed over 400 million videos helping them control their content on YouTube and make money on videos containing copyrighted material. So as you can see it’s been a very busy and successful quarter, we are super focus on our key goals of delivering amazing mobile and video experiences and there is lot more coming in the next few months including the Android M release, now on tap Android Pay, and YouTube gaming.
Thank you to all the Googlers around the world for their great work everyday. And now back to Ruth.
Ruth Porat
Thank you. In my comments, I meant to note that the gap between mobile and desktop continues to [Technical Difficulty]. And with that I’ll turn it back to Ellen.
Ellen West
Great, thank you [Technical Difficulty]
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Unidentified Analyst
Really had build up headcount and data center capabilities. Just where are you on capacity and really what was the purpose of this big build up, what kind of capabilities does that give Google today? Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thank you for that question. First I do want to clarify one thing in my comments on CPCs, I meant to note that the gap between mobile and desktop continues to narrow obviously an important trend wanted to clarify that. So look in terms of headcount in data center capabilities and what that does for us. As I said in our view, our infrastructure is one of the most strategic assets that we have and as we talk about what happened in the second quarter it reflects the fact that there can be some variability in the cadence of spend and so while overall capital intensity was lower in Q2 than in prior year and prior quarter, that’s a more an issue of how spend is faced during the year but the main point as we do computing capacity as a strategic asset it provides us with the flexibility necessary for growth.
And as I try to convey as well obviously it’s a priority to achieve efficiencies were possible and particular given some of the newer opportunities that we have. And so we are just beginning the 2016 budgeting process quarter that is prioritization but it really has been about strategic flexibility and the underlying strength of all that we do.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Great. Operator, we’ll go to our next question, please.
Operator
And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Duetsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ross Sandler
Great, I just had two questions. Omid, the U.S. reaccelerated looks like from 12% to 16% in the quarter, can you just give us a little color of what drove that was it more a function of core search and mobile picking up or – for YouTube? And then, Ruth did you mentioned in you prepared remarks that a lot of the expense deceleration was put in place before you got to Google. So now that you’ve been in the seat for a couple of months, can you talk about what you’re seeing and what potentially you could do in addition to what was in place in 2015 before you got there? Thank you.
Omid Kordestani
Thank you, Ross. Our performance really reflects the fact that we have a diverse set of products that are doing well. We have strength in core search obviously and in particularly mobile, YouTube and programmatic we’re seeing a lot of strength. We saw a nice pick up in a number of verticals in Q2 coming off weather-related weakness in Q1. And this quarter we’re seeing retail and travel being stronger verticals in search. As to the second part of the question, I have Ruth to address that.
Ruth Porat
And so with respect to expense management obviously a lot has been done on expense discipline has been discussed on calls for a number of quarters in. And I think it’s fair to say proper resource allocation stretches across OpEx and CapEx and it’s about prioritizing our investments and ensuring that we’re being efficient and effective with our spend. To be clear, the priority is revenue growth and we have a breadth of opportunity, but pursuing revenue growth is obviously not inconsistent with expense management.
And so as I noted we’re just starting the 2016 budgeting process, in my experience the best way to slow the rate of growth in expenses is to work closely with business leaders really anchored in data, so together we can identify ways to prioritize resources and really continue to extend the discipline that we’ve talked about. And given my early conversations with our business leaders, I look forward to this exercise over the next couple of months and we’re very engaged with it. Great, operator we’ll take our next question.
Ross Sandler
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Carlos Kirjner
Thank you. I have two questions. Ruth can you help us understand Google’s position vis-à-vis debt. It’s probably not controversial that your debt level is much below your capacity. Are there any reasons why Google would not want to raise debt, if you had to finance a large acquisition and if yes, could you help us understand what these reasons are? And secondly, how do we reconcile the strength in mobile search with the fact that distribution pack grew only 6% year-on-year? Thank you.
Ruth Porat
So starting with your question about cash which – and whether we would issue debt, I think, the way I look at that is you’re talking about overall efficiency of balance sheet and how are we using the balance sheet and I’ve slightly broadened the question more than what you did, but at the end of the day, our focus – my focus is maximizing shareholder value over the medium to long-term and that is about how effectively are we using our balance sheet where we investing and that could theoretically be a part of that. But if you step back as I’ve looked at it and the key issue is what do we need for working capital?
What do we need for CapEx? What do we need for M&A? What do we need potentially for capital return? How does one think about financing the various opportunities that we have and I would say it’s early days, it would be premature to be more specific than that. But given this profitability of our business we have many opportunities given the growing mix of our business, we have opportunities, I would say allocation decisions are mutually exclusive, allocation can obviously change as opportunities evolve. But as we look at it, we have a breadth of opportunities, again I think it’s premature to be more specific on that at this point.
Carlos Kirjner
How about the distribution TAC on growing 6% given the strength of mobile?
Ruth Porat
So as it relates to distribution TAC, sites TAC dollars are up modestly year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and that’s what I would really focus you on its the dollar change and obviously you know the 12%, but that’s a good thing, because with those TAC dollars comes revenue. As a remainder TAC includes payments made to search distribution partners is distinct from YouTube and Play content acquisition costs, which are in other cost of revenue. So looking at this on a percentage of revenue basis, what you are seeing is the impact of YouTube revenue growth, sites revenue was up. But the associated content acquisition costs are reflected in higher other cost of revenue not in sites TAC.
Carlos Kirjner
Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thank you. Operator, we’ll take our next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Stephen Ju
Okay, thanks. So, Omid big picture in the outperformance of programatic in YouTube is interesting as it seems to beg the next question as you – your current list of advertising products now seems to touch all parts of the consumer purchasing funnel. So I'm wondering where you are in uniting all of the different pieces so that you can walk into a large advertiser and lay out the data, so that the 15 second TrueView spot that they ran turn into a list in the sales of X percent. Okay, thanks.
Omid Kordestani
Sure. It’s a good question and in fact that’s one of the areas that I really focused on after I came back and, it is a suite of products that’s we are very proud of and working well for advertisers and what we like to say internally, as we like to have one Google represented to the customers so that in these conversations with them we really understand their objectives and really in the classic sense of the funnel you know we can start from the brand journey from the beginning to purchase across, search display video and then as you know we recently brought cross-device measurement to DoubleClick.
So, the focus is really on all aspect of this journey online to store we’re showing how mobile ads are driving actual store visits for advertisers and your Brand Lift studies we’re showing brands in real-time how their ads are performing, we done over 10,000 Brand Lift studies on YouTube campaigns alone. So its we really just excited about having this full suite now and being able to have the full coverage of this customer acquisition journey from branding all the way to conclusion of a transaction.
Stephen Ju
Thank you.
Omid Kordestani
Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Operator, we’ll take our next question.
Operator
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Mark Mahaney
Great, thanks. Omid, you gave a lot of great data points on the growth in YouTube and stuff that’s accelerated could you spend little bit more time on the why has YouTube seen this kind of reacceleration resurgence in growth. Do you think its part of a broader industry trend, the weakness in the upfront, offline is now coming online or is what else specifically, what specifically is YouTube doing to kind of better capture those dollars and then Ruth I know somebody ask you about that, logical follow-on question is the cash returns and share repurchases and dividends and just I know its early days but your thoughts on and your collective thoughts, Google how you think about that over the next few years when if ever it make logical sense to do that? Thank you.
Omid Kordestani
I’ll start and hand it to Ruth. So its – I think it’s really combination of all of the strength of YouTube coming together it starts with having over a billion users nearly almost one-third of all people on the internet everyday watching hundreds of millions of hours on the services and that creates billions of views and as Ruth mentioned the growth in watch time on YouTube accelerated in this now up over 60% year-over-year the fastest we’ve seen in couple of years.
And I think we are doing it also much better job with our products in our sales force to not only deliver for the creators on YouTube and do a better job of helping them monetize their contents and at the same time, then highlighting that success to programs like Brandcast where advertisers, agencies see that dynamic audience and service and then with the advertising products be able to then show them the real benefits of advertising and the ways that they can measure its effectiveness. So it’s really all the pieces coming together for us and obviously we have a lot of work to do and we see still a lot of opportunity to enhance the service. So, I think you will see a lot of innovation coming from us both on the service front as well as on the advertising products.
Ruth Porat
Hey, Mark. As you noted, it is early days but the way I view any assessment of a return on capital for my prior answer regarding balance sheet efficiency is really in the context of maximizing stakeholder value over the medium to long-term.
And with return of capital it gets into the context of, how do you prioritize and allocate cash after an appropriate reserve for working capital amongst the CapEx, M&A and then potentially that capital return. And as I said, the allocation decisions are mutually exclusive, the profitability of our business gives us many opportunities, but the main point is to date the weakest return on investment here has been in our core search business including mobile search as a result of both smart M&A and CapEx. Here M&A, we built a lot of the growth engines today, YouTube and DoubleClick are great examples. Again this underscores the power of smart targeted acquisitions.
We also have a strong track record of investment in new products as you know well and the infrastructure to support explosive growth, our tech infrastructure I've already commented on is really unparalleled and we do view it as a great strategic asset and we’ve invested in it substantially over many years. So trying to gauge whether or how capital returns fits in, it’s premature to do that and it’s really looking across these various potential uses.
Mark Mahaney
Thank you, Ruth. Thank you, Omid.
Ruth Porat
Thanks Mark.
Omid Kordestani
Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Okay, operator, we will take our next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the question. Omid, you mentioned retail travel is through the stronger verticals advertising front and in the recent past, you guys have made a number of announcements around products that align your interest or more closely with suppliers, people who try closing the economic loop and you might be even moving down the funnel. How do you think about the opportunities for Google to sort of move down respective finals and industries where you do you already have a fair bit of expertise? Thanks.
Omid Kordestani
Sure. Thanks, Eric for the question. We’re really focused on connecting retailers to consumers across screens and also reducing this friction involved in finding and purchasing products. All including local products and stores. So that entire journey and all the aspects of commerce is a great area of focus for us. And as users begin to – as they search, start their searches on mobile phones, we are continuously trying to find ways to improve their mobile shopping experience.
And as shopping experiences on these smart phones become easier and we focus on improving mobile conversion for advertisers. We are seeing great benefits from that, we just announced purchases on Google, for example, the smartphone only feature of the product listing ads an example. And again all of these are really for us the building blocks to help in reduction of that friction and bring the expertise we have and that understanding the immediacy, the local nature of these searches and understanding conversion and how to kind of put it all together for users, and for advertisers and machines.
Ruth Porat
Okay, operator we’ll take our next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Douglas Anmuth
Great thanks. Just to follow-up a little bit on the last one, Omid can you talk more specifically about the cross-platform efforts and estimated conversions in particular and whether you’re seeing that prove more of the value across the platform.
And then secondly, you commented several times that the gap is tightening on pricing between mobile and desktop, can you quantify that by any chance and can you just talk about what you think drives that to tighten further, go forward? Thanks.
Omid Kordestani
Sure, I’ll have Ruth take that second part. On the first part on this online to offline conversion efforts, we obviously know that mobile activities are influencing offline behavior and we’re very busy investing in new dynamic products that help bring mobile users to stores. We’re seeing strong results from clients using our tools to bridge this digital and physical world. And great adoption of local inventory ads, which help advertisers promote their store items to nearby shoppers. So again that’s how the whole cycle of usage of smartphones and the immediacy come together.
And then we’ve created way for advertisers to measure the impact of these ads on store visits. So just to give you a couple of examples, Target, one of our advertisers found that mobile search ads greatly influence in-store store sales and using our store visit data they found that a third of their paid search ads resulted in a user visiting a target store during 2014 holiday season. So we love to continue working with them and other advertisers to show the results and then build on that.
Florida department store working with us found that 63% of their mobile influenced sales take place off-line. And so more and more we’re doing these studies, we’re putting the tools together for these advertisers and our partners, the merchants and finding ways for them to really quantify these benefits and just scale these programs for everyone.
Ruth Porat
And then as it relates to the second part of your question there are really two good stories here given the importance of search. Mobile CPCs up and desktop CPCs not declining so the gap is narrowing. On the mobile side as Larry said before with respect to desktop it took time to fully develop the pricing model and we remain focused on building the mobile ecosystem to have the right ad formats and measurement to take advantage of all the platform ads to offer features like estimated store visits, app install, the rengagement ads, cross device conversions are all part of this strategy.
And then on desktop, the business continues to grow. It remains a good contributor to overall results as we announced that the AdWords performance Summit in May ongoing developments in rich and useful ads that work across all screams including desktop, enable us to deliver the right answers for our users in the right moment in other words, ads format that accelerate time to conversion on both mobile and desktop and that’s what’s really narrowing this gap here.
Douglas Anmuth
Great, thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thank you. Operator, we’ll take our next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Anthony DiClemente
Hi, thanks a lot for taking my question. Ruth given your background, I just want to ask if you thought the regulatory backdrop for Google is in anyway analogous to the financial services industry and sort of what is your outlook for a larger player like Google in an environment of increasing regulatory pressure, particularly outside the U.S. and of course specifically for Google with the EC demanding changes to the search results, just wondering should we be concerned that that these regulatory pressures can ultimately have an impact on your business. Thanks.
Ruth Porat
Let’s see, the industries are different, but as it comes to our business Google operates in a very competitive environment, there are many windows on to the web, choice, competition, investment are all going up, not down and we do look forward to continuing to work constructively with the EC to address any concerns they may have and regulators generally.
Anthony DiClemente
Okay, thank you very much.
Ruth Porat
Thank you. Operator, we’ll take our next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brian Nowak
I have two. The first one, Ruth, is going back to your comments on some of the earlier stage projects fiber life science that [indiscernible] focused on tight governance. Is there anyway you can kind of help us to think about OpEx or CapEx related to those projects at this point and how we should think about maintenance versus investment in OpEx and CapEx going forward? And then the second one just going back to the accelerating U.S. revenue growth, it sounds like mobile and YouTube are both doing pretty well. Can you just help us understand or are you seeing both accelerate – is U.S. search accelerating at this point or is it more so being driven by YouTube? Thanks.
Ruth Porat
Sure, so let me take your first question – first part of your question first. In terms of overall kind of the framework for thinking about our businesses broadly, I think a valuable framework to use is one that Eric and Larry have referred to for many years, namely the 70/20/10, 70% resources on the core 20% on adjacent areas, one point that included Chrome and Android and they are now in the core but it would include things like cloud and then 10% in additional new exciting opportunities in really sizable markets like Viber or what we’re doing with Google Life Sciences.
And so in discussing this with Larry its clearest objective has been to instill within the culture this mission to drive not just important innovation associated with our core business but also to look for as he call them revolutionary ideas, big solutions that can meaningfully contribute both to making peoples life better into the next big revenue and earnings growth opportunity for Google.
And my take is that Larry gives the 70/20/10 as an instructive framework he is also noted how hard is it to reach that 10% on these big new revolutionary ideas, because it’s tough to get people to tackle big difficult new problems and start pursuing incremental change. So human nature sort of provides a limit on how big that final bucket would be the new opportunities and I think the other point to consider is the Google’s core business continues to deliver strong growth. So to achieve 10% in the big new areas means continually trying to reach 10% of an even larger number.
And the framework keeps us focused on big ambitions across the company but given the success of the core business I think its fair to say the 10% is a stretch goal for now and it’s a way to think about resources which hopefully helps you fill in a bit there. And then the second part of your question if you could repeat that.
Brian Nowak
Yes. We just going back to the accelerating overall U.S. revenue. Just curious about a little more color on the drivers there were, its sounds like both YouTube and mobile search are doing pretty well. Is it safe to say that U.S. search and YouTube are both accelerating or you seeing YouTube driver is proportionate how should we think about the drivers of the U.S. revenue acceleration?
Ruth Porat
Well, you’ve covered a lot of it, the U.S. growth really reflects the fact we have diverse set of products that are doing well, we had strengthen core search particularly mobile, we had strengthen YouTube and programatic as Omid talked about. So it’s really the breadth across a number of different products that deliver the results that you are talking about, that we are talking about here today.
Brian Nowak
Thanks.
Ruth Porat
Thank you.
Ellen West
Operator, we’ll take our next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Heather Bellini
Great. Thank you so much. I just had two quick questions. I was just wondering you talked a lot about desktop and mobile CPCs. I was wondering if you could share with us if the narrowing of the gap between the two was actually starting to accelerate. And then the other thing I wanted to ask is just thinking about the CapEx spending made that companies go through and clearly Google been on one on an accelerated spending way for the last few years, should we then suggest – get from your comments are you were in a digestion period that the digestion period could also be a multi-year trend as well, if there is any thoughts you could share there. Thank you.
Ruth Porat
You know I think with respect to the first part of your question, we thought it was important to be clear that this gap is narrowing and to give you a sense of some of the mix issues within CPCs. So mobile, CPCs strengthening desktop not declining, YouTube remains lower, but we’re seeing real strong growth in TrueView. And so it’s just really to try in dimension that if you think about what’s going on with the mix change.
And then as it relates to expenses, what I was trying to convey there is that we – in the second quarter had a bit of a digestion period here on the back of the substantial investment spend that we’ve had and I would say in terms of – if you kind of think about the second quarter in that context, there can be some variability in the cadences spend.
And so a part of it as we’re talking about the CapEx here is how spend has phased during the year, I wouldn’t suggest that we’re talking about – as the way you frame the question, this multi-period given the sheer scope of opportunities that we have. So as I said again with the front-ends with respect to both CapEx and OpEx, we’re just beginning the 2016 budgeting process. We’re very focused on prioritization, but I was trying to give you some context for what was going on in the second quarter.
And then as it relates to OpEx in terms of the back half of the year, there are seasonal fluctuations that do typically impact operating expense as well. For example, headcount usually picks up in the third quarter with new grad hire starting and our marketing expense also tends to be weighted towards the second half of the year. So again I was trying to give you a sense of what’s the cadence as you’re thinking about the year.
Heather Bellini
Great, thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thank you. We’ll take our next question please, operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from Robert Peck from Suntrust. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Robert Peck
I had two questions if you don’t mind. The first is around possibility of working more directly with Yahoo on search and search results. Could you tell us about any progress there, work you’ve done there? And then number two, Ruth, could you talk about the future possibly breaking out more information around your businesses to a point where maybe we’d breakout YouTube or DoubleClick or some of these other businesses that could give investors a little more clarity on the size and growth of them? Thank you.
Omid Kordestani
I’ll take the first part. So Yahoo is currently testing search results and adds some number of partners including Google as one of their options. And they have options to use search services and search ads across your properties and you may see our ads. And so it’s a standard agreement and many other publishers use our Web search and AdSense for search. We look forward to working with them and hopefully having a good performance for them.
Ruth Porat
And then in terms of the second part of your question, I think, it’s important to help our stakeholders understand how we think about key drivers of the business and how we manage the business, providing what I call a framework for understanding the momentum in the business, our investment choices, our capital allocation decision making. I’m committed to being direct with you. I won’t give you competitively sensitive information, but my goal is to help you understand the business as well as possible.
And in my view it’s our obligation to pursue activities that maximize value over the long-term and doing it in a disciplined fashion. And the point I'm really trying to drive here is I aim to create a framework that helps you understand where we’re going. So you’re asking what we think about breaking out any particular business, I’m trying to understand how best to provide more insight into the drivers of the business and beyond what is currently provided and it’s really too early to be more specific than that.
Robert Peck
Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Operator, we’ll take our last question please.
Operator
And our last question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Paul Vogel
Great, thank you. Two questions on YouTube. One, there’s been a lot of speculation in the past about the profitability of YouTube. So I’m just sort of curious how you think about the revenue growth versus kind of the forward spend on forward demand and if YouTube in a position where it's starting to see leverage on the upside with the strong revenue growth. And then on the revenue side, in particular where you talk about how YouTube has been sort of – it’s one of the things that's drag the optics of CPC down. When mobile was doing that I think the company believe that over time mobile would be additive and we’re starting to see, but it took some time. How do you think about YouTube in the context of is there a point in time you think YouTube will actually be additive to sort of the optics of CPC versus where it is right now? Thank you.
Ruth Porat
So I think there was three parts to that question. In terms of the revenue growth in YouTube, Omid hit a number of them, but we continue to have strong growth there and it really does reflect as he said the sheer volume of users we have over a billion users. And those users are spending more time watching and watch time growth continues to accelerate now up over 60% year-over-year, the fastest rate we’ve seen in two years and we do view watch time as most valuable measure of engagement. And it does reflect the ongoing improvement in ads quality with more users also choosing to watch more TrueView ads not only do we have a huge user base that’s highly engaged, but data points like the fact there are more 18 to 49 year olds on mobile YouTubes and watching cable TV today really underscores the opportunity here. And our focus is the opportunity to get larger budgets, move to YouTube.
And then in terms of the profitability question, as you know we don’t breakout profit by product and we view our technical infrastructure as a core strategic asset that supports products across the company, I have already said that on this call that is an important point. It is fair to say that much of the network expenses that supporting YouTube, it’s a large user of capacity and our ability to serve high quality HD video on demand around the world is unparalleled. From the users’ perspective, YouTube is a great example of a multi-device platform with high usage on both desktop and mobile. We have one ad team that works across our various products and when we work with the largest ad partners globally, we’re selling a total package.
Omid’s comment on some of that, not surprisingly if you take our top advertisers, they all advertise across all our products, not necessarily the same rate, but we have a single team working with them to close the differential. We do view that as a great opportunity. And the goal, to give just a bit more color on how some of our assets and technical infrastructure and ad sales team benefit a number of our different products across the company. And then I think you slipped a third part in there on the status of – that kind of the CPC trends and YouTube TrueView pricing, so I will disclose out on that.
CPC pricing on YouTube for TrueView ads, ads that users choose not to skip is lower than on CPC pricing on desktop and mobile, but YouTube TrueView ads represented a larger percentage of our overall clicks, so had a greater impact on CPCs. And this is really about the tremendous growth in YouTube views. And not – you know again, when we see the real uptake here and the extent to which users are choosing to watch more ads given our effort around ad relevance and quality, advertisers want to reach these audiences. And our focus is on the opportunity to get larger budgets move to YouTube.
Paul Vogel
Okay, thank you.
Ruth Porat
Thank you. Okay, and with that, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Ellen. Hello, everyone. I want to say at the outset that this quarter, Google turned a strong performance, and this despite substantial currency headwinds. As we have all seen, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, which resulted in a gross negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.1 billion for the quarter.
Even after the significant benefits of our hedging program, the net impact to our gross revenue was still $795 million. If these currency trends persist, FX headwinds would obviously continue to impact our results in 2015. So for our results now, our gross total consolidated revenue was $17.3 billion, growing 12% year-over-year and declining 5% quarter over quarter.
Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth is in fact a healthy 17% year-over-year. Despite significant FX pressure, Google site revenue was up a healthy 14% year-over-year to $11.9 billion and was down 4% quarter-over-quarter. Once again, strength in mobile search was the key driver of growth here.
Network revenue was up 1% year-over-year at $3.6 billion and down 8% quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, our network businesses includes two businesses with two different growth profiles: our legacy AdSense business and our newer display and programmatic business where the latter continues to perform quite well.
This quarter, we reclassified some revenues, primarily related to double-click ad serving software from the other revenue to network revenue line. This reclassification increased network revenue by approximately $130 million in Q1 and decreased other revenue by about the same amount, or the same amount. The display and programmatic business, as I mentioned earlier, continued as always to be reflected in the network line. To see the impact of this re-class on historical periods, please see the earning's slides on our IR website.
Finally, Google's other revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $1.8 billion and was down 2% quarter-over-quarter. It was driven really by year-over-year growth by the Play Store, offset by declines at Nexus and what I have mentioned the FX impact. Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 13% year-over-year, down 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate CPCs were down 7% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. And on our monetization by property, Google sites paid clicks were up 25% year-over-year, down 3% quarter-over- quarter. Google sites CBCs were down 13% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter.
Network paid clicks were down 12% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter, and network CPCs were up 2% year-over-year and down 11% quarter-over-quarter. As you know, we don't usually break down the impact of the individual factors on the quarterly changes in our clicks and CPCs. But this quarter, I want to provide more color on what's happening within our sites, clicks, and CPC metrics so that you can better understand the dynamics of the underlying businesses that drive them.
So many commentators are incorrectly assuming that the growth trends in our sites, clicks, and CPCs are primarily due to difficulties monetizing search on Mobile, but that's in fact not the case. Remember that sites metrics includes clicks and revenues related to ads served and Google's and on properties, most notably, obviously, Google.com, but as well as YouTube, engagement ads like TrueView, where users choice not to skip an ad is counted as a click.
While over the past year, we have seen YouTube viewership claimed dramatically both in established markets but also due to rapid expansion in emerging markets, and quality improvements in the TrueView ads mean that more users are in fact choosing not to skip them, increasing the overall ad view.
So this means that there is much higher volume of TrueView ads being seen, which has been a significant driver of year-over-year growth in numbers that you have seen in site's clicks. True view ads currently monetize at lower rates than ad clicks on Google.com, but as you know, video ads generally reach people earlier in the purchase funnel and so across the industry, they tend to have a very different pricing profile than they would have on a typical performance search ad. Excluding the impact of YouTube TrueView ads, growth in site clicks would be lower, but still positive, and our CPCs would be healthy and growing year-over-year. So really, we have two positive stories to tell here today.
First, as I mentioned earlier, we're experiencing real strength in mobile search, and the CPCs in core Search business is continuing to grow year-over-year, so it's doing very well. Second, viewership in YouTube videos and TrueView ads are growing significantly and YouTube's contribution to our advertising revenue continues to grow at a strong rate year-over-year. And we're really pleased with how the YouTube business is progressing. So that's the story.
Turning to geographic performance, you'll see in our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of the world, and show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
So despite large currency headwinds, as I mentioned, we saw solid performance for our core Advertising business all around the world. The U.S. was up 11% year-over-year to $7.4 billion. The U.K. was up 6% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. And in fixed FX terms, the U.K. actually grew 12% year-over-year. Our non-U.S. revenue, which excluding the U.K., was up 14% year-over-year to $8.2 billion, accounting for 47% of our total revenue. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of the world grew a solid 24% year-over-year.
Now let me turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion for the quarter, or 22% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other costs of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1, which excludes SBC. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $5.4 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation.
As a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was a healthy $5.7 billion, and non-GAAP operating margins, 33% in Q1. Headcount was up just over 1,800 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 55,400 full-time employees at Google. Our effective tax rate was 22% for Q1.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $157 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging programs. For more details on OI&E, please do refer to the slides that accompany this call on the IR website.
We're pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion. This quarter, most CapEx spend was related to first product, production equipment, data center construction and facilities, in that order. Clearly, our computing capacity is a strategic asset for us and that's why we're investing in it. But we innovate there, just like we do everywhere else. To give you an example, compared to five years ago, we can now deliver more than three times as much compute power for the same amount of power or money. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion. So once again, strong results in the core business as evidenced by our 17% fixed FX revenue growth this quarter, and solid margin. Now I would like to turn it to Omid to provide you more specifics on our successful performance of our core and new businesses, and then we'll turn it over to questions. Omid?
Omid Kordestani
Thank you, Patrick. Our teams turned in a great performance across our business this quarter. I thought I would switch up our typical format a bit this time around. So I'll quickly share some highlights, and then I want to talk more about growth areas that we are really focused on, mobile and branding.
Let's start with the rise of programmatic ad buying. It's an extraordinary change for the ads industry, and I want to point out that our investments in the DoubleClick platform continue to be a big positive for us. We recently made TrueView our skippable ad formats on YouTube, available through our DoubleClick suite, and we brought Internet-delivered TV content to our Ad Exchange through M Dialogue, a company we acquired last year.
Google Play is also growing fast, connecting developers and content providers with more than 1 billion people on Android devices around the world. Developers are building thriving businesses in our platform, and in February, we announced that over the past 12 months, we paid more than $7 billion to developers. We're honored to be partnering with them.
Our partner hardware ecosystem is also doing great. LG Watch, Urbain and Huawei Watch recently announced new Android wear devices, and Pioneer launched in-dash car units compatible with Android auto. Also, 10 top computer OEMs are now making more than 35 Chrome devices, available in 38 countries, so they're great momentum for us.
Google for Work continues to grow at an impressive pace, thanks to the addition of customers like G4S, one of the world's largest private-sector employers, who move 70,000 of their employees to drive for work. Working with our partners, we also recently launched android for work to accelerate the general adoption of android devices in the work place. Business is going great in these areas, and we continue to invest to capture the potential we see for growth.
Now I want to talk more about the two areas were a see a lot of opportunity for us. First, the shift to mobile, and then the trend of TV budgets shifting to digital. Mobile devices are driving the huge shift in the way people consume media. You've heard about the trends many times. Here is our point of view. As we all know, consumers reach for their phones a lot, and some of these moments matter more than others, like when people are looking for answers or making a decision about what to buy or do.
For example, more than eight in 10 smart phones users use their phone one to research a product decision they're about to make in a store. These moments include small things like looking for a movie review, and really big decisions like researching a new home purchase or figuring out what car you want to buy next.
So people expect to get exactly what they want, when they want it. As a company built on intent and immediacy, that's good news for Google. Our job has always been to connect people with what they are looking for in the exact moment they are looking. Our ad products are a critical way we've delivered the right answers and the right moment, and it's something we do really well. It's often more valuable to know someone is shopping for a new SUV than it is to know basic demographic information about them.
We have great opportunities in mobile with some of the most popular mobile apps including the Google app, YouTube, Gmail and Maps, and our great android platform. Search is also important to the mobile experience. We have re-tooled our search engine for mobile, providing direct answers enabling voice queries. It's really a delightful experience. Try opening the Google app and asking what's the plot of the Godfather movie or flip a coin. You will be pleasantly surprised.
Chrome for mobile is also a popular app with more than 400 million users and, of course, a large number of people use it as a primary way to search the web. We continue to invest in proving the mobile web for both users and developers. In the recent chrome release, we made it easier for users to add their favorite sites to their phones home screens and get helpful opt-in notifications from sites they visit often.
We've also been working to index apps just as effectively as we index web content. We now have 30 billion links within apps indexed. And if you're looking for information that lives within an app that you don't have, we'll now begin showing links to install the app right under the searches all page. The Google app on android can also give you up-to-date – can also keep you up-to-date by servicing information from more than 40 different apps when it's relevant, like Pandora music recommendations on your commute, or a car to request a lift when you arrive at the airport.
We are also working very hard to make our products more accessible to the next billion people who are coming online. The first computing experience for these users won't see on a desktop machine or a laptop. They will be on a mobile phone from day on one. In fact, many of them will use a mobile device as their only computer. We launched android one, a new family of high quality, low-cost smart phones in Indonesia and the Philippines this quarter, making it available in a total of six emerging markets.
We're also working to eliminate the barriers to access from connectivity issues. For instance, in countries like India, where a user might have a slow wireless connection, we can deliver a fast loading light version of search so they can get their answers quickly and pay less for data. And with the chrome app for android and iOS, our data compression features help reduce data usage by up to 50% while browsing the web. There's tremendous upside to these efforts, and we're in a great position.
I'm also very excited about how we're helping marketers succeed in this mobile world. As I noticed earlier, we're connecting brands with the right people at the precise moment when it actually matters because of our strong, intense signals. Mobile also enables us to help drive the 90% of commerce that still takes place off-line, which is a massive opportunity that are partners are really excited about.
People are searching on Google for things like near me, closest, and nearby, twice as much as they did last year. Our local inventory ads are a great way for businesses to drive purchases in stores right when people are looking for local options. We also help advertisers better measure the store visits that their digital ads drive, and we recently expanded the capabilities to advertisers in new countries. Our ads are also driving people to download apps precisely when they are looking for them.
Our ad mobile ad network offers great targeting and reach and is the foundation of our app install offerings. Last month, we also introduced ad promotion video ads and extended app install ads to our mobile Google display network, which increased install volumes for early testers by an average of 28% without impacting cost for install. We also recently began testing sponsored search results within Google Play with a small set of users and developers, helping ad developers reach valuable users directly within the store.
So I am very excited about the Mobile future, and marketers are, too. Our pivot to mobile has great momentum and is delivering strong benefits to users and advertisers. I also feel very excited about the trend of video content and TV budgets shifting to digital. YouTube is the world's most popular video service on all screens, with hundreds of millions of hours watched on YouTube every day. The place where 1 billion people come to watch video is a natural home for video advertising budgets. When people come to YouTube, they come the intent of watching video, so it's the perfect time to reach them with a video ad, not when they are distracted by something else. More and more, brands are seeing the value reaching audiences on YouTube two, with the number of TrueView advertisers growing by 45% in 2014.
YouTube drives great results, and we can measure the impact. We have run over 6,000 brand live studies to date across some of those largest brand advertisers, and in studies we have run for Google preferred campaigns, we found that 94% of the campaigns we studied drove a significant lift an average of 80% in ad recall. That's why we're bringing it back this year and expanding it to more than 10 new markets. Google Preferred is also attracting some of the biggest TV advertisers to YouTube. More than 30 major brands that have never advertised on YouTube before signed on with Google preferred and saw such great results that they have continued to advertise with YouTube afterwards. YouTube is home to great content and engaged audiences, and we're seeing the natural shift of TV budgets.
So those are some of my observations on the trends affecting our business, what I'm hearing from partners and why I'm upbeat on the opportunities ahead. You will see a lot more at our brand cast up-front in Europe next week at the AdWords performance Summit in early May and our I/O developer conference in late May. We look forward to seeing you there. Before I go, I want to thank all the Googlers worldwide for a great quarter, and I want to say a special thank you to Patrick, who has been our fearless CEO from almost seven years and who wrote one of the most heartfelt and awesome retirement notes I've ever seen. If you have read it, you'll know that he was inspired to move on after climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. I've since then traveled to Kilimanjaro for all Googlers recommending local deals near their homes.
Patrick, you will be dearly missed. We wish you and your wife all the best on your new venture. Thank you. And, Ruth, if you are out there listening, we can't wait to begin working with you soon. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Omid, and absolutely true for Ruth as well. Candace [ph], why don't you give us the instructions to turn on the Q&A?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from line of Carlos Kirjner of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Carlos Kirjner
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. First, our research has suggested that many or maybe most mobile websites and mobile apps are still in pretty bad shape when it comes to user experience and conversion. I think one can expect these to improve over time. The question is, is an improvement in conversion rate and experiences within mobile apps, where users transact good or bad for Google? One could argue that people are going to spend more time in apps, transacting apps and not search. How should we think about that? Secondly, it's been more than two years since when we've seen the capital intensity very high. It continues to be quite high with $2.9 billion of CapEx. Is this the new normal? Is that what should we expect going forward? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Omid, do you want to take the first one? I'll take the second one.
Omid Kordestani
Sure. Thank you, Carlos, for the question. We are actually very excited about improvements of these mobile websites. And we really are happy to see where we can deliver the best answers to our users whether it be through an app or whether we find it on the web. We're working with developers, webmasters, publishers really serve their content to users in the format they feel best and we also recently introduced this install app, Install Carousel, which is evidence of that effort. So it's really about delivering the right results for the users and the less friction you have there and the more targeted you are, we'll see the benefits and monetization.
On the other side, Carlos, on the CapEx side. We are far from surprised from these numbers internally. Part of our plan, we are shifting as you know, we've been building a lot of data centers over the last 18 months. And so that is actually giving us the opportunity to put in new equipment in. And we are jumping on the opportunity. Thinking through the total cost of ownership of these things and the much more higher efficiency of these new machines. Having said that, I won't kind of comment about future, but I just want to reemphasize that we are not surprised by these numbers. To us, actually, they make sense given our strategy. And they really fuel all the innovations that we have going for us. So it's an important part of our strategy. It's a strategic asset.
Carlos Kirjner
Thank you.
Omid Kordestani
Thanks, Carlos, for your question. Candace, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney
Thanks, Patrick. Thanks for all the additional color on the paid clicks and the CPCs. So just so we step back a little bit because there are many of us who thought it really was driven mostly by mobile. Is there a point to your assertion that these real major shifts that we've seen over the last two or three years in CPC pressure has really largely been driven by you YouTube true views in the adoption of that? Is that kind of the point you're making? And if you would – in the past, you always listed the factors that would cause the shifts in pay clicks and CPCs. Could you just check off what the other items are, and put them in order of priority. What's moving those two wheels? Take you.
Patrick Pichette
Yes, Mark. Thank you for your question. And in fact, that's why I made the comments I made today. I'm just talking about the situations as we have it now. I'm not looking back to prior years, I'm just saying what we have seen in this quarter and the last quarter. We're just seeing a real acceleration at YouTube, and that's why we thought it was important because we saw this change.
From the fundamental kind of strong performance of YouTube, both in terms of its coverage and in terms of the performance, like even the TrueView ads, right? We tuned these ads to make sure that people want to watch them so that they are very effective, and when they do, then people watch a lot more of them. And so over the last quarter, over the last couple of quarters, we've seen the real takeoff and then the geographic expansion is kind of giving us a lot more coverage.
So it's a real positive story for YouTube, because we see it now, we're reporting now. So it's not a view back to the last five years at all. I just wanted to kind of clarify that. So thank you for your question.
Mark Mahaney
Okay. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Candace? Let's go to our next question.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas Anmuth
Thanks for taking the question. Omid, I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more on the mobile search changes that are taking place. Talk a little bit more about what you think the key factors are here and the key differences, and whether that impact is an actual result of actual monetization. And then, Patrick, just on the margins and costs in the quarter, non-GAAP operating margin is basically flat from a year ago, so trying to understand how much you think that was a factor of one-time items a year ago, or a change at all in terms of your view on cost discipline within the business? Thanks.
Omid Kordestani
Thanks, Douglas. So with mobile phones really becoming such a primary way people search the net. Our goal is really to help people search, find the content that's not just relevant and timely but also really easy to read and interact with on these smaller devices and smaller screens. And it's important to note that this is just one of over 200 signals we use to evaluate the best results.
Non-mobile friendly sites won't disappear from the mobile searches. They'll still rank high if they hold great content that the user wants. But the lack of mobile friendliness is a problem for web publishers, because that is abandon the websites and that's a real issue. So really early to speculate exactly how the monetization impact of these organic algorithm changes will be. But we always start with the user to deliver the right answer, the best answer, be it on the mobile web or the app. And that we think that ultimately that's good for publishers, advertisers and our users and the monetization success will follow.
Patrick Pichette
Great. And so, Douglas, on my side, if you look at it, I mean, we're really pleased with Q1. If you look at the operating profit of the company, right? Despite from Q4 to Q1 revenue trends that are always seasonal, we delivered essentially the same $5.7 billion of non-GAAP operating profits for the quarter. So we're really focused on our sequential performance rather than what happened a year ago, and there was no real specific one-time items in this quarter. This was a pretty clean quarter. We're very happy with it. Thank you, Douglas for your question.
Douglas Anmuth
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Candice, let's go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just go back to your comments on splitting YouTube out from the CPCs and paid clicks, you mentioned paid click growth would be lower excluding YouTube. Would you be willing to help us understand that growth rate – what looks like now, what it looked like a year ago? And on the CPCs, you mention the search CPCs continue to grow. Is that true even including migration into emerging markets where CPCs are lower and in the shift towards Mobile?
Omid Kordestani
So we don't – look, I, what I wanted to do today's clarify the issue between YouTube and our kind of.com properties rather than to go into all of the details. You've seen in my notes of my comments that the impact of TrueView and site CPCs, site CPCs would be growing, a right, if you kind of take out the TrueView ad impact. And I've also noted that mobile search is continuing on the path of strength.
So from that perspective, what I wanted to make sure of is that you get the color that if you just exclude the great growth of YouTube, but it has very different kind of fundamental dynamics, that the core of what is typically search performance both on Mobile and Desktop, the combined, is doing really good, and the CPCs would be growing if you take the effect out. So that's really what I want to make sure of, so people don't continue to hound on this issue. Is more about mobile that has terrible monetization. In fact, there's a good story there, too. Thank you for your question.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open.
Ben Schachter
First, Patrick, congratulations on a great run at Google and enjoy the future bike rides. A couple of questions. Can you talk about how you think Google Wallet needs to evolve to better compete with ApplePay and others? Are you beginning to see acquisitions in that space or will it be more organic? And then Patrick, any updated thoughts on how Google is viewing its cash balances? Are you going to return some of that cash before you leave? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
It's all – the easy answer is really for Omid, so let him take that one and then I will talk about the cash issues.
Omid Kordestani
Sure. On ApplePay, again, I think it's just really great that the industry is really opening up here and that the merchants, the banks, consumers, are all starting to experience this. And our focus is really to bring this set of new APIs for payments, and call it Android Pay, and that our goal has always been to remove much of the friction that our users encounter today on everyday shopping experiences. And so we're excited about what the industry is doing here and what the user adoption is going to be kind we're working with all the partners to put all the pieces together and finally create the momentum that we are all looking forward to benefit from.
Patrick Pichette
And on my side, Ben, I have no news on the cash issue. I will just reiterate what I've said many times, because I think that not only is it true, but it's important, that we do bring this issue to the attention of the audit community, the board; there are regular debates about this issue. And it's a balance between cash being the strategic asset and then the question that we ask ourselves also in our conversations and deliberations is do we have a pipeline of opportunities that would make us believe that we would actually widely invest this kind of money, and in that sense it's very clear that the debates we're having will continue, but we have no further updates for you on that issue.
Ben Schachter
Good luck in the future.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Ben. Will go to our next question, Candace.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heather Bellini
Great. Thank you for the question and congratulations, Patrick. I just wanted to follow up on your YouTube comments earlier. You talked about the growth you've been seeing in particular over the last couple of quarters. I'm just wondering when you are talking to advertisers, kind of what's changed over the last year or so that you really think has caused this acceleration and kind of click volume that you are seeing, and how do you think about that gap and the potential for that gap to close over time with what you see in just traditional site CPCs, if you will? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So I'll take the technical side of it, and then I will let kind of Omid give you more on the color of what's exciting at YouTube. Related to the question, and the answer I gave you, the comments I gave you today, it's really about if you think about it, about coverage rather than the new product, because we've done a lot of geographic expansion of YouTube, and that in itself gives you a lot more volume out there in terms of eyeballs.
And then in addition to that, we've through the great work of the team and the AdWords team and the YouTube team, the monetization team, making sure that a TrueView is a more efficient product where people, basically they actually do watch the entire ad, and so they don't skip the four to five seconds. And all you need is given the scale of YouTube today, right, all you need is to have a product that people want more and it actually delivers a lot more value.
So in terms of advertising total revenue. The fact that it's at the top of the funnel clearly has very different dynamics than when you have a very specific performance based ad that is tied to very specific high-margin query. But that doesn't mean that it's not incredibly useful for advertisers, because that's where they start is at the top of the funnel. So these are all the pieces of the puzzle that we have going for us. And for what's really exciting about YouTube, I will let Omid kind of give you more color comment on this.
Omid Kordestani
Hi, Heather. First of all, I invite you to come to Grant Cast next week, I'll be there in New York, and you'll get a sense of the momentum in YouTube. But really the way we look at it is as usual, we first look at the users. One third of all people on the Internet are everyday watching, hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube. This is generating billions of views. And then when we look at our advertisers, they want to be there. So we're seeing a strong growth in TrueView with new advertisers. The number grew 45% in 2014. And all of the top 100 global brands have run TrueView ads over the past year.
And as they are experiencing success, for example, with Google preferred, I think I shared this stat earlier, but 95% of the preferred campaigns that we studied drove a significant lift, an average of 80%. And then more than 30 brands that were new to advertising on YouTube use Google preferred, and then came back and continued to advertise with us afterwards. So just having great success.
Patrick Pichette
So, Heather, it's a good story all-around. We are pretty pleased by it, obviously. Thank you for your question. Candace, we'll go to our next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the questions, and I will echo the sentiment, congrats, Patrick on the decision, and best of luck going forward. My questions is more around mobile. I appreciate all the color around the clicks and that CPC, but maybe you could talk a little bit either qualitatively or quantitatively about the way in which mobile advertising, especially search, is evolving overtime and whether some of the gaps that we used to talk about one or two years ago are starting to close in terms of monetization, whether it be dictated by screen sizes or people getting more comfortable. Or maybe some of the changes you will be making around mobile search with some of the ranking that we've seen in the Commonwealth tech this week. We’d look to get some color about how you've seen mobile evolve and how you see it evolving going forward. Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Sure. Let me just give you some thoughts, and thank you for this. We are very excited about this pivotal mobile and it's really obviously a shift that started gradually and it's been very dramatic for us. So if you talked to every product manager at Google, and leader at Google, they have it at the forefront of their thoughts and how to delight the users, how to improve the experience, same thing on our advertising front. I think so one is obviously the efforts we're doing for the discovery, the search for information, be it in the apps or be it on mobile web. The other aspect of this that is really going to help us obviously with the monetization front, is the improvements in measurements. Measuring cross devices, measuring in-store sales.
And as you know, the end of shopping experience becomes more powerful because users can find this information, they can find it with local products. It doesn't become just about driving leaps to online retailers, it's about driving traffic to off-line stores via mobile. And we're seeing great adoption from retailers, from Macy's, REI Sears. So what should really – the way we're going to talk about this kind and you're going to hear us talk more about this is this intent and immediacy that we're so good at, given our heritage in search. And we are just applying all of that knowledge and all of that experience we have in ads and search to improving this mobile experience and how we monetize. Thank you.
Omid Kordestani
Thanks, Eric. Candace, our next question, please?
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Eisner [ph] . Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. Can you hear me?
Patrick Pichette
We can. How are you Anthony.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. How are you, Patrick? Congratulations, and best wishes on your next endeavors. A couple of questions. First, I want to ask about Maps and Waves. I mean, it seems to me like those are very strategic assets and businesses where Google has a competitive advantage.
So can you just talk about the progress and user experiences with Maps and the opportunity going forward for the contribution to the business from those platforms? And then secondly, Patrick, given your telecom background, can you just please describe for us the strategy around Project Five that was announced this week? How does that connect back to the other Google Access initiatives like Google Fiber? And maybe just talk about the longer-term vision there. Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Great. Do you want to jump in first?
Omid Kordestani
Yes, sure. This is Omid. Thank you for the question. On Maps, we absolutely agree with you – very strategic, very popular, and that there are more than 1 billion active users of the Google Map services. We've mapped the world, as you know, 200 countries and territories, including North Korea. 1 billion times the app has been downloaded on android and lots and lots of stats to go through. I think one of the things we're doing is not only to improve that experience and integrate it as much as it make sense throughout the services, and whenever users can take advantage of the signals and the proper response from Google.
But the other side of this is also partnering. One of the things we're really actively doing is partnering on our Map service in native formats with as many partners out there that can take advantage of it. So it's a scenario we're really investing in, we are very excited about it and we have great traction, and we're also happy to offer it to our partners, and you will see us both in terms of Maps and Waves, you'll see it getting integrated in other popular web services out there.
Patrick Pichette
Great. On my side, look, there's quite a different rationale if you think of Fiber versus Access, which is really kind of asset-based. We've just, as a reminder to some of our – you may have heard – we just announced Fiber yesterday, so it's still very early days. It's focus on innovating and conductivity and communications but in ""partnership"" with carriers in the U.S., hardware makers. And we are trying to see again from users perspective and from a service perspective with or without assets what should look like the next wave of innovation.
So we've always, if you're always looking to make the web faster, cheaper, more available, and we wanted to try this new vision, this new idea of fast and easy wireless service, and then work with the ecosystem of our carriers, so that's why we have T-Mobile and Sprint as well as large carriers and manufacturers and developers to develop this kind of new product, new and innovative service. So, different in the sense that Anthony and in the case of Fiber or in the case of Loon it's really asset-based. This one is really about services and how can we use today's platforms to actually just drive for more innovation?
So that's really the difference, but we're pretty excited. It will be interesting to see the take rate and it will be interesting to see how the market response is to it. But again, very much as usual, kind of focused on innovation, focused on pushing the envelope. Thanks for your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Cool. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Stephen Ju
Patrick, bon voyage and best of luck with everything. So I'm trying to get some sense of the direction of costs involved in running YouTube? Granted, there's the revenue share component, the content owners, but then there's the everyday operating costs involved in just running the business like engineers, bandwidth, et cetera. So I'm wondering at this point what part of YouTube's cost base is variable and what part is fixed, because it seems like your revenue is now large enough to cover the costs to serve your users and the cost in the aggregate is probably not growing as rapidly as revenue.
And additionally, even as we adjust for the reclassification, I guess, of the double-click to network, the Eleanor line decelerated a bit more than we saw, so I'm just wondering if this just due to Play indexing higher against those countries, in spite of the highest amount of FX headwinds, or did you have some sort of hardware shortage issue this quarter also? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Okay. So let's start with the last one first, and then I'll come back to YouTube. On other revenues, what you have in there is, yes, you're right that we have the reclass, and then on the two other factors, clearly Play is going really well, but it is also hit by quite strong headwinds. So we are very pleased with the performance of Play, but given that it has not quite a large international SKU, it also kind of gets hit by headwinds of FX as well.
And then on the hardware side, no shortage this quarter so no shortage issues versus fixed so that's been performing quite well. But again, when you look at year-over-year comparisons for hardware, then last year, we had the new Nexus Seven tablet that was quite popular. Are you have quite a bit of noise on comparisons year-over-year. And that's really so you have the combination of these three things are flowing through the line. So that's why you end up with that kind of performance.
But what's most important is FX adjusted, we continue to be very, very pleased with the Play, the Play growth. On YouTube, I would interestingly, I mean, obviously, we don't divulge any of the details of what's fixed and was variable, and any of this. What I can tell you is we actually monitor the performance of YouTube for its profitability to make sure that it continues to grow profitably, and we basically kind of manage with Susan to reinvest at the right pace, if you will. So fueling the growth where it is showing up and keeping tight in areas where we need more efficiencies.
So that's where we managed again – I've said this in the past and I will say it again – if you just want to make YouTube profitable to more users, very easy, right? You put on the brakes on growth, and then it just turns into a profitable business. We continue to work with attention where Susan has the carrot of, hey, as much profitability as I can generate, I can reinvest at a certain base, so it creates a great incentive for this growth and disciplined behavior that we have there. So we are pretty pleased by it. Thank you so much for your question, Steven. Candace?
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line's open.
Ross Sandler
Great. I just had two quick follow-ups from the last question, and then one for Nikesh. So, Patrick, on the operating margin question, so given the increased discipline you talked about last call, do you think this flat margin is sustainable in 2015 and if not, what would cause it to drop back down year-on-year? And then from the prior question, so this new Other Revenue line was up like 23% in the quarter. I think it was like 19% or 20% last quarter. So surprising that the acceleration is in there given the FX trends. Can you just talk about is that Google Play or is that hardware between those two? And then for Nikesh, there has been some talk of Google introducing custom audience products for AdWords? Is that something you're willing to talk about and how big of a targeting future like that could be in terms of improving our lives and increasing spend and search?
Patrick Pichette
Okay. So, Ross, on my side, two points. One is on the issue of margin, you know we don't give guidance. So I can pronounce myself for the rest of 2015. But I think that in Q1, you see a good example of what we talked about when we had those comments in Q4, which is we drive for that right balance. That right balance of you want to fuel as much as possible responsibly, the growth of we have the areas where we want to invest, and in other areas, right, we may decide we're actually torque for efficiencies all the time.
And you see that in our Q1 results. In fact, I didn't mention it, but just a note on the head count. The vast majority of head count for Q1 is in fact engineers and project managers. It's not G&A. It's not sales. It's really focused on engineering, because that's what we wanted to put the emphasis. So I'm using this is an example of even though the numbers are large in a number of areas, there is actually a lot of science applied to every one of these numbers to make sure that we continue to drive for high efficiencies as much as we can.
You may have heard that in Q1, we canceled another program that we had, which was the Helpouts. So this program did not prove the promises that we had for it, and so we actually repurposed the team and shut down the entire initiative. So again, I'm just giving a signal that this is disciplined organization that looks at the facts that actually when it's not working, people can sense it, and then we have a good conversation about it, and then on the other side when we really see something kind of really going well, we want to make sure that we push hard for it.
In the case of the second piece that you've asked, which was the growth in Other Revenue, I think Play is doing very well. We are very happy about that. And yes, we're having good results on the Nexus Six, but year-over-year, it wasn't as strong as it would have given the strength of the Nexus Seven last year, so that's really been the big driver. And as for Nikesh, Nikesh I heard, is on his way to India right now. He was on a plane, but I have Omid here who would be delighted to answer your question.
Ross Sandler
Omid, I’m sorry about that.
Omid Kordestani
That's all right. No problem.
Ross Sandler
We all do that.
Omid Kordestani
People confuse us and Nikesh is at Soft right now. So, let's see, on these rumors about custom audiences. You know we are very much focused on completing the cycle of better targeting and measurement attribution, at all points of the funnel with our different products. We are not announcing any new products at this point, but we have a great number of targeting options interest intent location across all the services from performance to brand. And I think you will see us innovate here, and continue to innovate here. So thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Ross . And I didn't mean to pick on you. We all tripped over on occasion all the time. Easiest...
Ross Sandler
Write down the cash on my notes. Sorry about that.
Patrick Pichette
No worries. Candace, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Peter Stabler
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Patrick, thanks for all the color around the click information. It begs another question now, and given the frequency with which a lot of us misinterpret these numbers, and given the growing importance of brand advertising and the accompanying expansion of attribution and ROI modeling to measure impact beyond simple clicks. Wondering if these metrics have outlived their usefulness and weather you guys are considering a way to help us understand your success behind brand advertising going forward? Thanks very much.
Patrick Pichette
Well, look, we look at this on a regular basis. I mean, we just happen to see on the YouTube side so much change in the last kind of couple of quarters that we thought it was worth mentioning. I think it's served as well, and if we ever decide to look at different ways to look at the business and want to report it that way, we will let you know. For now, we have really no difference in changes in the way that we reported. So that's the short answer, Peter.
Peter Stabler
Okay. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
I think we have time for one last question. So why don't we take one last question before we close to call, Candace?
Operator
Thank you. And our last question come from the line of Mark May of Citi. Your line is now open.
Mark May
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. There's a few out there that consumer behavior is different on mobile versus desktop in terms of search and web usage versus apps. I'm wondering are you seeing that from your users as they shift from Desktop to mobile devices? I guess in that sense, is the growth in Mobile search activity offsetting the weakness that you may be seeing in desktop search? And then second question is just on verticals, by advertiser verticals. We had heard some data points during the quarter around potentially some weakness in the e-commerce category. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on maybe some verticals where you saw a particular strength and weakness? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Sure. Thank you, Mark, for the question. So let me just take the vertical one first in terms of performance. We definitely saw automotive and travel were stronger verticals this quarter. India was a strong performer as far as the geo goes for us. And those are really some of the areas that I could highlight. And I think in terms of this behavior change, we are really, really focused on studying it every day. I mean, the shift is very, very dramatic and that we are laser focused on being as good and relevant and fast and monetize well. All the things that we did on the desktop and continue to do on a desktop to do that on mobile.
So I think all I can say on that is that your right, behaviors are different. There's an immediacy having this device always with you, using it as your assistant, using your voice to make commands and getting results, using the maps and being in a moment of purchase decision. And as we rely on this information source to help you, so all of those things are really, really powerful, and we are very excited about it. It's a journey that we're all on and looking forward to doing a better job and to monetizing well.
Omid Kordestani
So thank you, Mark, for your question. Before I close, let me just kind of 10 seconds. First, Ruth will join us in about a month. We're really excited to have her. I will be here to help her in transition, but you will hear a much better voice in Q2 on the earnings call. So we're really looking forward to having her as part of the team. It, obviously, has been a delight to work at Google for the last seven years. I have kind of obviously three thanks, three huge thanks for that. First one is to the Google community, as Omid mentioned. All of these Googlers kind of are simply extraordinary individuals and people. These men and women, I mean, they just continue to develop the stream of innovation that is really changing the world and making it a better place. So it's been a real joy to work with every one of them.
My colleagues, I mean around this table. The IR team, as well as the executive group that I've kind of spent many, many hours over the years, and they're mostly friends now so thank you for your friendship and all of your warmth over the last few years.
And finally, you. I mean, the financial community, our shareholders. I mean, you've been kind of supportive, you've been probing, you've had the insights, you've been really with us, I mean, for the last seven years through kind of thick and thin as we've seen a lot of stuff come and go, and really a strong supporter for this a bit crazy, unconventional company. So I just need to thank you as well for all the great times together. With that, yes, I am going to grab my backpack and take off for the world. So you may see me somewhere in the world, and if you do, just please do stop and say hi. It'll be a delight to see you.
So with that, I'll let Candace close the call. Thank you so much, and we'll see you or Ruth will see you in Q2. Cheers.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Google Inc. Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded.
At this time I’d like to turn the call over to Ellen West, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ellen West
Thanks so much, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google’s fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Patrick Pichette and Omid Kordestani.
As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google’s future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and, as applicable, other special items. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Ellen. And welcome to 2015 everyone. Before we get into the numbers, I am going to give a brief overview of our performance this quarter, as the data is actually quite noisy through the P&L. So to start, let’s say, that we saw continued strength in our core advertising business. This was really driven by a strong holiday and mobile performance from our Sites line. We saw a great momentum in our programmatic business highlighted by our mobile display and our ads platform product. But we also faced a few real challenges as well.
On the revenue side, clearly as you heard out the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in a gross negative currency impact of $616 million just into Q4. But thanks to our hedging program the net impact was actually attenuated, with a net revenue impact of $468 million. Also on the Other Revenue line not only did we see that negative currency impact really impact the Play growth, particularly in Japan, but also while the Nexus 7 was very well received as a new phone, we had real issues and unable to secure sufficient inventory to meet the demand that we had forecasted. So for both these factors in fact, we see lower other revenue growth this quarter.
On the expense side, we had number of unusual charges to our operating expenses hit this quarter. I’ll provide you more details in a few minutes as we go through the conversation. But together these items added up to slightly over $300 million in expenses to our P&L.
Lastly, if you go through the CapEx line, you will note that we’ve made real estate purchases in Q4, which helped us relieve both pressure on our work space for current employees but also to accommodate our future growth. And this also resulted in a large sequential increase in our real estate capital expenditures this quarter. So now that you have the basics, why don’t we dive into the details?
Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $18.1 billion, and it was up 10% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations our gross consolidated revenue growth would have, in fact, been 18% year-over-year. And despite all the FX pressure our Google Sites revenue was up a healthy 18% year-over-year to $12.4 billion, was up 10% quarter-over-quarter, in part driven by the strength in our mobile search.
Network revenue was up 6% year-over-year at $3.7 billion and was up 8% quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, our network business includes really two types of businesses with different growth profiles, our legacy AdSense business, particularly AdSense for search, where we’ve continued to make policy changes for the benefit of our user experience, but which has negatively impacted the growth in clicks specifically.
Our clean-up efforts have resulted in fewer clicks, but also higher CPCs as I’ll discuss in a minute. The other business that in the network line are newer display and programmatic businesses including AdMob, AdExchange, DoubleClick Bid Manager, and these continue to grow at a strong rate. Finally, Google’s other revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $2 billion was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by year-over-year growth in our Play Store, but offset by the FX impact and the challenges in our hardware business I mentioned earlier.
Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 14% year-over-year, and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPCs were down 3% year-over-year and also down 3% quarter-over-quarter. And if we go on our monetization by property, the Google site paid clicks were up 25% year-over-year and up 18% quarter-over-quarter. With Google sites’ CPCs were down 8% year-over-year and down 8% quarter-over-quarter.
On the network side, network paid clicks were down 11% year-over-year and down 7% quarter-over-quarter, but our network CPCs were up year-over-year 6% and 10% quarter-over-quarter for the reasons I mentioned. Our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by a number of factors. They include geographic mix, device mix, property mix, FX, as well as ongoing product and policy changes.
Turning to geographic performance, if you go to our earning slides, which you’ll find on our Investor Relation website, you’ll see that we’ve broken down our revenues by US, UK and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. So despite large currency headwinds we saw solid performance from our core advertising business around the world. The US revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $7.9 billion. The UK was up 10% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. And in fixed FX term it actually grew to 11% year-over-year.
Non-US revenue excluding the UK was up 18% year-over-year to $8.6 billion, accounting for 47% of total revenue.
And in fixed FX terms in fact the rest of the world grew at healthy 24% year-over-year. So let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.6 billion or 22% of advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other costs of revenue was $3.1 billion in Q4, which exclude SBC as well. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $5.8 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation. And as a result our non-GAAP operating profit was $5.6 billion and non-GAAP operating margins were 31% in Q4.
As I mentioned at the beginning, we had a number of unusual operating expenses that impacted us this quarter. We typically review our estimates accounting policies and balance sheet on an ongoing basis and make adjustments when we think and see it necessary. Normally, I wouldn’t call out these, but because they totaled slightly over $300 million this quarter, I wanted to give you some sense of these adjustments, although I won’t be providing a lot of detailed break-out.
So first we took approximately half that amount in compensation charges resulting from a one-time payment and reclassification between SBC and bonus expense. The other half came from a review of our real estate portfolio, where we decide to take write-down on a small number of assets and also one-time payment to buy out a number of leases in a couple of markets where we face acute space pressure.
Headcount was up, but just over 2,000 in Q4. In total we ended the quarter with approximately 53,600 full-time employees. You’ll notice also that our effective tax rate was 16%, again another discrepancy for Q4, which was really, primarily impacted by the extension of the R&D tax credits for 2014 with the entire credit being taken in Q4. As well as continued mix shift from earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $128 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging programs. For more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We are pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.4 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion. And this quarter, most of the CapEx was spent on related to facilities, production equipment, and datacenter construction in that order. So as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we have been opportunistic about acquiring space in real estate where we need to relieve pressure and accommodate for future growth.
To that end, our facilities expenditure included just over $900 million of real estate investments during the quarter, of which $585 million was related to the acquisition of our property in Redwood City that we disclosed in our 10-Q for the third quarter.
Our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, and I also want to note that we completed in Q4 the sale of Motorola Mobile to Lenovo in October 29. We recognize a gain on disposition of $740 million net of tax, which is included in our net income from discontinued operations. So there you have it, despite a noisy quarter from a P&L perspective. We can say that we had strong results in our core business as evidenced by our 18% fixed FX growth this quarter and are well-positioned for the year ahead in the long-term.
As Larry says, although the vast majority of our resources in time continue to be invested in our core products, we also have enthusiasm to invest in new promising ideas like Self-Driving Cars or Loon. We use the same disciplined approach to these new areas that we used for investing in our earlier bets like Android or Chrome or Display.
Our projects start with small dedicated teams that are given clear milestones to hit before they can get further investments. And in cases where we achieve success against our milestones, we expand our investments, and you saw this as an example earlier this week with our Fiber teams. We greenlighted 18 cities in four metropolitan areas in the U.S., out of the 34 cities and 9 metros that we had reviewed in 2014, and they’re off to the races.
In other cases, when the teams aren’t able to hit hurdles, but we think there are still a lot of promise. We might ask them to take a pause and take the time to reset their strategies, as we recently did in the case of Glass. And in those situations our project don’t have the impact we had hoped for, we do take the tough calls. We make the decision to cancel them and you’ve seen us do this time and time again.
So before I turn it over to Omid, I’d like also to note that in many ways 2014 was a year of significant investment growth, both in CapEx and OpEx at Google. From an investment perspective, we’ll continue to seek a healthy balance between growth and discipline and the willingness to throw a little back when we reached the limits of what we believe we can manageably absorb. So with that in mind, I’ll take it over to Omid now to provide more specifics on the successful performance of our core and new businesses.
Omid is joining us by phone from another location today. So I hop it over to you, Omid.
Omid Kordestani
Thanks, Patrick. Hi, everyone, happy New Year. And thanks for joining us today. This is Omid. It’s my pleasure to join you from London tonight. I’m glad to be here to reflect on the last quarter and look ahead to 2015.
2014 ended with healthy momentum enabling us to achieve $66 billion in revenue for the year. In Q4, we launched Lollipop, our newest version of Android, refreshed our line of Nexus devices and introduced Inbox by Gmail, a new inbox that enables users to focus on the messages that matter most to them.
Meanwhile our sales teams worked diligently with our advertising partners to deliver a strong holiday season. Today, I’ll do a quick walkthrough of the business highlights from Q4. First, I’ll give an overview of the different sectors of our ads business, performance and brand advertising and our advertising platforms. Then I’ll cover progress in our emerging non-ads businesses.
Let’s begin with the performance advertising. We continue to evolve the foundation of Google’s advertising business to reflect a multi-screen constantly connected world. Mobile is now a behavior, not a device, and it has a variety of unique characteristics.
First, let’s talk about local advertising. On mobile, consumers want to know about the stores and goods near them. We launched some exciting updates last quarter. In October, we announced local availability for product listing ads and local store front, products that give customers real time information about goods that are in stock close to where they are.
Major retailers like Macy’s and REI took advantage of these local inventory ads during the holidays. Overall, we saw strong engagement and results from big-box retailers during the holiday season. A second priority has been the creation of new measurement tools. We recently added estimated store visits to our estimated total conversations measurement suite. Now, advertisers can see a reliable estimate of the number of times a search ad click drive the store visit.
During the holidays, ULTA Beauty reported that 12% of clicks on search ads led to a store visit with significant gains in ROI from their AdWords search marketing spend. These mobile-specific metrics help advertisers measure the full impact of their mobile marketing.
The third area of progress is apps. We have driven hundreds of millions of app downloads on Google Search, AdMob and YouTube. And this business continues to grow at a healthy clip.
During the holiday season, Office Depot used Google Search Ads to promote their ElfYourself app that helps shoppers create videos of people re-imagined as dancing elves. By using Google Search Ads they saw a 65% conversion rate. We have recently enabled users to more seamlessly navigate between apps and the web and find what they are looking for in apps more quickly.
In organic search 15% of signed-in users’ searches on Android now return deep links to apps. We also offer app deep linking in search ads. Booking.com uses Google Search Ads to drive installs and reengagement via deep linking for their mobile app.
Last quarter, we continued to see great traction with our established mobile advertising products as well, particularly Google Shopping. Online growth remains strong with Google Shopping traffic on mobile devices up nearly 100% compared to Q4 2013. For much of the holiday season mobile shopping clicks exceeded those on desktop as users increasingly made purchase decisions on the go.
Now, I would like to turn to YouTube, where we continue to deliver great results for brand advertisers. YouTube now has more than 1 billion users. Everyday people watch hundreds of millions of hours of video on YouTube, generating billions of views. Watch time is up 50% year-over-year. We continue to invest in our YouTube Partners and Partner revenue has increased by more than 50% year-over-year. We are seeing great momentum in mobile advertising on YouTube. Mobile revenue on YouTube is up more than 100% year-over-year.
TrueView, where advertisers pay only if someone watches their ad also continues to do very well. Walmart U.S.’s holiday performance is one of many success stories. During the week of Black Friday, they used YouTube’s TrueView format to drive a 300% week-over-week increase in views of their channel and more than 28 million views on the week.
This was a 600% increase in YouTube channel views over the same week in 2013. And while we are all anticipating a certain football game in Arizona this weekend, the action has already begun for its advertisers on YouTube. Nearly 70 ads or teasers related to the big game have been posted to YouTube this year, up 55% from the same time last year. People have been - people have already watched them more than 44 million times, up 25% from last year and for more than 70 million minutes on YouTube nearly tripled the watch time compared to the same point last year.
On average people watch each ad for more than a minute-and-a-half. We continue to develop the tools that make digital work for brand marketers, their agencies and premium publishers.
There were two particular areas of focus from Q4 that I would like to highlight, programmatic and measurement. Let’s start with programmatic. Automated ad buying has benefitted performance-driven advertisers for years. We’re now extremely well positioned as brand advertising shifts to programmatic as well.
We’re seeing great traction overall from our advertising and agency partners. Today, all the top 10 global agencies use at least one product in our double click suite. Specific products within the double click suite have shown exceptional momentum. DoubleClick Bid Manager, our primary frontend for programmatic buying has doubled in volume over the past year.
During the recent us mid-term election, programmatic represented nearly one-third of advertisers’ Google ad budgets.
We’re seeing that video, the ultimate brand medium, is starting to move to programmatic as well. After launching in June of 2014, Google Partner Select, our premium programmatic video marketplace now has more than 50 publisher partners including Hearst Television, and Food Network, and includes brands like BMW.
Next, we continue to invest in measurement tools that enable advertisers, agencies and publishers to better understand the results of their digital marketing. It starts with addressing the question of viewability. Nothing else matters if a human did not see your ad. This is the top question for the industry and at Google we are doing our part to address it.
Since July, we have been rolling out viewability report across our ad platforms, so that brands will know whether their video ads on digital channels were actually seen or not. We recently extended this activity reporting to video ads.
Large advertisers are finding technology like this to be very useful. For example, Kellogg’s used DoubleClick Digital Marketing to buy their inventory programmatically and increased their ad viewability by 70%.
Once a brand knows that their ads have been viewed they need to determine if the right people saw those ads and if they made an impact. That’s where our tools to measure brand lift come in. We have run more than 6000 brand lift surveys to help determine brand recall and purchase intent.
For example, Mondelez wanted to measure the effectiveness of a recent digital campaign for the launch of a gum brand. With brand lift they found a 36% lift in brand awareness versus a control group, and a 97% lift in ad recall versus a control group. Getting these types of feedback in real time is impossible with offline media. This sets digital apart.
Let’s move now to our emerging non-ad businesses. Google for Work had a great quarter. We started working with PwC to help them and a company they advise used Google for Work to move their businesses to the cloud. Cloud Platform continues to make good progress. We hosted our second Google Cloud Platform live event in November where we announced several new products such as Google Container Engine.
Our digital content businesses are strong. I’m excited about Google Play’s development. Movies are now available in more than the 102 countries, music in 58, and books in 65. It’s growing internationally at unprecedented speed. In December, we partnered with Sony to digitally release the interview. It has been publicly reported that the film generated over $15 million in its first weekend, and that Google Play and YouTube drove the majority of those sales.
We launched YouTube music key beta a monthly music subscription service that provides ad free music, background play, and offline viewing. This will also include a subscription to Google Play Music with more than 30 million songs, expert queue rated play lists, and more. Our hardware efforts demonstrate momentum just in time for the holidays we launched the Nexus 6, Nexus 9, and Nexus Player devices.
Chromecast continues to be a hit. Just last week, we saw our 1 billionth tap of the cast button. Chromecast usage per device has increased by 60% since launch due to a growing roster of new apps and features.
According to NPD Retail Tracking Service, in 2014, Chromecast was the number one selling streaming media device in the U.S. Chromebooks are now available in 33 different markets and enjoying strong success in K-12 education market in the U.S. I continue to be impressed by the work of our marketing teams that they’ve done around the world. The Year in Search has become an instant classic and YouTube Rewind is fast becoming one.
From the Android Be Together Not the Same Campaign to Nest’s first TV ads and much more our marketing team contributed to our success in the all-important Q4 to a wide variety of efforts.
That’s the wrap for 2014, and we are excited for what lies ahead in 2015. In closing, I want to thank our great partners, customers, and users, without them, we wouldn’t be successful. Thank you all so much.
Now, let’s get back to Patrick for Q&A.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Omid. Before we turn to Jamie for Q&A, I was highlighted by the team here that, I actually had a slip, I said Nexus 7 instead of Nexus 6. And although the Nexus 7 is still a great device, what I really meant in my comments was to talk about the Nexus 6, which is this amazing device that we have launched with the Lollipop launch.
So with that, I’ll turn it to Jamie, and we’ll go to Q&A. Jamie, if you can give the instructions please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.
Stephen Ju
Okay, thanks. So Patrick or Omid, I think, it’s been a few years since you talked to the Street about the run rate of your Display business. I wanted to see if you are willing to toss us a nugget here in terms of what your gross billings currently maybe, recognizing that you may be seeing growth in that revenue contribution depending on different products. And also it looks like the UK revenue saw modest bit of acceleration on an FX neutral basis, granted comps were probably modestly easier, but anything you can call out that would help there? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Yes, sure. It’s Patrick here. So on both topics, on the UK, we did see a good performance this quarter on UK versus last quarter, and as you said - mentioned, a 11% year-over-year. So the note of the UK is, the core business there is doing well. If you go back to last the deceleration, we have - it’s a big portion, it’s like 10% of our revenue, and we over 10%.
The - you will remember that in our mix of products that are in the UK, clearly, our core products are there, but also AFS, like the network business is actually prominent in UK, as well in the U.S. less so in the rest of the world. And so that has an issue on the mix. And then also think of it as a promising item, which is, there is areas of new products, such as Play that are actually stronger international than they would be in the UK or in the U.S. So there lies some of the differences between the growth rates, but in many ways a lot of opportunities there, so that’s what’s going on in the UK, quite pleased with the progress there in Q4.
And then on the issue of Display, we haven’t updated the numbers to the Street. And so we have to continue to, kind of, give you the updates that we do, and if we actually have a chance in the future then we’ll let you know when it’s time to do so. So thanks for your questions, Steven. And we’ll go to the next question, please. Jamie?
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner
Hi, thank you. Two questions, if I may, Patrick. You hired 2,000 people this quarter versus 1,700 in the same quarter last year, which is a 22% increase. But Google management talks a lot about the opportunity in front of the business. If that’s the case, why aren’t you hiring more people and spending more in R&D. Can you tell us what are the specific constraints that you guys have or imposed on yourselves that prevent you from hiring 3,000 people this quarter instead of 2,000? That’s the first one.
The second is the following, a few quarters ago, I seem to recall you saying that, you did not manage the business for margins, but you managed it for profit growth. Yet your operating income is down year-on-year and even if you are, the $200 million is growing very slowly. You could see how investors would look at that and say, well, how do you reconcile these things? How do you think investors should think about this trajectory of operating income growth? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Okay. So let’s take them in - each in step. On the issue of hiring, you will notice that relative to last quarter also, which is our third quarter is typically a big quarter, because we get the influx of the hires we do at colleges and otherwise. We actually decelerated from the third quarter as well. What we are managing for is, we just have a very high bar for hiring, if you can pass the bar, then we hire you. We also have capacity constraints on leadership, because there is a natural kind of number that you can kind of absorb within the culture of Google, it’s really important not to lose that culture and to have a velocity, to have traction.
So there is no sense bringing 5,000 people that we couldn’t kind of bring into the teams and really make them perform it. So what we manage on the hiring is, we have our plans, and so we have a rate of targets of hires per each of the pals and the areas of the company. And then from there, the next hurdle is really about, can we find these people?
And then finally, just making sure that we keep this kind of balance of bringing at a reasonable rate, so that we can actually absorb them in the company without losing the velocity and the culture of the place. So it’s actually a pretty complex puzzle, but we are managing it, it’s never perfect, but we are managing it, to the best we can. So that’s the first question.
On the issue of margins, look, we have different, if you think of the businesses in Google, we are looking for growth, we are looking for growth in revenue, we are looking for growth in operating profits absolute dollars, and we are looking for great returns on investment. That’s the puzzle we solve for.
So you have an advertising business that may have higher margins, lower capital intensity, than say, another business, which maybe Play, which has much lower margins, great prospect for growth with very large pools of revenue and margins available and we go after them for sure. You have Fiber right, and in the access, which is a completely different kind of capital intensity. But, again, the question is, does it promise, or does it have a case for large dollars operating profit delivery and high revenue and then a decent return on capital, that’s how we manage it.
And to kind of say, okay, well, we have what we have today, but if Play could grow at, just to take the case, ten times faster than it is doing right now, right, it would impact margin, because on the weighted average basis, it would drag it down, but we love it. We love to be able to grow Play ten times faster than we are today. So that’s how we think of the puzzle. We manage them each individually for their potential, their returns, we all look for these big margin pools and these big revenue pools, and then we just allocate our capital to make sure that it’s balanced across these initiatives for maximum velocity. That’s the way we think about it, Carlos.
Carlos Kirjner
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you very much for your question. Jamie, let’s go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.
Anthony DiClemente
Thanks a lot for the question. I have two. Patrick, given the importance of Google stock price as a motivator for existing employees, for recruitment of new employees. I think, many investors out there wonder if we are getting closer to a point where it might be a wise use of resources to return capital to shareholders. Other large tech companies do it, nearly all the media companies do, at what point would you and at what point would the board of Google consider capital returns?
And then second question is, I’m just wondering on the switch of the default browser on Mozilla from Google to Yahoo! in the quarter, and going forward is there any way you can quantify the impact of that? And the investors also wondering, is it possible that could happen for your Safari agreement with Apple? Thanks a lot.
Patrick Pichette
So, why don’t I take the last question first and then the first question. The last question is, you’ve all heard the announcements about Mozilla. And so when we don’t comment on the details of any of our partnerships that we have. Having said that, we continue to do two things that really matter. One is our users continue to actually go in, if they love Google, they will continue to find Google, whichever platform, whichever browser, and that’s really what we’ve focused on doing.
And then the second piece is the way to win this in the long-term, right, it’s very simple. You just make wonderful products. And when you make wonderful products that are magical people will find them.
And so that’s the strategy that we’re using and we just don’t comment on any of our - we’ve never commented on any of our deals, so we want comment on Mozilla either. And then, for your first question, Anthony, I mean, again I can’t - I just can reiterate the same message that I give on a regular basis, which is share price does matter. It matters to our board. It matters to all of us. We’re all shareholders in the company. And we do review this issue on a regular basis. We review it again responsibly with the Audit Committee, with the board. And I just have nothing to announce today.
Anthony DiClemente
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you so much for your question, Jamie. Let’s go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the questions. One on device mix, which, Omid, you called out. Is there any sense you can give us of whether some of the pricing per ad unit is starting to close from the device mix. So even though you’re giving more volumes from mobile whether be smartphone or tablet we’re starting to see any impact of pricing continues to move up versus desktop pricing you’re seeing across your ad portfolio, would love any commentary around that. And then second, Patrick, you called out the FX impact in the Q4, any help you can give us on how we should be thinking about the FX impact going forward on their a gross or a net basis to the business as you see it versus spot today? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Sure, I’ll let Omid answer the first question then I’ll jump on the second.
Omid Kordestani
Sure. Thanks, Eric for the question. The way we look at this, as I said, we look at mobile and as a behavior today really as - versus a specific device. And people are using screen interchangeably, simultaneously throughout the day. And we really think about the user and the context rather than a particular form factor or device. And similarly in terms of the pricing model here, what we are focused on really building this ecosystem just the way desktop took a long time to develop and have the right ad formats that really took advantage that the platform had to offer. We’re looking at this the same way.
We are developing different kinds of formats, working with marketers on mobile, estimated store visits, app install, app re-engagement ads and cross device conversions. And we really feel good about the traction we’re having and our sales team and advertiser agencies partners are working with us making rapid progress here.
So unfortunate, I can disclose any specific breakdowns, but I can just say that we are very focus on all aspects of this just as we evolve to desktop we’re doing the same in this world. On to you, Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. On the issue of FX, I think that the most important point to think about in Q4 is - I mean it was material. As I said, it was like on a gross basis over $600 million. You’ve all seen the deterioration of the euro, the GDP, the yen, I mean it’s versus the U.S. dollar. The one thing I would just note from our results in Q4, I mentioned this in the past that, our FX rates are set at Google a month in arrears. So in last week of November we would have set our FX rate for December. So interestingly, the December rates we’ll set January.
And you’ve seen already in December a continued kind of nose dive in certain areas, especially the euro, and the yen. So, all I can say is for all the information we have right now is, that’s not going away.
And I think that everybody should be kind of considering it. On the flipside of that, I just want to kind of reinforce the fact that our FX hedging program continues to do exactly what it’s supposed to do, which is in a low volatility environment we buy insurance. And in moments where we have such shocks like we’re having right now, we did get a lot of benefit out of this hedging program and just as a remainder we hedge profits, right? We don’t hedge revenue. It just happens that we book the profits to revenue, because of the accounting rules.
And so we’ve seen in Q4 approximately $150 million of hedge benefits, which is actually quite a substantial amount on the total $600 million and we’ll continue to have hedge benefits through the course of the year to a certain extent. So I think that from that perspective, right, real hit in December additional, but in a good position from our hedge FX program.
Eric Sheridan
Great. Thank you so much.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you for those questions. Jamie, why don’t we go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler
Great. I had two questions. Patrick, towards the end of the prepared remarks you said that Google show a balance of growth and discipline, and a willingness to throw a little back. Can you just elaborate on that comment? What do you mean when you say that? Are you referring to the pace of expense growth or throwing something back in terms of capital allocation, just a little clarity on that one?
And then, Omid, the question on app indexing, I think you guys said in November that log-in searches have about 15% coverage in terms of app content. Where is that percentage today and when do you guys think it will be closer to 100%? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Ross, let me - it’s Patrick, let me jump in on the first question then I’ll let Omid answer the second.
On the first one, all I wanted to highlight to our investors, shareholders and community at large is, as I said, 2014 was a year of significant investment growth. I mean, we see real potential in so many areas that are exciting to us and where we see great momentum. That - what I wanted to make sure is that, our investors continue to understand that we will push for growth, but in a disciplined manner. And if things don’t materialize in the way that you don’t hit your hurdles, you don’t hit your timing, right, we are actually disciplined to make sure that we don’t have expenses ahead of the curve and we continue to monitor it quite closely.
So in that sense if we see conditions change, it’s really important that you have the confidence that when we manage these investments we do it in the prudent manner, right, optimistic, but there’s always a dose of circumspection to make sure that you get the best bang for your buck in these roll-outs.
And that’s what I really want to kind of communicate and signal to the Street, which is, it’s a balance. It’s always about a balance but given our situation, given all of the results that we’ve had, I mean, 18% year-over-year growth, in our sites if you just look at the sites, which is the core of the business growing 18% year-over-year, despite all the FX headwinds, right?
It just tells you, look, this is a license to continue to invest smartly in the way we do, but I just want to kind of reaffirm to you that we do it in smart way and a discipline manner. We’re driving forward make sure we don’t waste our shareholders money.
So with that, I’ll turn it over to Omid to answer the first question, please.
Omid Kordestani
Yes. Thanks, Ross. So as I said in my opening remarks that 15% of signed-in users’ searches on Android now return deep links to app. The way we are focused on this is that we have opened up app indexing to all Android developers, so their apps can appear in searches, also linking directly to the right content in the apps. And it really becomes the job between the developers trying to understand intent and how obviously our research works and determining the best results to provide, including the deep links. We offer this deep linking and search ads as well. Booking.com use Google Search Ads to drive installs and reengagement via deep linking for their mobile approximately, and we are seeing more and more adoption like this by our advertisers.
So, obviously, it’s an area we are going to continue making progress on, we are very pleased to the traction we are having and how mobile monetization is performing. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question, Ross. Let’s go to our next question, Jamie, please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin Swinburne
Thank you. Patrick, just going back to return of capital again, there was– there’s some news today that there is a potential bill to allow repatriation of cash back to the U.S. at a 6% tax rate. I’m wondering, would that impact, how you and the board would think about return of capital, or is that sort of a completely relevant separate point?
And then second, for me - for either of you, any color you can share with us on your wireless ambitions, I think, both on the MVNO side and 3.5 gigahertz, there has been a lot of discussion in the press about what Google is up to, any update you can give us on that, would be great?
Patrick Pichette
So, on the second question, thank you for your questions, Ben. And on the second question that you’ve asked, right, there is a lot of speculation out there. And if we had to answer off every speculation on Google’s part, what’s going on, I mean, we just would be - my PR team would be really busy. So we just won’t comment on any speculative news.
On the first question, on return on capital, absolutely, I mean, we have right now a mix of, kind of, roughly 60-40 between our U.S. 40, international 60 of our cash. We have good use for our cash in both places. But if, in fact, we had a lot more flexibility about repatriating cash, that would make a big difference in the way that we think about it and or, at least, we’d take it in consideration for sure in our dialogue with the board. And so it’s clearly one element, that’s part of the puzzle that we would take in consideration. So if there is anything you can do to get that thing through Congress, Ben, we would really love it and just let us know when that happens.
Benjamin Swinburne
I will call my Congress person. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you so much. All right, Jamie, we are going to go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan.
Douglas Anmuth
Thanks for taking the question. You’ve had greater emphasis on e-commerce over the last few years with Google Shopping and Express. I was hoping you could give us an update on Google Wallet and how strategic that is to your business overall and kind of closing the loop payments in general.
And then secondly, can you comment, Patrick, on whether there is just anything in particular in driving the gap that we saw on sites between paid click volume and CPCs beyond some of the normal mix shift issues and FX? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
So why don’t I take the second question immediately, and then I’ll let, Omid, answer the issue of the commerce. So on the first one, look, it’s - I want to come back on the sites issue, because 25% and then the minus 8% in terms of click growth and CPSs. And I want to start with that, because that’s always the case when people kind of just focus on one, they - we kind of tend to forget the big picture, which is, it’s a mix of these two things that give you this revenue that’s been very strong in sites this quarter, so never look at them in isolation.
Having said that, as I said in my prepared remarks, the monetization metrics for sites has all the factors that I kind of usually discuss, which is geographic, device, property, the FX and all the things I talk about. So I think, it would be misguided again this quarter to pin it down to just one trend. I think people have a tendency to say, okay, well, it’s mobile, or it’s FX. And but I would like to point out three things specifically this quarter.
As we know as I already mentioned right, FX has been a big impact this quarter. I also noted the strength of mobile performance in our sites earlier. And I remind you that, our sites line also includes YouTube, where we continue to see impressive growth, both in developed countries and emerging markets.
So, there is the rest of it, there is all these pieces, but these are some of the pieces that we should take note during this quarter. Does that make sense? I will turn it over to Omid, to answer the first question on what’s going on with Google Shopping et cetera?
Omid Kordestani
Yes, on Shopping and commerce in general, then I’ll talk on payments, really our focus is building products that turn consumers’ shopping intents into actions, quickly, easily and enabling businesses to connect and retain these customers. On payments, the goal is really to remove all the friction that one encounters now in the shopping experience. And what we’re really working on here is, move beyond just tap and pay and have a full functional payment system.
Today, users can send to money to friends through Gmail using their wallet app and also just made this functionality available in the UK. Loyalty, gift cards can be stored on the Wallet app to buy with Google button makes it possible for users to purchase with two clicks. So we really are focused on building a rich offering here to make it easier to shop and pay and remove the friction. Thank you, Doug.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you so much for you question, Doug.
Douglas Anmuth
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Jamie, let’s go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post
All right. Thank you. I don’t know if you can help us at all, but just kind of overview of core search growth at all, if you can, in some of your mature markets anyway to breakdown that at all? And then as you think about the search improvements you’ve made, just a little high level overview, obviously, big changes with PLAs and enhanced campaigns over the last couple of years, didn’t seem like, there was a lot for this holiday, but maybe outline some of the improvements you’ve made recently? And then any - how is your pipeline looking for this year? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Omid, do you want to take that question?
Omid Kordestani
Yes, I’ll start and then we can add more context if you have more color you need, Justin. So in terms of product listing at PLAs, it’s very successful products and we are really pleased with its performance, advertisers are very pleased with it. And we also have local inventory apps that enable merchants to show customers this information in the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Japan, and Australia, and obviously we are going to continue to expand that.
As I said in my remarks, we added estimated store visits in December, and it’s been one year since we launched estimated total conversions. And just to give you some anecdotes with customers, PetSmart saw 10% to 18% of clicks on search Ads led to store visits and they’re now investing more in Ads to reach customers across multiple screens, Famous Footwear nationwide chain have 1,100 stores. They found that 15% to 17% of the clicks on Ads resulted in store visits, and they were able to mix up the products that they promote and there is in-store merchandising strategies by region.
So it’s - for us it’s early to think about the impact of revenue, but we really expect these suite of products to continue to help the advertisers measure at a full value of their online spending and work with us to enhance those. In terms of specific search numbers, we don’t really break that down, and provide any more data on that. Thank you for your question.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Justin. We’ll have - do we have time - couple of more questions, okay. So, Jamie, let’s go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney
Hey, thanks. I’ll echo Stephen Ju’s comment earlier, I think it would be great if you broke out that nonperformance advertising at some point in the future that data point would be very helpful. The CPC trends on sites that - they kind of inflected back down after showing a positive trend. It’s kind of hard to think that that’s nothing, but FX, I know, you have this mix of other factors, could you just clarify that, or could you quantify what CPC sites, CPSs would have been year-over-year ex-FX?
And then finally, Omid, could you just talk broadly about YouTube and you’ve come back you’re more engaged with the company, I think, there is bit of a change in management’s approach, I think, the YouTube and how you want to position it, I know it’s a broad question, but could you just talk about what you want to do differently with YouTube, going forward to the next few years? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So on the first question, why don’t I jump in and then I’ll let Omid talk about Q2. Look, as I mentioned just a minute ago, if you look at the sites CPCs, we purposefully actually don’t point to one item, like I think, it would be tempting to just say, okay, so it’s all FX this quarter, because geography has a big impact. As I mentioned right, the different properties on our sites, YouTube has an impact as well in the sense that’s it’s growing and it’s growing in emerging markets, as well as in its core more developed markets.
I purposefully made the case that’s important to note that, on the mobile side, I think, we see continued strength in mobile. And so from that perspective, it’s always trying to catch-up to the desktop, which itself as always improving, but we see positive trend there. So it is the mix of all these factors and we don’t give down all of the details on a quarter-by-quarter basis, because they just move all over the place. So that’s the answer for that one, Mark. Sorry, that’s not Mark. And then, I’ll let Omid answer the question on YouTube.
Omid Kordestani
Sure. So first of all, in general, just to give you sense of this, as you said, I’ve come back in, I just spent a lot of time CES, here in Europe spending time with customers as well. And there is just tremendous excitement about YouTube, and over 1 billion people come to the service every month and YouTube mobile revenue is up more than 100% year-to-year. And what we’re really after here is finding the click for brand, GRP brand list, other metrics, and advertisers are already running brand list studies about 6,000 of them have done this with that - already with us.
And what’s really unique about this service is the velocity that the creators enjoy to create and deliver content to a worldwide audience, and our investments in the service and the creators just continue to pay back for us. So I know based on my meetings, I spent a lot of time with consumer goods companies at CES with major agencies there. Everybody just wants to do more. There are a lot of success stories the way they engage with us. And for us the challenge frankly is to structure our sales organization, hire the right people to go deeper with these customers with our agencies. And so you’ll just see a lot of success and emphasis from us as we go after the branding dollars.
Mark Mahaney
Thank you, Omid. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you so much, Mark. Jamie, we’re going to take one more question, so if you can turn it on, please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Mark May with Citi.
Patrick Pichette
Mark, are you there?
Operator
And if you check your mute button, sir, we cannot hear you.
Mark May
Hello.
Patrick Pichette
There we are.
Mark May
Right, sorry about that. Two questions please. Could you tell us what your strategy is in the area of digital payments and is there way that you can leverage Android to develop differentiated product in the market.
And then, secondly, sorry, if I missed this. But how should we be thinking about the strategic and the financial importance of search partnerships like, for instance, the Safari deal. And if there is anything that we should be reading into the recent changes at Mozilla, and I think before that Spotlight and Siri search as far as either Google strategy and thinking in this area or its competitiveness in these deals? Thanks. Sorry, it’s a lot, but…
Patrick Pichette
That’s okay, Mark. No problem. So I’ll take the second question, and then I’ll flip it over to Omid to answer the Wallet one. So on the issue of partnerships, Google has a lot of partnerships, right, it’s got - it’s an anchor of our strategy, because that actually gives us distribution, distribution is good. And so we also we look for partnerships in many spaces.
Partnerships have to be win-wins, and in that sense, right, we’ll always look for those combinations. But also at the end of the day, there’s a second piece of the strategy, which is, as I said earlier, building amazing product, because if you build the amazing products then people want to distribute you product.
And so that’s why, we have a meet in the whole search team that actually do this amazing job through the knowledge graph and all of the other elements of search, and no matter what the device, no matter the location, no matter the time of day. If we give you the answer as you’re looking for and 10 clicks less than it was before and then even faster and better all the time, that’s what wins, and that’s the core of what we’re focused on, and then people will find the way to get the Google.
So, yes, partnerships matter. But at the core of it, you need partnership, because you have a phenomenal product. And that’s what we’re going to continue to build this amazing company. So I’ll let with that Omid talk about our developments for digital payments.
Omid Kordestani
Hi, Mark, I already addressed this a little earlier, but - so I’ll summarize it again. But we’re really after removing the friction here in all the products to improve commerce and make the experience for our users seamless here. And there’s really two areas we’re focused on; one is really building a full functional payment system that just is beyond tap and pay. So I mentioned that earlier using Gmail and the Wallet App to send money to friends, loyalty and gift cards and buying with Google button with a press of two clicks.
So and we just - the NFC devices are available, and we are really getting closer and closer to broader merchandise option. And so you’ll see us emphasizing that through the devices that we are supporting out there, as well as the payment services and commerce services that we provide. So I think, you will see a lot of progress here as we - as I said try to remove the friction here.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you so much for your question, Mark. Omid, I need to thank you. I mean, you’re at the other end of the world and staying late for us, I think, I just can’t thank you enough for all of your support over…
Omid Kordestani
It’s my pleasure. We’re excited about the year ahead and looking forward to future updates with this group of people. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
For all of you thank you again for your support in 2014. Welcome to 2015, and I couldn’t stop without thanking again all of our partners, our users, and lastly, our employees, all Googlers around the world that make this magic happen every day, couldn’t do it without you, so thank you again. And Jamie, I’ll let you close the call on this.

Good day and welcome everyone to the Google Inc.'s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Ellen West, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ellen West
Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Patrick Pichette and Omid Kordestani.
As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations page for the latest Company news and updates. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected [Audio Gap] this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and, as applicable, other special items. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Ellen. As some of you may know, we have a new leader in our Investor Relations team at Google. Her name is Ellen West. That’s the great voice you just heard a minute ago, a second ago. Ellen is a long term Googler who joined us in 2007. Although she is here with us today in Mountain View, she is actually based out of New York and that will give us a bit more footprint on the East Coast as well. So, Ellen, welcome to the team.
With that, let’s dive into the details of Google’s financial performance for Q3. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 20% year-over-year to $16.5 billion and was up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would have been 19% year-over-year. Google sites revenue was also up 20% year-over-year to $11.3 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter driven by the strength in our mobile search.
Network revenue was up 9% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was flat quarter-over-quarter driven by improved year-over-year growth in the AdMob and the Ad Exchange businesses. Finally, Google’s other revenue grew a healthy 50% year-over-year to $1.8 billion and was up 15% quarter-over-quarter, this driven by year-over-year growth mainly from the Play Store but also complemented by an increase in licensing revenue.
Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 17% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPCs were down only 2% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. And without currency fluctuations, aggregate cost per click would have been down 1%, and in fact, up 1% quarter-over-quarter.
As we began to do in our last earnings call, we continue to disclose paid clicks and cost per click changes by property type as well in addition to the aggregate number. So to that end, Google sites paid clicks were up 24% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Google sites CPC were down 4% year-over-year and down 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our network paid clicks were up 2% year-over-year and down 4% quarter-over-quarter and network CPCs were down 4% year-over-year but up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors including geographic mix, device mix, property mix as well as ongoing products and policy changes.
Turning to geographic performance now, we saw solid performance in the U.S. as well as in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you will see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., UK and the rest of the world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. U.S. revenue was up 15% year-on-year to $7 billion. The UK was up 17% year-over-year to 1.6 billion and in fixed FX terms, the UK grew 10% year-over-year. In the UK, growth was impacted by a combination of factors this quarter including platform and property mix as well as tough comps from year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth rates for a number of reasons including for example weather. Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the UK was up 26% year-over-year to $7.9 billion. This accounted for 48% of total revenue which includes a 10 million benefit from our hedging program. In fixed FX terms in fact the rest of the world also grew 26% year-over-year, very healthy.
Let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was 2.8 billion in Q3 which excludes stock-based compensation and also a non-cash impairment charge of 378 million related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired as part of our Motorola Mobility purchase. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled 5 billion, again excluding SBC. And as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit [Audio Gap] and our non-GAAP operating margin were 32% in Q3.
Headcount was up roughly 3,000 in Q3. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 55,000 full time employees. And please note that the headcount does include still approximately 3,500 full time employees from the Motorola business. In the past year, we continued to attract and hire the best talent from the best colleges and universities from all around the world. Continuing our past trend, graduate starts are much more heavily concentrated in Q3, which is part of why you are seeing the significant bump in headcount with the majority being tech hires, I want to kind of emphasize.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% for Q3 and which includes the impact of the impairment charge that I mentioned earlier which is a non-deductible for income tax purposes.
Let me turn now to cash management. OI&E or other income and expenses was $133 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. And for more details on OI&E, please do refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was 2.4 billion. In this quarter the majority of the CapEx was related to our data center construction, production equipment and real estate purchases, in that order. It's important to remember that our infrastructure supports all of our products, whether they are core products like or Search or Ads, Maps or YouTube, but in addition to fueling our growth products like Photos and Hangouts, Google For Work and the Cloud platform. If you look at our data center announcements over the last four quarters, you will also see that we've been really busy with both groundbreakings and expansion all around the world including Finland, Taiwan, Singapore, recently announced Netherlands in addition to our ongoing investments in the U.S. In total, our free cash flow was then 3.6 billion.
And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. The team continues to work hard and we look forward to seeing them join the Lenovo team soon. Motorola had a great Q3, with strong user reviews for products like the Moto X, Moto 360 and Moto Hint, clearly demonstrating the impressive momentum of the company.
So there you have it. Strong results with continued strong growth in both revenue and profits and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities including the usual Android, Chromes and YouTube but also Google For Work and Cloud to name a few.
Before I hand things over to Omid, I'd like to share with you some great news. I am really thrilled to announce that Omid is now officially Google's Chief Business Officer and this on a permanent basis. All of us at Google couldn't be happier to see Omid at his post running our business organization once again. And with that, I will turn it over to him for more details on our performance in the quarter. And after his remarks as usual, we will have Jamie open up the lines for your questions. Here you go, Omid.
Omid Kordestani
Thank you very much, Patrick. And hello, everyone. I am Omid Kordestani. I am happy to be back at my new old job and thank you for joining us this afternoon. I joined Google back in 1999 to help get our business off the ground and led our business operations until 2009. Since then I have served as an advisor for Larry and outside Google actively helped many entrepreneurs. I am thrilled to be back at Google leading our global business again.
We continue to have the same boundless energy and endless curiosity we've always had as a company and we are as focused as ever in our mission of making information useful and accessible to everyone. Case in point, we are really excited about this week's Android Lollipop launch. This is our largest release on Android ever with over 5,000 APIs for developers. It adds new features including better notifications, battery life and security and introduces a refreshed, consistent visual style. And alongside the new devices Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player, consumers in India who bought the recently announced Android One will get the update to the latest software at the same time.
Now I’ll do a quick walk through of the business highlights from Q3. As usual, we’ll give an overview of these four areas, performance and brand advertising, our advertising platforms and our emerging non-ads businesses. Let’s start with performance advertising, the core of our business.
People want the right information at the right time. They don’t want to have to think about whether it’s on the web or in an app. We’ve learned this first hand as a developer of many services, Maps, YouTube, Gmail that also are some of the world’s most popular mobile apps. With that in mind, we have a simple goal with performance ads: help marketers connect with customers at the right moment to drive measurable results.
Our partners have driven hundreds of millions of app downloads with AdMob on our click to download formats. But most mobile apps are downloaded, used once and eventually deleted. So we launched new features to help advertisers re-engage with users post download. For example, advertisers can now deep link from their search ads directly into their mobile apps. To succeed with multi-screen marketing, advertisers also need modern measurement tools so they can understand when their ads drive phone calls from customers resulting conversions on other devices or lead to store visits and purchases. Last October we announced estimated total conversions, our effort to help marketers better measure the value of their multi-screen advertising. We’ve worked to continue developing this product and launched cost device measurement for display ads. Clients have already found that mobile display campaigns drive 15% more conversions than they had previously measured.
Let’s shift gears to talk about our shopping efforts. [Audio Gap] with performance ads we are directly connecting people with [Audio Gap] and then enabling them to buy and have them delivered. We keep making improvements to our products to help retailers. Keeping inventory organized and up to date is a constant challenge for retailers. We help them manage this issue by completing the transition of product listing ads to our shopping campaigns platform.
And finally, people often want to find stores near them to make a purchase in person. We’ve long had local inventory ads that enabled merchants to show customers this information in the U.S. and we launched these in the UK, France, Germany, Japan and Australia last quarter. In summary, the core of our business, performance advertising, continues to deliver great results.
Let’s move on now to our brand business. Our objective is clear here, make digital the best possible canvas for creative and effective brand-building campaigns. First let’s talk about YouTube. Any conversation about great advertising starts with great content. On YouTube, stars produce amazing content that our users love from Bethany Mota to Smosh to Mental Floss. Earlier this year we launched Google Preferred to help connect brands with premium ad inventory on our most popular YouTube channels. Since then we have secured upfront commitments from top media agencies. We’re just getting started with YouTube and its potential. We’ve sold out the majority of our U.S. Google Preferred offering which represents among the top 5% of popular channels inventory on YouTube. And as a result of terrific brand events in Germany, France, UK and Australia, we’re seeing tremendous interest from local agency partners around the world.
Last quarter we also saw some great progress in our brand efforts beyond YouTube. We launched new ad formats customized for mobile screens. We also announced an expansion of YouTube’s TrueView ads into AdMob's network of more than 650,000 mobile apps. Everyday our teams work to develop both the products and terrific partner relationships that enable us to tackle any digital marketing challenge across multiple channels together. With encouragement from Google and YouTube, ABC executed a digital first marketing plan for their new fall TV line up. Their effort included custom five second-ads for TrueView and collaborations with homegrown YouTube stars. We’re very excited about the new deal with Mondelez and Starcom MediaVest. This global agreement will focus on video and display and is Mondelez’s largest digital media deal ever.
Next let’s take a look at one of the fastest growing parts of digital advertising world, programmatic platforms for agencies and publishers. For many years now our goal has been to provide world class technology for brands, agencies and publishers who power their ads businesses. Today our DoubleClick suite is used by all major agencies and we’re particularly focused on multi-screen and video. DoubleClick Bid Manager is the go-to tool for marketers and agencies to navigate the rapidly growing programmatic advertising space. It’s doubled in size year-over-year by impression volume and we really love the progress we see here. For publishers, we help them make money from their content via our publisher tools from our Ads Exchange to customized private exchanges which complement our core offerings. This quarter we signed new private advertising exchange deals with publishers like Fox TV and Edmunds. This helps publishers generate revenue from premium ad space. We have nearly doubled the number of private [Audio Gap] our system year-over-year.
Finally, we’re seeing remarkable momentum in our newer non-ads businesses, whether it’s Play, Hardware or Google For Work, we continue to see strong growth and we’re thrilled to be a platform for our partners' successes as well. Google Play’s growth continues to impress. It’s a linchpin of the amazing Android ecosystem. We brought Play Music to 17 new countries, bringing the total to 45 and our expansion continues. Today, Play Movies is available in 93 countries and Play Books is available in 61 countries.
On the hardware front, just yesterday, we unveiled three fantastic new Nexus devices, Nexus 6 phone, Nexus 9 tablet and Nexus [Audio Gap] and Android powered streaming media player. This quarter we worked with HP, Toshiba and Acer to introduce five new Chromebook devices and teamed up with Asus, LG, Motorola, Samsung and Sony to help launch new Android Wear devices. We’re also selling Chromebook in six new countries. They’re now available in 31 countries around the world. And we sold more than 1 million Chromebooks for education this quarter, even more than last quarter.
Chromecast celebrated its first birthday this past quarter. It’s been a smashing success. Users have hit the cast button more than 400 million times since it launched to enjoy their favorite sports, music, premium movies and TV shows. In September, we added even more content to Chromecast, including Disney content. And we were so proud to launch Android One, an effort to make high quality low cost smartphones available to as many people as possible. We started in India and we’ll be expanding to other countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines in the coming months.
For businesses, what was called Google Enterprise, is now simply Google for Work. This business has great traction. In addition to the tremendous growth in our Apps business, we have more than 1,800 signups for Google Drive for Work every week. Plus there are almost 250 billion active Google Drive users, including consumer, education and business users.
We continue to invest in our growing Cloud platform business, helping developers realize the promise of cloud computing by providing affordable on-demand access to world-class technology. We recently announced Google Cloud Platform for Startups and offer up to $100,000 in credits to enable the best and brightest startups to use Google’s Cloud platform.
Sony Music recently built an interactive app in less than three weeks using App Engine to engage fans tuning into One Direction Day, an eight-hour YouTube livestream featuring the band, one of the largest ever YouTube music live streams.
Lastly, our marketing team had a great quarter as well. Google My Business helped more small businesses get online. And our Art, Copy & Code project showed advertisers the creative potential of digital marketing. And from the annual Google Science Fair to more recent campaigns showcasing amazing content on Play, YouTube stars and the power of the Google App, the magic of Google was on prominent display.
All told, it was another terrific quarter at Google, continued momentum in our core business and exciting innovation in new areas. Kudos to the Googlers around the world who made it all happen.
I’ll turn it over to Patrick to wrap up and start our Q&A.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Omid. So Jamie, if you want to give us the instructions then we’ll get going on the Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric Sheridan - UBS
Thanks for taking the questions. So, first one, maybe with the announcement that you’re expanding Google Shopping Express into other cities and rebranding it and new retailers are coming on, [Audio Gap] what you saw on those first few cities to think about extending it further into the other cities. And what you might be hearing from feedback from retailers about adopting the platform because a few also dropped off the platform at the same time? Just wanted to get a little bit better color about how that was developing and how you were going to go forward with it. Thanks.
Omid Kordestani
Thank you very much, Eric. So, we're really trying to learn a lot here. Innovation is a messy process and especially with Google Express here. There is a lot of understanding that we need to have on improving efficiency in the logistics process, trying to find price points that shoppers find attractive. And our goal is really to help the over 35 merchant partners succeed and reach their customers. And I'm a user of it and I am really impressed by how much time it saves. I see the cars running around the city around me. And I think our goal is really to take it a step at a time and see the success, understand the logistical operations, how much it costs us to do this and can we deliver this basically in a successful way.
Patrick Pichette
Just Eric, just a couple of kind of additional points; one is, clearly we’ve announced this week three other cities. So if you go back to the fundamental premise of [Audio Gap] which is the first thing was would people show up and want this product. It’s very clear people want this product. The second one was -- and that’s why we’re expanding the product.
The second question then is, we've had a lot of questions about monetization, and we've announced this week we're taking real actions on the monetization service, both including commissions on each transaction from merchants, but also service fees that were announced as well. So from that perspective, we kind of think of it as now we're in Phase II of this product where according to our business plan we continue to kind of look for the barriers, the milestones, and then when we hit those milestones, we with enthusiasm keep on going. All this to say, it is nevertheless a scale business, so working on efficiencies, working on all of the issues that are related to logistics continues to be a big focus of ours.
And on the partners, I mean we're really thrilled to have the partners we have. You can expect as we kind of grow through this that we have a few coming in, a few coming out, but overall very, very pleased with the trajectory there. And so I think you should see the announcements of this week as this kind of sign of optimism and momentum in it.
Thank you so much for your question, Eric.
Eric Sheridan - UBS
Great.
Patrick Pichette
Jamie, let's go to our next question.
Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. I'm wondering if you can help us at all segregate the search business from other items in Google website and just give us your view on the health of the search business. And then comment a little bit on the paid click deceleration, what's driving that? And do you even see that as an important metric? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So I'll take that. The two points is, one, look, we don't give the breakdown of the Google sites, but actually it's pretty healthy on all dimensions. I think that from that perspective, search is going well. And all of the other dimensions of our sites have actually doing pretty well, and that's what you see in our kind of 20% year-over-year just for sites growth. So from that perspective, I think that we're pretty happy on that front.
On the CPC issue, it's pretty simple. I mean we really had -- again, you have to think of the CPC and the volume as one basket that actually delivers. So monetization overall is still very strong. We're very happy with the monetization, Jamie. And if we have in one quarter kind of movements between one and the other, that's just basically the continued experimentation and the impact of all the factors that I usually talk about.
So from that perspective, there was nothing noteworthy to kind of mention this quarter. We're very happy with the trends in both cases.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Jamie. Jamie, we'll go to our next question. Sorry, Justin, I meant. Jamie, we'll go to our next question.
Operator
And we'll go next to [Stephen Zhu] (ph) with Credit Suisse.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey, thanks. So I think in the past you've talked about the opportunity cost of not being there for the user when they're trying to access your products and services as a rationale for making investments. So is there any data you can share on your newest users in the emerging markets who are going straight to mobile? Is it safe to assume that consumption from these new users are running at a pretty similar growth trajectory with what you've seen historically on a desktop and as well as your established markets? Or is their engagement with all of your products more intense?
And is there anything you can say in terms of what areas of your business are seeing the more intense level of investments? Is it more your consumer-focused initiatives or more your enterprise-focused cloud initiatives? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So a couple points there, and then if Omid has additional comments. One is clearly emerging businesses -- emerging markets are just fundamentally different than the more developed markets, if you think of a country like Indonesia or India where people go straight to mobile. And so in that context, there's clearly a lot of differences between those markets and how they're evolving compared to what would have been 10 years ago the UK or the U.S. So from that perspective, I think that -- and that's why you see us launch things like Android One, right? When you have 1 billion -- just under 2 billion people around the world that have already smartphones, the vast majority of the population looks for things online. So these kind of initiatives that we're launching is the most important piece.
From an investment at Google, we're investing -- without giving you all the details, we're clearly investing in our core business. It remains the focus of our activities. But if you look across -- as Omid mentioned, he mentioned the Cloud business, the Google For Work business, all of these other areas, the Play business, the Hardware business, these are all areas where we're investing and we're investing with enthusiasm with each their own specific business case, each of them are actually looking for what is their growth and profitability models and we just monitor them pretty tightly.
Okay, so you're welcome. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Hey, Patrick, in describing the Google search strength, you said you saw particular strength in mobile search. Could you elaborate?
Patrick Pichette
Yeah. I mean, look, it's very clear that mobile is still a big part of our growth. And we're very pleased about it. I mean, it's -- but when we talk about mobile, I think there's a couple things. One is you have to continue to look at both the growth in volume and the growth in pricing. So these are long-term trends that we're seeing. The CPCs and the clicks, they can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. It just happens that we've made some changes this quarter that improved the mobile pricing while impacting the lower quality clicks and that's what you see a bit reflected in our numbers.
And again, and I wouldn't -- just as an overall statement, remember to everybody that I wouldn't attribute the aggregate CPC movement [Audio Gap] mobile, because there's still a full factor mix that -- as I talked in my remarks about geography and about our product changes. And so all this actually makes a big factor as well. So that's what we've seen in the strength in mobile, but we're still very pleased with the momentum.
Thanks, Mark. Jamie, we'll go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Thanks, guys. I just had two questions, first on the UK and then second on mobile payments. So the UK growth, looks like it's dropping off pretty hard on an ex-FX basis, either one-year or two-year growth rates. So I think this is an economy that folks generally think is supposed to be holding up pretty well. So can you talk about what you're seeing in the UK? You had mentioned weather and a few other things, but a little bit more color on what's going on with the ad market in the UK.
And then mobile payments, that's an area that's getting a lot of attention lately. Can you just give us an update on where the Google Wallet team stands and what kind of traction you're seeing in terms of user adoption and maybe how you plan on addressing merchant payments kind of outside of in-app or things from the app store? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So, Ross, why don't I take the first question and then Omid will give you the answer on the second?
As we talk about the UK, a couple points are worth note. One is, the UK contributed roughly 10% of our total revenue this quarter, and that's been the same for kind of the past many quarters. And in fact, if you go back years, it will still be in the same range. So there's nothing kind of fundamental that -- it's worth noting that it's still a pretty good market with decent growth.
The issue of deceleration this quarter specifically, on platform -- I mean I mentioned a number of elements, right? So platform mix, we do see [Audio Gap] of desktop, tablet searches having a greater impact in UK than anywhere else that we see in our network of countries. On property mix, remember we talked about this also on prior calls. AFS as a business has much bigger part of our both UK and U.S. business, so it will skew to those geographies. And so those are kind of some of the elements.
And as I mentioned, year-over-year comps were difficult. And then if you have a great summer in terms of weather or bad summer in weather, it can have some real impact on the growth rates as well. So it's a combination of a number of factors that the UK has driven our performance, but still pretty pleased. But I won't -- that's really what's going on there.
In terms of the payments, I'll let Omid give you an update there.
Omid Kordestani
Hi, Ross. I think our goal here is really achieving mass merchant adoption, so the availability of these NFC devices is about that and also making it easier for consumers to replace their wallets with their smartphones hopefully more and more over time. So reducing friction in everyday shopping experiences is how we approach it and the focus on the user and we're really developing a fully functional payment system.
So, as you may know, users can send money today to friends through Gmail using the Wallet app. We have loyalty and gift cards that can be stored in the Wallet app. The Buy with Google button makes it possible for users to make purchases very quickly with two clicks. So, again, it's this two-fronted focus on merchant adoption and removing the friction for users.
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Ross. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
Omid, after many years of waiting for television budgets to shift online, it appears to be happening in a more accelerated fashion. So, one, do you agree with that? And two, could you just discuss YouTube's positioning versus competitors and in particular Facebook Video?
And then Patrick, a couple of quick ones for you. One, given the evolution of tax laws in Europe, how are you and how should we be thinking about Google's tax rate over the coming years? And then also just any comments on stock comp being particularly high this quarter? Thanks.
Omid Kordestani
Thank you, Ben. This is Omid. So the way we look at it is that users are really accessing Internet on large screens with high broadband speeds, and we're getting great monetization on these screens and advertisers are really paying attention. So we have seen a real shift where marketers and agencies who have historically built their brands on TV are really reorienting this toward investments on digital.
And as in regards to YouTube, our focus here is really this focus on investments and more content, more creativity. And I think you also mentioned that you had a Facebook comment. What they are doing I think in video has always helped us with bringing more attention and more innovation to the space, so we welcome that. And the way we're going to approach it is just continue to investing in our platform and on the creators and building better and better monetization solutions.
Just again, you may know some of these metrics, but I'll say it again that we have 400 hours of content that are uploaded every minute and partner revenue is up 60% from 2012 to 2013 on YouTube.
Patrick Pichette
Great. Let me jump, Ben, on the -- your two specific questions. [Audio Gap] tax issues, you've heard about the Ireland announcement earlier this week on the double Irish tax structure. I mean, for us, we've always said that it's for politicians to decide what laws they want to put and then for companies just to comply with those laws. And that's what we're basically doing. So we're deeply committed to Ireland. We've worked there for many years. We have a great -- that's our headquarters. We have over 2,500 employees there. And so from that perspective we're committed to the place. And we're going to work with the authorities just to kind of get clarifications over this. But it's really way too early to tell what's going to happen. So we're, just like you, getting the information, the news, and we're going to work with the authorities to understand it better and then comply with the laws.
In terms of stock-based compensation, just a few notes on this one for this quarter. We have -- it's the time of year where we do equity refresh. And from a timing perspective last year, we did the equity refresh in Q2 instead of Q3. So there's kind of like a geography of Q2 versus Q3 that kind of hit us in Q3. In addition to this, if you go to our filings, you'll see that our executive compensation -- so think of the top 15 or top 20, I can't remember the exact numbers, but it's stated there – that they do their refreshes every two years and it happens to be this quarter as well. And then finally, I mean, we obviously have more employees. So it's just a compounding set of factors, Ben, that I kind of lumped it all into Q3. So it's no more, no less than that on that -- on that one.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura
Thanks a lot. Just on core operating expenses, is there anything [Audio Gap] Patrick that you might call out in terms of expense growth in the quarter as you have operating deleverage through the P&L? Just wondering, going forward, if that's likely to continue.
And then a question for Omid I suppose on YouTube. You mentioned -- I know that YouTube's investing in its studio as a way to help along new talent, new homegrown talent onto the platform directly. I'm wondering if you can talk about the multichannel networks, how YouTube's relationships with the multichannel networks, the MCNs, are evolving at a high level? How you guys think about that dynamic between the homegrown YouTube talent itself as compared to talent that resides on the MCNs? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Okay. Anthony, thank you for your question. Why don't I jump in right now on just expenses for the quarter? I think if I had two comments to make on expenses in the quarter, you may notice that relative to a few models that I saw out there, R&D was higher and other areas are a bit lower. And I just want to highlight that we hire and we focus clearly our hiring in our tech payroll, or think of it as all of our engineering. And that skews to R&D. So as we bring on people and we push forward the growth of our -- we really focus it in the areas that are going to make a fundamental difference to Google, which is engineering, and by doing so, it kind of skews to R&D. So that's why R&D may be a bit higher than expected by some models out there. And so that's one piece.
And then the other one is just wanted to reiterate that it's very clearly an extraordinary quarter from a hiring perspective for the comments I've made before. And so we're kind of clearly seeing that. But at the same time I wouldn't say that this is clearly a new run rate for us or anything like that. It just happened that most of these college students end up landing in Q3 and we have the result of a banner year from a hiring perspective all through. It takes a year to hire them all and then they come into this quarter. So that's really kind of the two big elements that have actually flowed, Anthony, through our P&L this quarter.
I'll let Omid answer the YouTube question.
Omid Kordestani
Yes. Anthony, so, again, we have a very, very partnership minded organization here and company as a whole. So we view MCNs as -- or organizations that are really going to help develop a great content, support the creators on YouTube. Just like we are doing that with YouTube Studios, I think MCNs can help a lot of these become future stars hopefully and develop more success. So just we view it as another form of partnership that we need to pay attention to and support. So that's how we look at it.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Anthony. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you. I have two questions. Patrick, is CapEx still driven by real estate and construction? And if yes, can you explain in a bit more detail what changed about 18 months ago in the way you acquired real estate and build to drive the inflection in capital intensity that we have seen? It looks like you operated for more than 10 years in one way and then there was a shift that has led to this massive inflection. So what happened there?
Secondly, do you think that Google login is adopted or inspired to being adopted by a large enough number of important mobile apps for you to be competitive in the long term when it comes to offering mobile [Audio Gap] and can you give us an update on the developer adoption of deep linking? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So I can certainly take the first and let Omid answer the second. I've made that comment before in a prior quarter, Carlos. The CapEx intensity and our CapEx program has been built by a combination of, as I mentioned in previous quarter, catching up when we were running too hot in terms of tightening of capacity. And so -- and once I'm very happy that when we really torque our utilization rates, on the other side it creates a lot of operational issues. And that led us to believe that in fact investing ahead of the curve was actually a strategic imperative for us to make sure that if we have the extra capacity, we will grow into it.
And I think the difference between -- certainly on the data center side, data center construction and machines, and you'll have noticed that this quarter again, there are priorities. If you look at the nomenclature I gave, construction of data center is the primary. So it is the core infrastructure, it's groundbreaking and it is setting up the core infrastructures. Machine was the second one for this quarter, but you'll notice that it flip flops real estate. In the case of the real estate, we have been investing for our campus and otherwise when we see -- when we hit kind of minimum scale, we need to kind of make investments in real estate. And again with an eye of looking for the long term, rather than just filling at least for the next 12 months or 24 months, because once you kind of -- if you decide you're going to grow in a place, then you need the capacity for multi-years. So all of these factors have actually kind of been the driver for the shift in capital intensity that you've seen over the last 18 months. So that's basically the explanation, Carlos.
I'll let Omid kind of jump on the second question about the mobile question.
Omid Kordestani
Sure. Thanks, Carlos. So the AdMob network reaches 900 million unique devices per month and our own apps are hugely popular, Gmail, Maps, Google App and YouTube. And our focus is also -- is helping developers generate app downloads and re-engagement with users who have already downloaded their apps, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier. And we're really helping drive hundreds of millions of app downloads through app promotion products.
Again, the goal here is that you just search and not worry about where the answer is either on a webpage or on an app. And we've been in this game for a while. Four years ago, we acquired AdMob and have continued to invest in this space heavily. And this quarter, we launched the next generation of these promotion ads across Google search, Google Display Network, and YouTube. So we're really focused on this area to help the developers and our users.
Patrick Pichette
I think we can clearly say that we're pretty pleased with the developer adoption of this. They see a huge benefit, so they're actually investing in it.
Thank you, Carlos.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Thanks for taking the question. Just two for Omid. First, you talked about estimated conversions and seeing a 15% increase there. Can you just talk about whether you think that's actually leading to more spend at this point from advertisers? And then, secondly, are you seeing mobile like-for-like pricing improvements at this point? And what gives you the confidence in mobile closing the gap with desktop over time?
Omid Kordestani
Thanks, Douglas. Both are really good questions that are related really. I think the way this is going to play out is that I think advertisers are going to, with these tools, be able to just understand conversions better -- where is it happening? And then the dynamics of how those changes is all the way back to adjusting bids and then paying attention to where the conversions are coming from.
So, again, I think just to maybe highlight some examples for you, we have a fashion retailer Express who's an early tester, found that the overall return on their ad spend doubled when offline sales were included in their online advertising results. So we're just continuing to invest here and get this right. It's too early to figure out the impact exactly on revenue, but we expect the estimated total conversions to help the advertisers fully measure this and ultimately adjust their bidding and just get much more sophisticated in these measurements. I hope that answers.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
And mobile on a like-for-like basis?
Omid Kordestani
The way we're focusing this is that users really are using their screens interchangeably simultaneously throughout the day and that we really are not at this point doing this like-by-like comparisons or comment on it because we think it's still early and we're really focused on just again delivering the results. And it took many years, for example, for the desktop ecosystem to develop the right ad formats and really take advantage of the platform. So I think we just need to continue innovating here, experimenting here to get it right.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Douglas. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark May with Citi.
Mark May - Citi
Thanks for taking my question. One on -- there's been quite a bit of attention paid to cloud services space and Google in particular. Wondering if you can comment a little bit around the traction that you're getting with the Compute Engine? And what sort of impact that that's having on revenue or expenses and CapEx for the business?
And then secondly, I think earlier you made a comment around some changes you've made in mobile that have impacted some of your network click metrics, so hoping you could elaborate a bit more on that.
Patrick Pichette
Okay. Do you want me to...
Omid Kordestani
Go ahead.
Patrick Pichette
I'll just jump on the cloud and then the last piece and then maybe -- I wasn't sure what the very first part of your question, Mark, was. But clearly, cloud is an area that is kind of booming, right? We know that the long-term trends are very clear for us, which is the vast majority of businesses. Everybody is moving their infrastructures to the cloud. So -- and it is an area where we have fundamentally great assets to contribute to this industry, both in terms of the flexibility, the cost structure, the technology, and that's why we're investing heavily in there. We're seeing great progress from an adoption perspective, signing up new customers.
And from a CapEx, obviously you need to kind of -- that's one of them that as I mentioned on the CapEx story with Carlos a few minutes ago, if you do take off and you really get the kind of customer adoption that you expect, if you don't have the capacity in place, it can have a really important kind of differential in your success. So there is one that we're keeping a pretty close eye on from a CapEx perspective in making sure that we have the option value.
The third question was mobile that have network clicks. So, yeah, I mean, clicks and CPCs always fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. It just happens that we've made some -- as I mentioned, made some changes this quarter that improved our mobile pricing while impacting low quality clicks. So sometimes, it goes -- if you think of a long-term trend in the mobile sector piece of our product, sometimes you kind of put a new change in the network and it creates a lot of clicks for it, but then the CPCs are much lower. And then if it doesn't actually create something that's really good for the user, you need to kind of pull back on it, and that's what you've heard, for example, just parallel to the AFS business. So it's kind of constantly fluctuating.
What's really important us is really the combined volume and pricing growth. And so for us, it's very clear that we're doing some great work in this area and monetization in aggregate is doing very well. And that's really what we're -- like on a quarter-to-quarter basis, don't panic about little movements here and there. Look at the fundamental trends, and that's where we're very pleased.
Now, did you have a first -- was there a first question that I missed, Mark?
Mark May - Citi
No. I was hoping on cloud that maybe you could put some numbers behind the level of traction in terms of number of customers impact on expenses, CapEx, the level of investment in the cloud.
Patrick Pichette
I see. Okay. So I've given you what I can give you on that. Again, we're really thrilled by the momentum there and our focus in that area.
Mark May - Citi
Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Mark. Jamie, we'll go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities
Thanks for taking the question. One for Omid. Going back to estimated total conversions, wondering if we could expect Adometry to be integrated into the DoubleClick platform and how that may or may not work with the estimated total conversions tool? And then, finally, I'm wondering [Audio Gap] on your work around coming up with a solution that reduces the dependence upon cookies and perhaps introduces a cross-platform, a cross-device ID for Google and what impact that could have in the market? Thank you.
Omid Kordestani
Sure. I think -- again, it's early for us to call Adometry. It's a great attribution solution and we've been investing in that tool for a long time now and trying to just get this right by all the innovation that's happening within Google and just really understanding the impact of these usage models and -- between the mobile devices and desktop.
And so I think we're going to look at everything that's available out there, both what we're developing and partners out there that we could partner with, and continue to invest here. It's going to take us a while, just like we experienced before with search, to get this right and have a real end-to-end solution for marketers and publishers. And so I think you will see a lot of innovation in this space. What Facebook recently announced is another approach. And we're going to study that and just figure out what is the right set of offerings from us.
So I guess, unfortunately, I can't give you a very specific answer here. But I think what you'll see from us is pay a huge amount of attention here, make the measurements and see the impact and then offer a full suite to our customers.
Patrick Pichette
Yeah. So just basically, too early to speculate on these issues, but clearly it's an area of focus at the company. Thank you, Peter. Jamie, our next question, please?
Operator
And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you. I had two questions. The first was a follow-up on Google Shopping Express. I mean, just wondering, when you think about what Amazon is doing with same-day delivery, they're obviously building these fulfillment centers themselves, which theoretically should give them scale over time. I'm wondering if you could share with us how you see this evolving for Google over time?
And then a follow-up question would just be related to your comments about payments. And I'm just wondering, how critical is it for Google itself to [Audio Gap] friction that you're seeing with kind of a ubiquitous digital wallet? Or would you be fine with a third-party doing so for the Android platform?
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Heather. I'll take the first and then let Omid answer the second. Clearly, Google Shopping Express, there is an issue of scale and it's a combination of an issue of scale, tools and efficiency. I mean, that's how you, if you think over time, can end up with a product that you can deliver within kind of hours at the right value and where you can make money.
So it's not only about -- yes, for efficiencies you need centralization. You need a bunch of distribution tools that actually work. We're clearly focused on that as well. I mean it is part of the business case that we're building. But you need more than that. There's a lot of other elements as well. So clearly focused like our competitors would be. And our announcements today, again kind of our -- was it yesterday -- yesterday's announcements on Shopping Express kind of tell you that we are investing both for -- the three new cities kind of give you a hint of, yes, it's about scale. So clearly we're focused on that.
Omid Kordestani
Yeah. And Heather, on the wallet question, I think we're going to continue to be open here. So we are trying to get it right and innovating on multiple fronts, as I mentioned earlier. And if partnering makes sense, we'll take a look at it, as well.
So -- and the goal is here really to provide this very seamless experience for the users and then get the merchant adoption and hopefully get this right. I'm certainly delighted every time I use this and it works. And I think if we can all get the ecosystem right and there are multiple players in it and partnerships that are making it happen, we're definitely open to that.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Heather. Let's go to our next question.
Operator
And we'll go next to Paul Vogel with Barclays.
Paul Vogel - Barclays
Yeah. Great. Thank you very much. As Google Play has grown, I'm just wondering if you could talk about the relationships with the carriers and how that's evolving over time.

Yeah, I can answer that. So, essentially, Google Play is doing great and everybody wants to kind of be part of this answer. And so, for our carriers, [Audio Gap] basis. So the real question is, what's the win-win? And so they're all done individually. We have great partnerships with many carriers that actually fuel this, and we're including carrier billing. So all this actually is just a very, very positive ecosystem for us. And so we're totally thrilled to have these partnerships and we expect to continue to do so.
Paul Vogel - Barclays
Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Paul. Jamie, one more question.
Operator
And we'll take our final question from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies
Great. Thanks for the questions. Two for video -- on video for Omid. You mentioned Google Preferred in your comments. Any color on further expanding the upfront process with the ad agencies? Basically, do you anticipate that upwards of 5% to 10% of your top inventory could actually be set aside for preferred longer-term?
And then just given the shift of offline TV dollars to online, as you've mentioned, any comments on political specifically or other new categories more aggressively moving on to YouTube? Thanks so much.
Omid Kordestani
Sure. Thank you, Brian. So we secured upfront commitments from five top agencies: IPG, OMD, Digitas, Carat, SMG, and some major brands like General Motors and Coca-Cola and we were actually very, very pleased with how Google Preferred was experienced and adopted. And so I think we're going to definitely continue working on this. And also if you look at our history, we're very used to the selling model that was all about performance. And then as we added properties like YouTube and Brand and Mobile, we're just getting more and more now gaining a better understanding of how to work in this upfront process, for example, to offer the marketers this incredible asset that we have in YouTube and our network. So we're going to just continue getting better at -- on the products side, figure out how to package this inventory better, and then the tools that are needed, and then on the selling side, just get better at also working with the agencies and our advertisers and marketers to get this type of selling right.
And on the political vertical, I think clients love to use our products as part of their campaigns for federal, local, state campaigns and it is a really great area for us. We have actually a political sales team that's focused on it. So I think you'll see more of that effort from us.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies
Omid, thanks.
Omid Kordestani
Thank you very much.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Brian. Jamie, that's all the time we have. So if you don't mind, I'd just like to close by reiterating what Omid said a bit earlier. This quarter was a great quarter with great momentum again. And I just wanted to thank all the great efforts of our Googlers around the world who make us look good on this call because of their fantastic effort.
So with that, Jamie, I'll let you close the call, and have a happy Q4 everyone.
Operator

Presentation
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google Inc. Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Jane Penner, Director of IR. Please go ahead ma'am.
Jane Penner
Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Google's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.
Also as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations Web site located at investor.google.com. So, please refer to our IR Web site for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call.
You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations' page for latest Company news and updates. Please check it out. This call is also being Webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our Web site later today.
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Please note these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward look statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and restructuring. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2014 earnings call. So I will dive right into the numbers. Nikesh is going to give you a business update and then we will open-up for Q&A. So let’s dive into the details of our financial performance for Q2.
Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 22% year-over-year to $16 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would in fact have been 21% year-over-year, still very healthy.
Our Google site revenue was up 23% year-over-year to $10.9 billion and was up 4% quarter-over-quarter driven by strength in our core search advertising business.
Our Network revenue was up 7% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was up 1% quarter-over-quarter driven by year-over-year growth in our AdMob and Ad Exchange businesses.
Finally, Google other revenue grew 53% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play Store drove the year-over-year growth.
Our global aggregate paid click was strong this quarter, up 25% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPC were down 6% year-over-year, but flat quarter-over-quarter.
And without currency fluctuation, aggregate cost per click would have been down 7% year-over-year. So currency had a very minimal -- and currency had no impact on quarter-over-quarter CPC growth.
As we indicated in our last earnings call, we’re now disclosing paid clicks and cost per click changes by property type in addition to aggregate numbers. So to that end, Google sites paid clicks were up 33% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google site CPC were down 7% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter.
On the Network side, network paid clicks were up 9% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. And our network CPCs were down 13% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter.
Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors at an aggregate level, including geographic mix, device mix, property mix, as well as our ongoing product and policy changes. And since we’re now disclosing additional property metrics related to our monetization, it maybe helpful to remind you all of what we include in each property. So let’s start with sites.
Sites monetization metrics includes ads that were served on Google owned and operated properties across different geographies and form factors. So these properties include YouTube search obviously -- YouTube engagement ads like TrueView, and then other owned and operated properties such like Maps or Finance and otherwise.
Our Network monetization metrics include ads served on non-Google properties participating in our AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, and AdMob businesses. We also provide corresponding historical data since Q1 of 2013 for reference, which can be found on -- in our earnings slides.
Nikesh and I’ll obviously be happy to respond as usual to your question about our Q2 monetization in the Q&A today. But I’m sure that some of you may have detailed questions about monetization trends from prior quarters. And to help you with that, the IR team will be ready to answer your questions after the call.
Turning to geographic performance, we saw solid performance in the U.S. and U.K and continued strong performance in rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor Relations' website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world, to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please do refer to these slides for the exact calculations.
The U.S. revenue was up 12% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. The U.K. was up 22% to $1.6 billion and in fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 15% year-over-year, a clear improvement from last quarter’s performance.
As we’ve mentioned in previous quarters, our AdSense for search business skews toward the U.S and the U.K. And our ongoing user focused product and policy changes have continued to have a clear impact on our revenue growth in these two geographies.
Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 31% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, and this accounted for 48% of our total revenue, which includes a $6 million benefit from our hedging program. So in FX term, the rest of the world grew also 31% year-over-year.
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue this quarter. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.7 billion in Q2. This is excluding stock-based compensation.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.8 billion, again excluding SBC and as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5.1 billion and our non-GAAP operating margin stood at 32% in Q2.
Headcount was up, roughly 2,200 people in Q2 in the last 90 days. And in total, we ended the quarter with approximately 52,000 full-time employees, but please note that the headcount does include approximately 3,500 full-time employees from the Motorola business.
Our effective tax rate was 21% in Q2. Our tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continued mix shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
Let me now turn to cash management. Our OI&E, our other income and expense was $145 million for the quarter. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. And for more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR Web site.
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.6 billion. And CapEx for the quarter was $2.6 billion. This quarter, the majority of the CapEx spend was related to data center construction, real estate purchases and finally production equipment in that order. Investor should see our investment in CapEx as a positive signal, since it reflects our sustained optimism about Google’s business.
As I’ve mentioned before, we will continue to invest for the long-term and our infrastructure and real estate assets remain a key strategic area of investment for us. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $3 billion.
And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. The team continues to be hard at work and we look forward to seeing them join with the Lenovo team soon. Motorola had a great Q2 with the Moto E and Moto G, both showing strong sales momentum especially in emerging markets.
So there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to continue to fund strategic growth opportunities in many areas including our CapEx area that we talked about earlier.
And now I'll let Nikesh cover some more details on our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks, I will take it back to open-up the phone lines for questions. Here you go Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. You’ve had an amazing last few months at Google and our focus in creating great multi skin experience is paying off. I hope you saw our annual IO Developer Conference a few weeks ago. We were joined by over 6,000 developers in San Francisco along with approximately 1.9 million people globally tuning in online.
We unveiled the upcoming Android L release. We also showed how we’re expanding android platform to cars, watches, TVs, as well as making it easy to search Google from anywhere by simply saying okay Google. Making magical products that people love using everyday is what drives our ambition, fuels our business.
Last quarter we saw strong growth with $16 billion in gross revenue. We saw particular strength in the travel and retail verticals as well as in several countries like Japan and India.
By now you know the four areas driving our business. One, performance or direct response marketing; two helping clients build their brands; third our ad tech platforms for agencies and publishers; and four, our emerging businesses like digital content, enterprise, and hardware.
I’ll quickly go through each of them and this quarter I want to highlight the investments we’re making to serve the small businesses. Firstly, in performance advertising, in the long-term we’re battling towards a world where people jump seamlessly across screens of all sizes on all types of surfaces.
In today’s world, unlocking the mobile phone opportunity is absolutely key for every marketeer and we’re seeing tremendous amounts of momentum here. We’ve been building popular mobile app formats for years like showcasing a businesses location or click to call, etcetera.
The teams are laser focused on making ad campaigns easier across screens and helping businesses measure their effectiveness across devices as well as offline. We already offer great solutions for marketeers wanting to promote app installs, in April at our AdWords performance forum, we supercharged our offerings for app developers across search, display and as well as YouTube.
We launched improvements like app deep linking and search to help developers re-engage users, who have already downloaded their app, better targeting options in AdMob to help them recent most likely customers, even a new app install format on YouTube and more powerful measurement tools, so they know exactly how their app is performing at every stage.
Mobile hotel booking app Hotel Tonight uses mobile search ads as a the key part of their global marketing efforts because it drives consistently high value users or more likely to purchase quickly in the apps. In fact, international mobile search campaigns drive three times higher conversion rates compared to other direct response channels.
We’re also seeing tremendous amounts of momentum in the retailer segments, product listing ads across screen. In fact this past quarter, we sent over three times as much traffic to merchants on smartphones and tablet devices compared to Q2 of last year.
Let me go to the second area of brand building. I recently spend some times at Cannes Lions Festival. I know it was working Canne, where Google had a big presence, hosting over 300 meetings with creative agencies and brands. What was actually interesting this year was how much the conversation with brands has changed from years past. Whereas digital used to be just one channel, today’s brand are putting digital at the center of the brand building campaign.
We see this from our clients as well and video seems to be the linchpin of the strategy. YouTube continues to be driven by the insanely popular channels from some of our top content creators like breakout hip -- hit Epic Rap Battles of History and new sensation Vice News.
We launched our Google Preferred Video offering at BrandCast in April, giving marketeers access to top content at YouTube and we’ve gotten phenomenal amount of support from agencies and brands so far.
Digitas was our first agency to sign on and since then Omnicom Media Group has also pledged their support. Brands including General Motors, Coca Cola, and Universal Pictures are also having tremendous amounts of success as Google preferred. Adidas was one of the major brands to leverage our global platform to reach fans during the World Cup. They engaged soccer fans by live streaming events with athletes, promoted them on YouTube through TrueView ads, as well as using beautiful light box ads across our display network.
Now a few words about our ad technologies for agencies and publishers. Again, video is at the forefront of our efforts here. Last month we introduced a premium programmatic video marketplace called Google Partner Select to help publishers monetize their video content and to help agencies reach top quality video content across the Web.
The feedback that we’ve gotten from agencies and publishers has been great. We continue to see strong growth across premium inventory, particularly with the growth of private exchanges across AdMob and AdSense publishers are increasing their investments in mobile sites and apps and growing their businesses using our platforms.
Before I move on to our emerging businesses, I want to talk about an area we continue to invest in, online tools for small businesses. Small businesses are the cornerstone of the world’s economy and a major priority for us at Google. But there is still a huge opportunity as over 50% of SMBs still don’t have a Web site. To help set them up for online success; last month we introduced Google My Business, which helps small businesses manage their online presence across search, maps and Google+.
We also have a vibrant ecosystem of partners who have local businesses optimize their AdWords campaigns and we’ve been improving our customer support for small businesses. In fact, over the last few years, we’ve doubled our advertiser customer satisfaction scores which bodes really well.
Now, let me talk about emerging new businesses, digital content, enterprise and hardware. Google Play continues to grow at breakneck speed across all types of digital content, helping developers and content partners reach users around the world. For instance, Play Movies is now available in over 90 countries, with its recent additions in Argentina, Poland and the Czech Republic.
We also recently signed deals with CBS TV and Viacom to bring their TV content to Google Play. With over a 1 billion active android users to going success of Google Play, means that more developers are building successful global businesses in our platform. As we mentioned at IO, since last June, we paid out more than $5 billion to developers through Play which clearly means it’s a growing business for us as well.
Shifting gears to our enterprise business, I can report that over 60% of the Fortune 500 use our paid products. This quarter we added even more like Rockwell Collins. They signed up 20, 00 employees to use Google apps.
We also launched Google Drive for work, a premium service of businesses that includes unlimited storage. The reception so far has been great and we even closed our first sale within minutes of the announcement. Our cloud platform business also has momentum with new features announced at IO.
On the hardware side, over 1 million Chromebooks were sold into schools. Clearly a record quarter and the popularity of Chromecast continues to grow. Now available in Australia, Korea, Portugal and many more. I got to watch some World Cup games from the ESPN app using my Chromecast.
Before I close, I want to mention our marketing team, in addition to a great IO this year, we also launched the Made with Code initiatives with partners like Girl Scouts with the USA and Girls to Code, to inspire the next generation of women coders. We are really excited about the enthusiasm around this initiative and who knows hopefully some of this chorus will join us at Google.
With that, I’d like to thank today all the Googlers around the world who helped make this a fantastic quarter. On a personal note, as you might have seen, I’m moving on to a new adventure. I’d like to thank Larry and Sergey and the founders of Google, my colleagues and Larry’s staff as well as everyone at Google for the amazing experiences and the phenomenal 10 years I’ve had. I look forward to working with them in the future and cheering them from the sidelines.
I’ll hand back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. And as you’ve just heard, this will be Nikesh’s last call. So I want to take a minute on behalf of Nikesh, your friends here at Google, your colleagues and also all of Google -- all of our Googlers, to thank you for all of your contributions to Google over like what has been really a decade of work. So thank -- huge thanks. Well many of you on the call may have questions about transition, if you don’t mind, we’d like to the keep the discussion focused on our performance in the last quarter, if you don’t mind. So that’s really where we will focus our questions.
And with that, why don’t I turn it over to Jamie who will line us up for our Q&A. Jamie?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Mark Mahaney with RBC.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Thank you. Two quick questions. The recovery in the growth rate in the U.K., could you provide more color around that or was it just you had hard comps last quarter, but the growth rate really consistent with what you had seen before. And then there was been some recent reporting about YouTube revenues. Could you just clarify even if its just historical data, the size of that asset? And any more color around the growth there, new monetization initiatives etcetera. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Yes, so it’s Patrick. And as we -- Mark as we’ve discussed in the last quarter, we had talked about the U.K. having had a tough comp the year before. So you can see basically the recovery of that in the numbers and we’re pretty pleased with the momentum there. In terms of YouTube, I mean we -- I know there has been lot of speculation out there, but in essence, where we’ve is a great opportunities in front of us and we don’t comment on outside estimates. YouTube, you know it serves as a powerful starting point for advertisers, for looking to anchor their brand campaigns online and coupled with the online measurement of the digital audience is being Neilsen, ComScore, everything that we just announced over the last couple quarter, right. Clearly a great runway ahead of it. So that’s basically the story on YouTube.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Thank you, Patrick.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks. Jamie, what’s our next question please?
Operator
We will go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric Sheridan - UBS
Thanks for taking the question. I guess, on the cash may be you can give update on your e-commerce initiatives. You called out retail as one of the strongest verticals in the quarter. Why didn’t you get a little more detail on what (indiscernible) in San Francisco? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Yes, thanks Eric for your question. I think two quick answers that, as we’ve talked in the past PLAs is actually a fundamental sort of existential need of our product. So research business, because as people go to tablets, as people go to mobile devices, they’re looking for more and more precise answers when they search and the ability for them to go directly to the entity they’re searching for is phenomenally powerful when you’re searching lots for these things and Sridhar and his team have done a great job working with every retail out there, try and get as many products listed. And our product listing service, so when you actually search you get a plethora of option in terms of where you can buy the product, what it’s priced at and how many products are available in their category. So it’s actually very, very good evolution from a search perspective, which clearly translates into people clicking on those and thereafter hopefully driving more commerce towards our partners and retail segment. As I said, we drove three times as much traffic this quarter’s and we did same time last year. So its clearly good. In terms of Google shopping express, its start of as an experiment, clearly I use that delighted with the service. I mean, I cant seem to find people who are not happy with Google shopping express. And we’re seeing tremendous results. We’re learning a lot. We are getting a logistics right. We’re getting our processes right and you believe its clearly an opportunity for us and our teams are really, really excited about continuing to invest in that area and you keep experiment with different formats and different solutions to make sure that we can provide the most optimized experience to our users. Yes, just a point of clarification, you talked about an overnight service in San Francisco. In fact, we’ve launched overnight deliver in all of northern California. But that continues to be an amazing demand for the product?
Patrick Pichette
Thanks and good luck going forward Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thanks, Erik.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you very much. Jamie, let’s go to our next question please.
Operator
And we will go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
Nikesh, good luck in your new role from me as well. Patrick when you’re budgeting for some of the longer term projects and you’re trying to think about sort of a timeframe to get to profitability. For instance, the team at Google X or Google fiber or something on self driving cars. How do you think about the timeframe for getting to profitability? Is there any general rule on how far away it needs to be? And related to that, in terms of the potential financial contribution within the next say three to five years. What are the new initiatives that you expect to have the most impact? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question, Ben. And what you really have is, as I’ve explained many times before, we set up our kind of governance around a bit of like a BC model where we actually have gating and funding. And projects that have -- there are more software based. We will have much shorter life times before we expect a bunch of returns. Projects that are much more kind of fundamental physics R&D, will have much longer life, like kind of timelines for actually funding and expected milestones. But in both cases they’re all set around the boundaries of -- you have a business case, you have a thesis and that thesis is basically tested on a regular basis through the gating of the funding that they get. And in some cases like self driving cars, obviously multiyear and we’ve a couple of other projects and (indiscernible) of that nature were it will take -- we think of kind of half decade, sometimes even a bit longer before we know that -- you can get kind of real momentum on revenue and profitability. Others are much shorter. So that’s how we kind of think about it. What matters most is really that we actually set up that gating and that we have these refinements to the business models and you know Google Shopping Express another great example of that where you just kind of have the gating and then they come back for funding every so many months to kind of look at where its going. So that’s what we have in terms of the next three to five years, I wouldn’t be able to comment on the specifics of anyone of those, but you can basically through the guidance I’ve just given you. You can come through what is really an asset in terms of versus a software kind of intensive kind of play and then it gives you a guidance of how fast and how slow we should expect our returns to be.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
Great. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Ben. Great question. Jamie let’s go to our next question please.
Operator
And we will go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, thank you. Couple ones. You mentioned on the prepared remarks that the U.S growth has been impacted by some of the network changes. I don’t suppose you could quantify it, but please do if you can. When do you think you kind of work through all those changes and we can start seeing a normalized growth rate or maybe you can answer by how far you’re along that process? And then the second question, pretty excited about Google Play opportunity. Can you just tell us what -- what’s the margin opportunity related to Google Play or the profit opportunity? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
I will take the first and then I will let Nikesh talk about the second. On the first one, we have -- we’ve talked about this again as you said so rightly Justin, we have talked about a couple of things going on right as early as -- early kind of Q1 of 2013 we announced these DLA policy changes and you all remember that and we also reminded you at the time that by announcing these changes, it will take time to actually flow through to a bunch of partners across 2013. So clearly there is an effect there on a year-over-year basis, as it all -- it didn’t all happen in Q1 of ’13. In addition to that, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we continue to have ongoing user focused product changes and they continue to impact our AFS business is an example. So AFS, right and then what you end up with is you all remember that AFS or AdWords for search -- essence for search, it really skews to the U.S and the U.K. And because of that, that’s why you see the disproportion into those results. So on the DLA obviously, they will lapse over the course of this year and -- but the additional kind of continued product changes and user focused product changes and policy changes will continue to kind of hammer them to make sure that we get the perfect balance between what is right for the user and what’s right for the advertiser. And so that’s why all in all, I feel pretty confident in what I said, when I said that we’re pretty pleased with our growth rate in the U.S. As for the Play, why don’t I actually let Nikesh give you a bit of comment on that?
Nikesh Arora
I think its important to step back and look at what the Google Play team has achieved. I mean its -- it come from nowhere. It’s a phenomenal platform which provides services, apps, content around the world as we mentioned over 90 countries of Google Play movies. And as Patrick would say, $5 billion developer which is 5,000 million, so lot of money. And its actually really great for innovation. Its phenomenal for the app developer ecosystem and it’s a really good binding glue for the android ecosystem, because people find tremendous (indiscernible) and all the apps and all the services they get at Google Play. For us we’re really, really very excited about the Google Play opportunity. I think in terms of margin, you should be able to look at the market and understand how typically these relationships work and should we know different than what the current market is around the margin opportunity for services in the long-term.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Justin. Jamie, let’s go to our next question please.
Operator
We will go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Thanks guys. I have two questions, product related. So at IO you announced some new innovation in search and discovery for apps, including opening up app indexing globally. So what kind of timeline do you think Google is on before we start to see a lot of app content appearing in core search results more regularly and what kind of revenue opportunity do you see around that? And then the second question somewhat related is you also announced a bunch of new screen for android, watches, TVs etcetera. I know its still very early days, but do you envision the long-term business model for these being similar to the existing model with ads in Google Play or do you see potentially feeling close loop transactions as an example? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Ross, thank you for your question. Let’s talk about the app indexing first and then about the screen stuff. I mean, if you think about it, Google has been in the business of making sure that we drive traffic on behalf of people and advertise and help people find things. And as you look at mobile phone behavior, people spend a lot of time on apps as well as in the browser searching for things. So I think it’s important for us to make sure that we provide the content that users are looking for. So, you should expect us to most aggressively try and make sure that App Indexing all happens and its available and easily accessible across devices and people are looking for things we’ve provided them the most relevant answer in which in certain cases that happens to be the app. So allowing for people to discover apps as well as creating more engagement for apps that people may not have been engaging with for a while. So, I think clearly an area of focus and clearly you should see -- expect us to see activity in that space. And in terms of revenue its not unlike any revenue we cerate in the search where we help people find things and that allows us to create an advertising opportunity where people are -- we’re able to monetize that on behalf of sort of our properties. In terms of your second question, I think you have to take a longer term point of view towards the screen question. As you can see all the screens are sort of almost designed as island where every screen has its own operating system, has its own ability to work. But we’re noticing more and more people want to switch from screens and retain the service experience. And towards that end, the android team is doing a phenomenal job making sure that we provide that seamlessness across screens and the fungibility of services across those screens. So, I think long-term we have to think about this as a user centric model. We’re helping users take their services fungibily from one screen to the other and making that happen seamlessly. And if that works out I think there is will phenomenal business opportunities for us in the future. But at Google we always worry about the user first and we’ll figure out the monetization when we have a lot of users excited about it.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Jamie, why don’t we go to our next question?
Operator
And we’ll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
Thank you. Two questions if I may. One on revenue, is there a significant positive net impact of growing penetration in usage of smartphones on search place and revenue? And what happens to search revenue growth if there is no more benefit in developed markets as smartphone penetration approaches a 100%? Second, you added more than 2,400 employees to Google in the quarter versus 1,400 in the second quarter last year; I think that’s the highest quarter of the headcount addition in more than two years. Patrick, it is the new normal in terms of the rate in which you grow headcounts for the core. How do you think about the rate of headcount growth versus gross profit or you don’t think about it at all? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Let me tackle that second one and then I’ll let Nikesh, talk about the first one. On the issue of headcount, look we have this amazing opportunity and machine to actually look around the world to look for the best engineers. And we promised ourselves that, given the bar it’s very, very high. When we do find people that fit the culture and that we think will actually do a great contribution and be great Googlers, we actually don’t hesitate and we hire them. Because if we hire them a bit too early or a bit too late it might unbalance, we’re very happy to have them early on. You’re right that, if you look at the last couple of quarters I mean the trend has been pretty kind of solid. And in addition to that you have to look at the impact also of our acquisitions when we make acquisitions that kind of compound’s a bit the numbers. But from that perspective Carlos, we don’t set up a specific target we say we’re going to end up with X amount for this quarter and then that once we hit our quarter we see everybody else next quarter. So from that perspective we’re a bit more organic about it. And we are -- the vast majority of our hiring to kind of give comfort to our investors is, it is really still in the engineering field and the product management field which is really where we want to focus our attention, and we continue to focus there. So, that’s basically the puzzle with which we work. On the question, maybe Nikesh can talk about revenue and smartphone penetration.
Nikesh Arora
Yes, of course (indiscernible) the answer is, yes. As we see more and more users with penetration of smartphones, people spend more time looking for things in their smartphones. And I think there’s a very, very long sort of runway that this opportunity has, because we’re just seeing people getting on to smartphones. Now you’re beginning to see businesses and other websites take mobile very, very seriously. They want to be present on mobile. I think the revenue opportunity is phenomenally high, because right now mobile does not monetize as well as certain other forms. But given the huge influx of queries we’re seeing, we expect as people make it more and more relevant to be able to find information in the long-term, mobile should be monetizing even better than desktops. So, I think as a tremendous runway going forward, I don’t think we have to fear the sort of saturation of smartphone penetration in developed markets for a while.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Carlos. We’ll take our next question, Jamie.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities
Thanks very much. Patrick, can you give us an update on your internet access initiatives particularly Google Fiber. Maybe update us on the evolution of the economics of that business and then perhaps even the timing of the Google Fiber rollout for more recently announced cities? And then a separate question on the Google Compute Engine business. How big of a growth driver can GCE be? And what do you guys see as the competitive advantage that Google has and what seems to be an increasingly competitive space in terms of the Cloud? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
So why don’t I jump on the first one, and Nikesh if you don’t mind talking about GCE afterwards. Look, here’s what's going on with Google Fiber. It’s important to bear in mind the following. First is, the economics of a fiber network today are clearly much cheaper than they were say a decade ago. There have been a lot of improvements in cost reductions and technology components all through the fiber network, but also in the way we build it. The second one is, I just want to remind everyone that, an important part of our strategy is actually to build the demand. So, unlike the typical over builder, actually we have a very different kind of business model and thesis for that. And we do work closely with each city to streamline the process that keeps again the cost of construction way down. So, as an update to you right now, Anthony we have as you know we are working with 34 cities, separate cities with a kind of completed checklist of items to help us prepare for the next kind of wave of our construction project. And we’re going to be basically, they are in the last rows of finishing these checklists and its coming back with us. Over the coming months we’ll actually be going through all of the details with them, whether it would be write away or permitting or otherwise, and that’s what we’re going to use to make decisions as to how broad a program will have. We expect that to kind of give an update between now and the end of the year as the information comes along. So, we’re really thrilled about the opportunity. It continues to be kind of a great piece of focus for us. And just stay tuned for more, the next update on it. As per the GCE, do you want to take it Nikesh or?
Nikesh Arora
Yes. So I think, what's very important on sense, we’ve talked about this in the past, that we believe there is a lot of businesses out there have still to shift to the Cloud. We think in the long-term every business will be most efficient when they shift to the Cloud. So we’re not really concerned about trying to compete with other Cloud providers. What we’re really concerned about is making sure we have an amazing offering for businesses so they find value in working with us and making sure that we can support them in their transition to the Cloud. We think we have a great set of products. Our team is really excited, we’re beginning to ramp up. So, I think there is tremendous opportunity going forward. I think it won’t be time to slice the pie for a long time because a lot of businesses are clambering to move their business to the Cloud, because that’s where the users already are, because we’re used to the Cloud and are personalized and its about time that our businesses that we work in actually got to the bleeding edge of technology as much as the consumer services are.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities
Thank you very much.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Anthony. Jamie, lets go to our next caller please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Mark May with Citigroup.
Mark May - Citigroup
Thanks for taking my questions. A follow-up on the network business. I think some of the quality initiatives that you’ve been undergoing and continued too for a while, part of the intended consequence result I would imagine would be to recognize higher overall CPCs or pricing every time, but that doesn’t seem to have been the case so far. So, I wonder if you could shed a whole light as to why we’re not seeing that show up in some of the metrics of kind of what your expectations are going forward, is that in fact one of the intended consequences that we should be expecting going forward? And then secondly, you’ve highlighted not just this quarter, but previously that one of the main headwinds to the company’s overall CPCs has been the mix shift around geography. I wonder if you could shed some light on if you’ve been seeing or making any progress in closing the gap there maybe in markets like APAC and what exactly are you doing to try to improve pricing outside the domestic and more stylish markets?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, so Mark, it’s Patrick. I think that you really pointed a fact that we are spending, there’s so many factor’s. The issue we have with the CPC -- one of the key things about CPC is clearly it gives you a trend, but the trend is really shaped by the combination of CPC and clicks. So, you can’t just look at one in isolation of the other, it’s really that mix of the two. And in the case of network for example, I mean we just discussed at the beginning of the call that, we’ve put a lot of time and a lot of energy in the last 18 months to actually work on quality issues. And that clearly has an impact when you push on quality to -- when you look at the mix to actually drive for the kind of revenues and growth rates that you see in our results on the network. Having said that, it’s also compensated by all of the other positive factors that we see whether it be as you said geography or product mix or otherwise. So, all in all I think that the team is doing a good job, both on network and on sites, and you can see that as well on our detailed information about, of sites where we continue to see the kind of -- or certainly over the last few quarters kind of creeping back up of CPCs which actually continue to push for this quality issue. In terms of geography, I think that yes, geography makes a big difference and that CPCs are much in some cases lower in international markets or emerging market. But the team continues with a number of localization initiatives to, like so we don’t take CPCs as just one general. We will focus on each country, look for initiatives on localizations for each country to get the maximum CPCs on a geographic basis country-by-country basis, and that’s why you’ll see a lot of localization initiatives. They’re just one again, one contributor. And it’s really early days. There’s so much potential in many of these areas and that’s why Sridhar’s team and our Search teams continue to work side-bye-side to continue to push on these areas. So, we see a lot of runway in this one, and geography is just one of these areas. And you mentioned like APAC, but APAC was a combination of more mature markets like Australia and Japan, and then we had the real emerging markets in there as well like Indonesia or India. So, even APAC itself is again localization matters immensely because very different answers for different countries. But all in all a pretty good story, and we’re really proud to continue to focus with this balance between user first and then make sure that we have the right monetization. So, thanks for your question, Mark. Jamie, lets go to our next question please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask two things. First thing to the added disclosure just on volume and CPCs. If we look at the sites data on pricing, it looks like we’ve seen an inflection here over the last two quarters, and then now more flattish here sequentially in 2Q. Can we interpret from that, that we’ve seen the worst in terms of the negative pricing impact from mobile? And can you give us some color on what you’re seeing in terms of like-for-like mobile pricing as this point? And then secondly just on CapEx, Patrick, can you just help us understand how your philosophy may be has changed around CapEx spending over the last few years and if you’re in this period of building out potentially a lot of excess capacity, is it reasonable to think you’re at some point over the next few quarters we can also see things slow down as the business grows into that spending more? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
So, Douglas let me start with the last question first and then I’ll jump to the first. On CapEx, listen, if you listen to the script I gave a couple of minutes ago, interestingly this quarter that in priority order was construction of datacenters. Second was actually real-estate which typically would have been historically, you would have heard me talk about kind of equipment, and then equipment was third. So, CapEx continues -- we think continues to be a strategic asset of ours. And you’re correct, and we’ve signaled that, that we’re actually building -- we have a big building program right now because these are long lead time items for our datacenters, and we’ve just talked about a minute ago about GCE and other Cloud services that continue to grow. So, to strategically have the capacity versus not having the capacity is such a strategic asset to us that will continue to look at way. In terms of real-estate we found the same time. We found that we have, when we have opportunities to actually acquire real-estate that it’s a make versus so buy versus lease option. And if you think of our growth and the growth in the strategic areas where we want to be, when we find great opportunities I think that we have a no-regret move in actually taking that action. So, you’re seeing more activities on that front which answers a bit, a lot of questions have been around, is the core business kind of capital intensity growing? Well you can see from these kind of data points that it’s not really that, it’s really a strategic focus that we have right now in making sure that we have the long-term assets necessary to win. So, that’s basically the mindset in which we’re kind of investing in CapEx. In the volume of CPCs, you’re talking about more flattish sequential in Q2, this is for sites I assume. Was that for sites?
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
For sites, and the lower or smaller decline over the last two quarters?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, again I would refer you back to the IR team to get a lot of more detailed questions. But I think on a quarterly basis there can be so many fluctuations. I think year-over-year gives you a much more kind of realistic trend about what is fundamentally going on in the business, because one or two changes can really kind of swing, even seasonality can swing quite a bit both in terms of growth rates or CPCs -- clicks and CPCs. So, be aware always of -- and if you can see that in the network numbers, clearly on the quarter-over-quarter as well there is a lot of noise in the data. So you have to be careful in the quarter-over-quarter. But year-over-year actually gives you a pretty good story of the efforts we’re putting into this. That’s how I would do it. Thank you very much for your questions. Jamie, lets go to our next question please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities
Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to revisit the topic of small business for a second. Could you help us understand a little bit on some of the qualities of the small business growth profile? Is this about bringing businesses that have no online identity online or is it about taking more mature small businesses and getting a greater share of the spending? Just wondering if you could step back and maybe give yourself a report card on the small business progress you’ve made and where the best opportunities are? Thanks very much.
Nikesh Arora
Thanks Peter for the question. I think again, if you think about the phenomenal scale at which the Google team operates vis-à-vis small businesses it’s staggering. And we have millions of advertisers, millions of publishers we deal with. And we’re trying to make sure that millions of publishers get monetization through advertising at the same time we’re trying to work, make sure that millions of small businesses achieve their goals in trying to drive traffic both online and offline into whatever services they’re offering to their end users. Now, as we’ve gone through this transition to mobile and it’s very important that these small businesses make their transition effectively, because all the user traffic is slowly and steadily shifting towards mobile. And part of our effort is to make sure that we work closely with all of our small business advertisers existing to help them go mobile, at the same time trying to bring on more small businesses both onto the mobile and the desktop platform. So, it’s really a concerted effort to try and support small businesses around the world through very targeted program’s to show them ROI, to show them the value of living online because we believe in the long-term that’s where most businesses are going to get conducted. So, it’s really a long-term strategic effort to bring them all onboard, and I think the teams are doing a phenomenal job executing that ground.
Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities
Thanks for the color, Nikesh.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Peter. Jamie lets go to our next question please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two, I guess, given the success of Chromebooks over the past few years, how you think about the direction of Android and Chrome from a development standpoint as you look out, and also when you think about the multi-screen comments that you made before, that the value being able to transfer peoples experiences across screens?
Patrick Pichette
Did you say, you had two questions Heather?
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yes, and then I had a second one which just I was going to start with that one since it was long winded. And then the second one was just, Google Shopping Express seems to be a great way to impact the small business environment. I’m just wondering now that we’re seeing that expand into different areas. Is that kind of the, should we start to see an inflection in small business advertising adoption?
Patrick Pichette
Okay, we’ve got the two questions. I think Google Shopping Express is really about local and local is really about both small businesses as well as large businesses. So, it really -- so absolutely small businesses will be as part of the focus area. And we’re engaging with many of them which is actually pretty terrific, but it’s really about local. So it’s not only with the focus of small businesses, and that’s really the focus of Shopping Express. In the case of Chromebook’s and Android, I mean we’ve discussed this many times in the past where basically you have a great convergence because there is humongous strength in both of these platforms, and they’re basically converging in many ways. Today you can get -- for example, on an Android phone right Chrome kind of powers the search and vice versa. So we have a lot of these cross-pollinization between the two teams. They’re under one leadership which is Sundar, and he basically actually makes sure that these two teams continue to work into an integrated fashion. Everybody knows that Chrome has a huge focus on security, and that is in fact a great focus to kind of migrate over into the Android ecosystem to make sure that we have kind of the equivalent of enterprise grade security for all of our users whether they be Chrome or Android. So, I think that, when you think of multi-screen there are both of these OSS are actually very complementary to each other, and that’s why we continue to kind of work in parallel. I think that across these multi-screens you should expect, Android continues to be very much the thing of choice for mass and Chrome continues to be very much the enterprise infrastructure, and you should continue to see kind of that evolve with that collaboration. So that’s how we think about it, Heather. There’s no kind of, its one or the other. I think that they are perfect compliments. So, thank you for your question. Jamie, we’ll go through our next question please.
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
Thank you very much. Two quick questions please. Going back to Doug’s question about CapEx; can you -- Patrick, can you give us any example of a non-search initiative where you’ve invested heavily over the last maybe three, four, five years where the ROI today exceeds your threshold, I’m assuming maybe on the display side. And then on the YouTube content strategy, how high in the professionally created content funnel do you want to get over time we’ve seen more and more professionally created content. So, if you can help us with that that will be great. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
I mean we have a whole host of products where they are, just think of display, think of YouTube, think of maps, think of -- I mean there’s been so many of these products that, Gmail, Chrome, Android I mean all of those, whether they are directly tied to advertising because they are an advertising product or they are a platform that actually gives you distribution that gives you a great infrastructure on which kind of that fuels the searches and the advertising. I think that we have so many areas that we get absolutely terrific return. So, it’s not only about search, it’s really about the entire experience and the delivery around them. Then your second question is, could you just repeat the second question for me please?
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
Sure. Just trying to understand the content strategy within YouTube, so just how high do you want to go up the professionally created content funnel, and how do you plan monetization if it’s all advertising or is there another model?
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Youssef for the question. I think it’s fair to say that YouTube has all forms of professional content available today. It has all the way from user content to very popular user content with people like Michelle Phan etcetera, and it has a lot of clips from professionally created content from various media partners we talked about CBS and Viacom in the earnings call. So, we have lots and lots of content from different players out there. And our monetization model in YouTube is working. It’s a phenomenal model. It is now the linchpin of each of our brand strategies if our partners and advertisers want to come work with us to create brand campaigns because YouTube allows you to actually target a fragmented set of interest in a most efficient fashion as opposed to try and do burst advertising that you would do in television and broadcast more. So, clearly the monetization model is working. In terms of other models as you’ve seen in the past we have experimented with various models on YouTube and we continue to experiment to see if advertising is the only model or there are ways that we can monetize using subscription of paid for content. I think that we will continue to do and see which ones in those sticks with the users.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
All right, thanks and all the best Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Patrick Pichette
Why don’t we go to our next question please, Jamie?
Operator
And we’ll go next to Richard Kramer with Arete Research.
Richard Kramer - Arete Research
Thanks very much. Nikesh, could you just expand on that last comment, putting together Google Fiber and a year on from YouTube channels. How important is it for Google over time to establish a subscription based type revenue stream especially if content moves to bundles. And for Patrick two things that would help us benchmark Google versus peers. First of all can you talk about the portion of ad growth or even the overall ad sales which are being driven by mobile? And also clearly there’s some questioning of the notion that large amounts of offshore cash can be permanently reinvested. Can you tell us what portion of cash is now offshore and how we should think about international opportunities that might absorb these very large volumes of cash? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Richard, thank you very much for the question. I think in terms of your question around Google Fiber, YouTube, content bundling, subscription, revenue streams, I think it’s a very good question and I think it’s an area where there’s a lot of moment across the board where different people are trying different models, where cable is trying to provide content over the top, where YouTube is available on television screens, where people are trying to increase the broadband speeds because everybody gets the sense that we will consume more and more broadband content. I think what's clear to us in this process is that bandwidths will continue to increase. People’s appetite for bandwidths will continue to grow up. It’s clear that people will consume content more and more in a non-linear fashion. And its clear that content will come from different places, not just the traditional mechanisms of cable and television. So, I think that’s pretty clear. It’s also clear that people will monetize content both either in some form of payment or some form of advertising. Beyond that how all of this sort of coagulates and takes form still remains to be seen. I think it’s fair to say, we are experimenting on different ends of the spectrum where we have like YouTube purely advertising based content and monetize today which is over the top which works on broadband. We have Google Fiber, we have channel bundle. So I think we are experimenting, we are playing in every space. And I think eventually the user will decide whatever is most convenient and most able to use, they will decide. But I think it’s fair to say we have a horse in every one of these races.
Patrick Pichette
That’s terrific. Let me jump into the second question. I’m going to once again kind of take a bit of exception through the premise of your argument about well how much is driven by mobile? We really are living in a multi-screen world. You start on mobile, you hop on tablet, you go to your desktop, you kind of come back to your television, you kind of Chromecast back to your TV, that’s the world in which we live. And when people say, how much of your advertising is really driven by one? And we do a lot of research that actually shows that, in fact that’s what we try to show to your advertisers is, how much attribution to kind of show to each of these elements which is in that chain of activities that actually leads to the end which is either a consumption of something or a purchase. So from that perspective that’s why we don’t actually talk about mobile as a percentage of ads. What really matters is that you have the footprint across all of these devices and modes to actually deliver the best answer to our users, and that’s why you heard about IO continuing to kind of expand that landscape. In the case of CapEx in international, like last quarter our offer cash was about kind of 60% and 40% in the U.S. We’ll share those numbers in our 10Q, so stay tuned. But in rough numbers that’s really where we stand today. It may move a percentage, here and there. We do have great opportunities outside the U.S. as well to actually invest our cash whether it be through acquisitions. You’ve seen a number of acquisitions in the last year that were made internationally as well as we’re building datacenters outside of the U.S. where our headquarters in Ireland continues to grow and we’re investing quite a bit of money there as well and to the real-estate. So, when you see our real-estate numbers, they may include over time a number of these projects in Ireland, but also in London and other places where we’re investing. So, we actually have pretty exciting plans for our international portfolio both in APAC and in Europe. And so there’s a real kind of great case to actually continue to keep this amount offshore. It’s not a shortage of opportunities that we have. So it’s just a question of pace and discipline. So, thank you for that.
Richard Kramer - Arete Research
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Richard. Maybe we have time for one more. We’ll take one more question.
Operator
And we’ll take our final question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, Nikesh, congratulations and good luck.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.
Firstly through Google Play and applications such as Shopping Express, there already is a transactional model in place in terms of purchases and payments. I guess, I wonder if it wouldn’t be natural to assume that some of that transactional functionality could be extended to Google Shopping and PLA more broadly, or is it really about just driving traffic to third party sites for those businesses. And then secondly just a clarification on the cost per click breakout from the report, why aggregated cost per click year-over-year growth is actually better than individually the Google sites and the network sites? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
I can actually give you the answer to the last one and then you can come back. It’s basically the Simpson's paradox. So, if you go on Wikipedia and you just check the Simpson's paradox you’ll understand that you may have two factors that are actually correlated in the same directions. But when you actually put them together they actually may correlate in an inverse proportion, and that’s where you get into the numbers and that’s why you have this kind of, the discrepancy because we all kind of laughed at this number as well because when we saw it, we said hey, something doesn’t add up and in fact it does add up. So, that’s really the issue there Colin. And unless you already know the Simpson's paradox then don’t go to Wikipedia.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.
I’ll search Google first.
Patrick Pichette
On the first question …
Nikesh Arora
And on the first -- I’m sorry.
Patrick Pichette
Go ahead, Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Okay. On the first question I think that’s a fair observation Colin, and I think if you look at some of the applications that our payments team has developed are on InstaBuy, it’s the ability to do a one click buy where we can partner with merchants and any kinds of transaction providers, where they don’t have to keep entering their data or entering their credit card in different places. So, it gives them the comfort, ease of transaction. So, I think over time its kind of line an open system solution where we have platforms where retailers can work with us and pick and choose what part of our platform they want to leverage and our hope is to create a more and more friction less ability to create transactions which effectively benefits commerce and hopefully creates more revenue opportunities for us.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.
Great. Thank you.

We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2014 earnings call.
Before we jump into my usual remarks, I'd like to bring two points to everybody's attention. First, a reminder that on April 2nd, we issued our Class C stock dividend with twice as many shares outstanding, our usual per share information will look quite different starting this quarter.
Also, second, and also as a reminder, our expected sale of the Motorola business -- mobile business to Lenovo triggered discontinued operations accounting treatment which means Motorola's quarterly results are shown separately from Google net income. You'll see this new presentation in our financials starting this quarter.
So with these two caveats noted let's dive into the details of Google's financial performance in Q1. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year to $15.4 billion and it was down 2% quarter-over-quarter.
Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would in fact have been 21% year-over-year. Google sites revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $10.5 billion and was down 1% quarter-over-quarter driven by the strength in our core search advertising business.
Network revenue was up 4% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was down 4% quarter-over--quarter driven by improved year-over-year growth from our Ad Exchange and AdMob businesses.
Finally, Google's other revenue grew 48% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and was down 6% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play Store drove year-over-year growth. Chromecast sales were also strong.
Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter again up 26% year-over-year and down just 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost per click was down 9% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter.
Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. Our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by a number of factors discussed on previous calls, including geographic mix, device mix, property mix as well as products and policy changes.
And to help investors better understand the complex dynamics of these monetization metrics, we'll begin disclosing paid clicks and CPC growth by property in Q2.
To be clear this means we'll disclose CPC and paid click growth rates for both our sites and network businesses. We will continue to disclose aggregate growth rates for CPC and paid clicks.
Turning to the geographic performance, we saw strong performance in the U.S. and rest of world, solid performance in our U.K. In our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor Relations' website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world, to show the impact of FX and benefits from our hedging program. So, please refer to those slides for the exact calculation.
U.S. revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $6.7 billion, the U.K. was up 14% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and in fixed FX terms, it grew 11% year-over-year.
Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 25% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. This accounted for 47% of our total revenue, which includes a $8 million benefit from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of world grew, in fact, 30% year-over-year.
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.2 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.6 billion in Q1, excluding our stock-based compensation.
Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.6 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation and as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5 billion and our non-GAAP operating margins were 32% in Q1.
Just a quick word on a few items that may have created noise in our operating expenses this quarter. We had some discrete legal expenses that hit our G&A line as well as one-time M&A related costs that increased our operating expenses, particularly in R&D. So, absent these discrete items, our expenses continue to demonstrate the same disciplined agenda we've always had.
Headcount was up, roughly 2,100 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 50,000 full-time employees and please note that the headcount still includes approximately 3,700 full-time employees from the Motorola business as well as the employees from the acquisition completed in this quarter.
Our effective tax rate was 18% in Q1 and our tax rate this quarter was impacted obviously by the federal R&D credits, which expired in 2013.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $357 million for the quarter and realized gains on investments and interest income, offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. For more details on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $4.4 billion. CapEx for the quarter was 2.3 billion this quarter; again the majority of CapEx was related to data center construction, production equipment, and real estate purchases.
As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest in the long-term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area of investment for us. Our free cash flow was $2 billion for Q1.
And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. Motorola had a great quarter in Q1 with the Moto G showing strong sales momentum especially in emerging markets. The team continues to be hard at work and we look forward to seeing them join up with Lenovo soon.
So, there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities including Android, Chrome, YouTube, enterprise just to name a few.
And now I'll cover more details -- I'll let Nikesh, in fact, cover more details of our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. Here you go Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. You're welcome to cover more details if you'd like.
Our business is growing well, with $15.4 billion in gross revenue; we had a particularly good advertising performance in the United States, highlighted by very strong auto sector showing around the Super Bowl. We had strong Play growth in Asia and we had a few isolated tracks.
By now you're aware of the four areas driving our business. The first one direct sponsor, or as I like to call it performance marketing; the second one helping clients build their brands; third our ad tech platform for publishers and agencies; and fourth, our emerging businesses like digital content, enterprise, and hardware.
Let me give you an you an update on all of those and talk about industry trends that are driving the investments we're making. On performance advertising, people are now always online and they want seamless, easy experience as they move from screen-to-screen.
This constant connectivity is driving our investments here as people use search to navigate their world, Google is well-positioned to help people navigate between web, apps and the places around them. They help the marketers measure the entire customer journey and to drive better monetization.
Next week, we'll be welcoming hundreds of advertisers to our adverse performance forum where we'll talk more about our work in this area for marketers. But clients are already benefiting from our recent investments like enhanced campaign and estimated total conversion.
For instance, Shutterfly recently began measuring cross device conversion networks to understand sales that start in one device and end on another. As a result, they saw 60% increase in mobile conversions for non-brand terms, leaving them to include 100% of their keywords on mobile devices.
We're seeing great momentum in product listing adds as well, with a new shop in campaign system. International retailer Farfetch upgraded shopping campaigns and increased their conversion rate by 13% while reducing cost there per acquisition or CPA by 20%.
And Domino's Pizza -- who doesn't like pizza, recently made it easy for customers to pay with Google Wallet, instant buy in their in Android app.
Moving on to brand building. For years you've all seen the rise of digital video, over-the-top networks, connected screens, streaming devices and high quality digital programming. Already for example, YouTube reaches more than 1 billion people a month through usually popular channels like fashion guru, Bethany Mota; cooking maven, Rosanna Pansino; and cult hit Nerdist.
For marketers this is an irresistible trend, and we're now at a significant industry moment. Marketers and agencies that have historically built their brand on TV are reorienting their creative, planning, and investments with digital at the center.
This year nearly all Super Bowl advertisers turned to YouTube to extend the life and reaches of their TV spots and Super Bowl related ads on YouTube have been viewed over 300 million times. That's roughly three times the size of the audience that watch the ads on TV.
In Australia, we work with Nissan to create made for YouTube video for the launch of their new Patrol SUV. The campaign which is promoted by TrueView ads and YouTube mass set for over 340% increase of daily visits to their websites, and more than 2% of those were interactive for the campaign booked a test drive.
In a few weeks in New York at our annual Brandcast Upfront Event we'll focus on our new Google preferred offering. This features exclusive access to the best, most engaging content on YouTube with guaranteed audiences through third-party measurement providers, Neilson and Counselor. We're really excited about this and we're looking forward to the results of that Upfront Brandcast Event.
We're also helping brands through our newest display ad formats. We recently teamed with Tory Burch to bring her New York Fashion Week Show to a global audience across our display network. Then also the first ever live stream of fashion show in an ad using a light box ads, and we're able to share the exclusive event with more than 7 million of their biggest fans.
Third, moving to our ad technologies and platforms; our programmatic ad technologies are seeing -- are continue to see great momentum with premium publisher partners like The Local Media Consortium.
That's comprised more than 800 daily newspapers and 200 local broadcast stations as well as timing. Both of them signed on with us in February to create private exchanges. This maximizes a value of that ad space for handpicked premium environment.
One thing we know is that agencies and publishers want to trust the environment in which they're transacting. Our ad network and exchanges are widely regarded across the industry as having the best quality controls and we continue to invest here.
In February we acquired wellium fraud fighter Spider.io and thousands of our clients are already using our MRC-accredited Active View technology to buy high-quality viewable ad impressions.
Let me switch over to our emerging new businesses, digital content, hardware and enterprise. Google Play continues to be the thriving hub of our digital content business. This quarter we introduced Google Play movies to 39 new countries, so now people in more than 65 countries can enjoy movies through Play.
We also teamed up with Sonos to bring high-fidelity play music into the home and we introduce new development tools for Google Play games including game gifting and iOS multiplayer support.
Over 75 million new users joined Google Play games in last six months; all of this is helping turn developers around the world into full-fledged businesses. In fact, we paid out more than four times as much money to developers in 2013 compared to 2012.
And following the Open Automotive Alliance that we announced with partners in January designed to bring android as a car, in March we've announced Android Wear, a project that extends android to wearables.
We're also already working with several consumer electronics manufacturers, chip makers and fashion brands who can't wait to see what developers come up with for your wrist.
We also continue to see strong momentum from our suite of hardware products, our $35 Chromecast is a real hit. Last month we brought Chromecast to 11 more countries. We also recently opened up Chromecast developers, and in just a few weeks, more than 3,000 developers worldwide sign up to bring their apps and websites to the platform.
Turning over to enterprise. We continue to see strong product adoption around the globe. We launched Chromebox for meetings, which makes it easy for any company to have high-definition video meetings through the power of Google+ Hangouts and Google apps.
We're also investing significantly in the Google cloud platform and I've seen a very positive response to our most recent product announcements.
We expect to see continued momentum in this area and we believe we can bring significant value to the many companies that opting public cloud because of our experience in building and operating one of the world's largest cloud computing environments for over a decade.
We able to pass on the savings that come from lower digital storage cost to our customers through highly competitive pricing. In addition, every day more businesses, governments and schools start using Google apps to work better together including the state of Sao Paulo who moved to Google apps for more than 4 million students and 300,000 teachers and staff.
Before I close, I want to call out our marketing team who continues to highlight the magic of Google to beep around the world, into fourth annual Google Science Fair, the doodle for Google in United States, the hugely popular ad campaigns.
They also helped to build great retail experience for Chromecast in over 6,000 stores. I'd like to thank all Googlers around the world who help makes a terrific quarter.
I'll now hand over back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. So we'll work with Jamie to go straight to the Q&A. Jamie?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
Patrick, I was wondering if you could help us quantify some of the expenses you saw, the one-time nature of G&A and anything else there that was really one-time. Just to help us understand what that run rate would look like if that wasn't in there?
And then maybe the cash, if you could talk about the theme of sort of advertising attribution and how that's going to help you potentially bring over more brand dollars, and how do you think about bringing over those television dollars.
I mean is that something that's going to come sort of a big rushing in 2014, or it's just going to be a slow evolution over many years. Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Great. Thanks Ben. When I start, look on the discrete legal expense that impacted, it really impacted our G&A if -- and then the one-time M&A deal cost impacted all of our operating lines, but most prominently our R&D line, which you'll notice will have jumped a bit.
The one-time M&A deal costs are largely stemming from the Nest deal, which was a pretty large transaction for us this quarter, but I think that the best way to describe it is that our expenses in Q1, they are completely in line with our objectives if you'd kind of take apart these two items, so that's how I would describe it. Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
In terms of brand benefit Ben, I think -- thank you Patrick, thank you Ben. The brand question is a very good question. What we've noticed in the past let's just say 1.5 year is that people have slowly started coming to the digital medium to create extensional the existing brand campaigns like I mentioned the Super Bowl ad. People come to YouTube and say I'd like to read certain audiences which are only available on digital medium hence we see those advertising dollars shifting as an enhancing existing television or media campaigns.
Now the real fun will began when people start doing campaigns exclusively on digital to go and help them build brands. That requires us to get ahead of the curve and get into the creative process much earlier because usually what we end up doing now is we get up -- we get to the end of the period of process and they just want to extend their brand.
So we're working really hard to work with creative ad agencies, the large agency groups as well as our advertisers say how can we get ahead of that creative process, how can we help you conceive of brand campaigns that actually start and end in digital where perhaps you use TV as an extension medium as oppose to the other way around.
Now I think this is definitely the Holy Grail. This is going to take us a level of time to get there, but with things like attribution in place with our deals with Nielsen and comScore we're beginning to create the compatibility saying look the same dollar you spend on television equates to so many dollars on digital or vice versa.
The fact that we can give them sort of cross media measurement capability, we can give them comfort that their dollars are being well spent, even spent in digital. We will go long way in making sure that we get them to transition from just using traditional media to including digital in their media mix and eventually designing campaigns that start and end up digital.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. Jamie, let's go to our next question. Thank you, Ben for your question.
Operator
And we'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two things I wanted to ask. First, Patrick, just on the U.S. you had commented on the strength here in terms of 14% year-over-year, but it does look like on a sequential basis we saw a little bit more of a DeSale have been in recent 1Qs. Can you just comment if there's any factors there to point out.
And then Nikesh, can you just talk about the key drivers of mobile pricing going forward. How you think the gap can close with desktop over the coming quarters and years. Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
All right. Thanks for -- Doug, for your questions. So in the case of the U.S. if you think about it you have the Q4 to Q1 issues that are typical. And then, as we've said before, the network business does skew toward the U.S. on a relative basis, so network clearly grew slower than site.
So that's what really what you see is that mix of the two, but in aggregate, right, pretty pleased with the U.S. growth overall. So that was a pretty strong quarter. I'm really happy with it. Well, let Nikesh answer the mobile questions.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, Doug, I think thank you again for the question. I've had firm belief and I continue to hold on to it that I believe in the medium to long term. Mobile pricing has to be better than desktop pricing. And I think the reason -- the way to think about it is that in mobile you have location and you have context of individuals which you don't have on the desktop.
And the more you known about the user and their context, the more effective advertising you can provide to them. The better the conversion is likely to be for a search or any piece of advertising that you do. There's a whole bunch of building blocks that need to come into play for us like you said to get the gap to close.
The good news is a lot of people are spending a lot of time on mobile devices. There's a lot of mobile search queries that we get. People are more and more focused about what they look for in mobile devices. They are closer to intent. They are closer to transaction.
You see that there's a lot of friction-less ways of paying and converting transactions into commerce which is happening but things like instant buy etcetera. You're also seeing the lot of advertisers seemed through value of making sure that their present and a great experience on the mobile devices.
So part of our challenge has been that if you guys just huge massive advertise in the desktop which over the last decade have become better at advertising, Understanding, optimization, understanding conversion, understanding truncation.
That journey is just beginning for advertisers in the mobile site. They're just beginning to understand what it takes for the end user to come transact on their website.
So like right now we can leave the horse to the water, we can't make it drink. But with all the advertisers coming on-board and working with us, we are actually begging to show them real transactions and asset beings to gain traction. I think we begin to see that gap continue to converge.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Thanks you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks Doug for your question. Jamie let's go to the next question.
Operator
I'm going to go to next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Great. Thanks guys. I had a question on the Google Play App Store revenues and Nikesh you just mentioned that you guys paid out 300% more revenue to developers in ’13 versus ’12.
So, I guess, how much is Play contributing to the overall licensing and other line, and there is clearly some lines or some items in that line that are not growing nearly as fast to get to the current 48% average. So can you talk about maybe what's underperforming in that area?
And then last question on this topic is, I think if you go back to the infamous Andy Rubin slides from the Oracle case, the revenue share was around 5% for Google Play App Store revenue share, where is that now and is it changing as the Android ecosystem gets larger?
Patrick Pichette
Thanks. So why don’t I take a shot at this. Ross, the – if you think of our other revenue estimates for this quarter, right – first of all its – we’re really delighted by the Play business. So – and you’ll remember that a year ago we had – I mean, I'm going to bring back everybody to Q1 of 2013.
We had a lot of Nexus 4 hardware sales, because we were in stock out in Q4. And that in combination with the accounting change of our Play app content revenue recognition. Again, remember till Q1 of last year both just simply created a bit of tougher year-over-year comp for this quarter, but overall very pleased with all of the kind of big lines of growth in this space.
As for the rev share, I mean, obviously, this accounting change kind of goes to this 30% rather than the what you would have seen before which would have the net and – but we don’t divulge with the percentages are, that we keep going forward.
So that’s basically where we stand on it and that’s why we are pretty pleased with this line for this quarter.
Nikesh Arora
And if I can add to Patrick, I think, the important part is, it’s taken us a while to get all the capabilities in place around the world in different markets, making sure we have all the content we need, we have all the app providers we need as well as the we have the payment mechanism. So, we really are excited about the Google Play business going forward.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Great. Thanks guys.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks. Thanks, Ross. Jamie lets go to our next question.
Operator
And we will go next to Mark May with Citi.
Mark May - Citigroup
Thanks. A question regarding the CPC segmentation for next quarter. Why you may not be in a position to provide these specific data points for Q1. I was hoping that maybe you could give us directionally how CPCs have trended between the owned and network businesses and kind of what are your expectation is going forward? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
So, Mark, you will get the information in Q2. What we really wanted to do with the recognition as we think about giving more transparency to our shareholders, just looking at having exactly as you just mentioned the split between kind of our core sites and then the network itself.
I think it will be useful for everybody and then, obviously, we will have the information going forward.
So a lot of insights are going to come out of that and we are very pleased to be able to share with you starting next quarter. We've just made this decision over the last little while and shared it with the Audit Committee, the Board, so just stay tuned for next quarter on it.
Mark May - Citigroup
There are number of dynamics that play into the blended CPC that you've called out before property, policy, geo and device among others. Once you provide this new layer of transparency, does that really capture the major -- is it really the property and maybe to some degree policy differences that are influencing CPCs between owned and network or will geo and devices continue to play a major role in reported CPC, even once you provide this extra segmentation?
Patrick Pichette
Well, they all will and if we do – we may change just the policies that effect network, you will see them much more in transparent way. So in that sense it’s a very positive kind of news.
Whether devices kind of have effects on network versus others, you will – it will be much more difficult to see. But, clearly, the impacts that are driven specifically for network or for sites you will be able to see on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So I think that’s good news for our investors.
All right. Thank you so much for your question, Mark. Jamie, why don’t we go to our next question, please?
Operator
And we will go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks. Two questions on the U.K. revenue growth at 11% number and on the partner websites at 4%, is there anything you would want to call out that has been unusual drags on those growth rates? I think U.K. is the lowest we've seen and maybe just lot of large numbers and really successful execution of that market. But anything you want to call out for either of those two revenue streams. Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Well, as I said, well let me start with the U.K. The U.K., look, combination of partner mix this quarter, as well as, again, year-over-year matters a lot and we have happen to have a year ago a real revenue favorable weather.
I mean, people kind of tend to forget it, but last year we had a very strong Q1 for the U.K. and the combination of these two things just kind of year-over-year made the comparison a little tighter for this quarter.
As it relates to websites – partner websites, I covered that a bit earlier. And we’re – I mean, again, you back to last year where network, if you think about Ad Exchange, that model change in that model continues to be very, very strong.
And we will remember again last year that we started the DLA policy change in Q1 or maybe it was in Q4, but the impact of the DLA actually takes time to flow through.
We said that would take multi quarters. So, this has not kind of float over completely. So what you have again there is very strong on the quarters where we want sort of the Ad Exchange and AdMob, but on the flipside of that, right, you still have the tails of the DLA change policy that’s for a year ago. But the effects have not fully flowed through, so even in the coming quarters you should see a bit of an effect there, but, overall, pretty pleased with actually these results, Mark.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. Jamie, let’s go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we go next to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
Thank you. I have two questions. First, in the last eight quarters headcount has grown significantly slower than revenue, but this quarter you hired, I think, 2,300 people in the core and headcount grew its revenues. Was this change in hiring rate mostly because of acquisitions and marginally what prevents you from hiring 2,300 people a quarter or even more as the business grows?
And secondly, Patrick, in the spirit of giving more transparency to shareholders, can you give us some color on what has driven such a sustained increase in CapEx over the last four quarters?
Because, I – I think clearly it’s not just some lumpy behavior. Are you buying data center sites in advance of demand and if this is the case can we infer that CapEx will revert to historical levels. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Carlos for both of these questions. So, to the headcount question, I think, you've basically nailed it intuitively, which is, the acquisition of Nest – the acquisitions this quarter had a quite a bit of people impact on this number. Or kind of if you think of our organic numbers, have actually not changed in any material way.
So it just happened, you know, you buy Nest and it comes with a lot of people. We also had, you remember, the acquisition of DeepMind and few others. So for us we had the double hitter of having the opportunity to continue to attract people on an organic basis to our processes and these few acquisitions kind of moved the needle quite a bit for us this quarter.
As it relates to CapEx, listen, you are right that we – and I've mentioned this in the last couple of quarters, where we have – and just a reminder to everybody, if you think of the CapEx categories, right, data centers first, and data construction then production equipment then all other facilities, it’s kind of like the hierarchy of needs.
And in the case of data center construction, we have found that the option value of having more capacity on standby and available to us to grow versus not having it is actually a real strategy issue for the company and in that sense if for whatever reason we continue – we had a spike in demand that was really pronounced and sustained for a couple of quarters and we did not have the capacity, it would be a real issue strategically for us, relative to the quite low cost of having the infrastructure in place.
So that’s why we’re really pushing ahead of the curve and so it’s with this view of long-term. So from that perspective you are also right that that’s the mindset we are applying and we've always said that CapEx was lumpy, so you have a good manifestation of it right now, right here. So thank you for you those two questions, Carlos.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse
Hey, thanks guys. So, Nikesh, so in order to attract greater brand advertising dollars, it seems like safety and context are also important factors, because you are certainly not falling short on reads.
So how close do you think you are to either engineering or coming up with some sort of solution to contextualize all the video content on YouTube, so you can guarantee you advertisers brand safety? Thanks
Nikesh Arora
That’s a good question. I think as I alluded to, we are going to do an upfront in a few weeks in New York City called Google Preferred, which is sort of our way of trying to create a premium sort of concentration of content that we can have advertisers advertise against which gives them a higher level of brand safety, a better level of measurement and hopefully plays where they believe that they can actually build the brands and hopefully that will – that will manifest itself in our ability to have a premium compared to what we can attract to the market without providing those kinds of things. So that’s a very good question. I think that’s what we are hoping to achieve and stay tuned for our detailed announcement of Brandcast.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse

And we’ll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. I have three quick things. Did Enhanced Campaigns which you rolled out over the summer, impact Q4 and do you see some more benefits coming this year?
Second, on PLAs, we think you had very good success in the U.S. in Q4, did that – does that, do you still have some benefits to come from that as you roll that out in Europe. How are you looking at the timing there versus how you rolled that out in the U.S.?
And finally in the first quarter, maybe you can call out some specific verticals that might have strong or weak for you. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora
That’s a good question, Justin. Thank you. Not sure I can give you a lot of detail in terms of precise impacts of any individual products that we have. But, Enhanced Campaigns are working. It’s a necessity that we have to do them both for process reasons as well as the reason that consumers are going from screen to screen as well as advertisers need to advertise across multiple screens.
So from that perspective Enhanced Campaigns is working, it’s part of life here. We don’t do anything without Enhanced Campaigns across the board. It’s sort of gone from being Enhanced Campaigns to regular campaigns because we don’t have any unenhanced campaigns anymore.
In terms of PLAs, it’s something, as I alluded, is actually working. It’s providing a lot of color in the shopping vertical. It’s providing a lot of hold in shopping campaign effort that we have. PLA is working for us and its sort of working from multiple perspectives.
It is providing users the detailed information that they need when they are declaring intent and saying and I would like to search for particular product, please don’t send to me to website.
So it is working. We are going to roll that out one, separate time around the world. I cannot comment on the timing exactly. But I think both of those things are having a positive impact in our minds to everything we are doing around here.
Patrick Pichette
Just to close on this, just a few verticals here. I mean, again, completely reflecting the economy around us. If you go to – automobile has been quite strong across the world. Travel, actually quite strong in the U.S., so in the U.K. as well as in the rest of the world, a little bit less in the U.S, but just to give you a sense of. And then real estate, clearly, in the U.S. has been a strong vertical as well as in the U.K, so, again, a good reflection of the economy there, Justin.
So, Google Trends, I always encourage people to go and checkout Google Trends as well because they continue to give good insights as to what's going on in the economy which would mirror in terms of verticals.

Eric Sheridan - UBS
Thanks for taking the question guys. So two ones. One for Nikesh. Nikesh, I would love to get your view on sort of your view of the travel industry. Sort of how are you approaching that industry as a participant from an economy basis in that industry, both the marketing funnel and potentially the booking funnel? Longer term there’s been a lot sort of written lately about the way in which you guys might approach that industry vertical.
And then second, Patrick for you. Maybe taking a stab at the one-time expenses from a different approach, when we look at the model, if you take your comments before about sort of smoothing out the expenses we saw in the back part of the year and even year-over-year, it appears that one-time expenses might have been about 50 basis point to 100 basis point impact on each of those two lines which would have sort of brought the blended number back up to sort of somewhere between 75 basis point to 150 basis points on margins. But just want to take a stab at that from a different direction just to quantify it. Thanks guys.
Nikesh Arora
Thanks Eric. That’s for the question. I was actually talking about pulling up the article which recently -- were Darren Huston talked about the effectiveness of Google Advertising for price line. I think that’s a public endorsement that all our efforts in the last many years in rather travel industry are actually working.
They see tremendous value in our ability to help them bring more travelers to their sites and for them to help convert them into a real transaction. So whatever we are doing is working.
I think I am expecting – suspecting that the comments we are talking about is our continued efforts in providing more and more detailed information when people do searches. And as we've talked in the past before that people’s information needs are getting more precise and we have to keep evolving the results at Google, whether its knowledge cards or Google Now all the things that we do towards giving them more and more precise answers, in which case sometimes we are required to go work with various industries to get the underlying data to surface it when the users are looking as opposed to send them to other sites where they have to go through that search process again.
So I think you can expect us to continue do that. But our intent there is to provide a better answer for the users, whether it’s on their desktop or mobile devices. Accordingly, we also working together with the advertisers to provide them various advertising opportunities which allow them to work effectively with the end-user and provide them the answers that they are looking for or perhaps in this case the ticket or the hotel booking that they are looking for.
Patrick Pichette
Great. And then on my side, Eric, look, as I said in my earlier comment, our Q1 expenses were completely in line with our objectives and there is always seasonality.
As you've noticed, from Q4 to Q1 there is always – we spend less on marketing and so that’s true for this year as well. And for the other areas, right, we would have been in line with the objectives we've set for ourselves. So these one-time costs were genuinely and that’s where truly one-time.
And – I mean, when you acquire Nest for bit over $3 billion, there is just a lot of stuff that flows through the P&L, lot of accounting, and so that’s really the issue there. So, I would go back to your instinct of at least kind of we should be roughly in line with what our expectations where and they – that’s why the nature of truly extraordinary items. So thanks for that question.

And we will go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Why don’t you revisit attributions for a moment? Given aspects attribution and I think you guys are doing a great job on the cross screen attribution and taking advantage of your ubiquitous login across different platforms and Enhanced Campaigns.
Wanted to get a better understanding of how you’re thinking about online versus offline attribution for those types of marketers, particularly brand advertisers, supermarket advertisers, the 30,000 SKUs and those retail channels that don’t have E-Commerce and really don’t have much of the search opportunity. How are you helping them close the gap between their online activity and offline sales? Thanks very much.
Nikesh Arora
Thanks Peter. Thanks again for the question. I think as you rightfully pointed out the attribution story on the advertising side is kind of becoming clearer as we partner with Nielsen and comScore, and adopted some of the mechanisms that traditional media has used to create the comparability between traditional and internet media.
I think you identity a good challenge which is that how do we bridge the gap between online commerce and offline commerce and relate that to advertising opportunity, i.e. when we sell search, we sell traffic to different people, how do we convince them, how do we make them realize that that traffic that they’ve got normally results in online sales, but also results in offline sales at stores and how do we encourage that activity.
So over the last many years around the world we have run specific studies, working with various advertisers which are called online to store studies where we actually try and measure what online activity created by them took to control group's results in more foot traffic in their particular stores and certain reasons about. And we've pretty much had very good results across the board.
I can't detail specifics right now because they are all specific to individual advertisers who we work with. But we do understand that opportunity and the problem and we work specifically with third-party research teams to work on figuring out how do we keep showing the online to store efficacy. And there are other products as you can see where we start doing conversion, we start looking at things like Google Shopping which also helps us in those areas.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks again, Peter.
Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities
Thanks for the color.
Patrick Pichette
Jamie, let’s go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we will go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to go back to an earlier question there was – you responded about the building blocks that were needed in order to get mobile pricing, mobile CPCs to convert to desktop.
I was just wondering if you could share with us kind of specifically what you think those building blocks are that need to happen over the medium to long-term as you said to see that conversions occur. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora
Of course, thanks Heather for the question. I mean, look, there were some very simple things and there are some complicated things. The simple things are, we will make sure that there is payment enablement for users.
So i.e. users have a mechanism that allows them to pay with lowest amount of friction, because honestly you and I don’t want to spend our lives trying to enter payment information on a very small screen where you are trying to conduct the transaction. So that enablement is happening across the industry, across multiple payment platforms.
There is also the need that when people search for some things they can get quickly down to the information and they don’t have to browse multiple sites, because people are more keen on declaring intent to mobile devices than going and searching multiple websites and trying to figure out what they are trying to do.
And that intent could be in the form of restaurant, could be in the form of a taxi, could be in the form of them looking for individual product. And you are beginning to see apps, you are beginning to see solutions on search that allow you to get to that granularity of information.
Of course, there is a big building block which is getting all the people out there which shows the advertisers effectively in this case the merchants who actually have to have experience in the mobile site which are simpler to execute on.
So try buying something on many companies’ mobile websites and it's more own risk than their desktop sites because they've been spending a decade trying to optimize the desktop site, but they haven’t spent enough time optimizing mobile experience, in some cases not believing that people want to transact with them in a mobile device and some cases they are just slow and they are just slowly diverting resources from desktop to mobile.
So, if you take all those things and take the notion that we need to keep sort of working hard towards getting these building blocks in place, I think there's a finite time where these building blocks will come into plays.
And as they keep coming into plays, you will see or as we talked about earlier, perhaps the conversion will happen between pricing in mobile desktop. But there's a whole bunch of other issues, I think but those are the big things that we need to think of right there.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks so much.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question Heather. Jamie let's go to our next question please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.
Great thanks. I wanted to ask you a question on the cloud platform. Since this is obviously a huge revenue opportunity for you and first-off if you could put context around the impact of this business on CapEx and OpEx, particularly on the infrastructure of the service part of the business?
And then secondly, if you could talk about how you're planning to differentiate the service, is it really about pricing or is it by tying in the software and platform as a service offering, if you could touch on that? Thanks very much.
Patrick Pichette
I can cover the first part and then I'll let Nikesh cover the second. Look we're very comfortable with our cost structure. In light of Google efficiencies, economies of scale, our vertical integration from data center to chip -- to servers, to software. I mean we really have -- we believe we have absolute unique position from a cost structure perspective and therefore, from a margin perspective makes us very, very comfortable.
In terms of differentiation, I'll just let Nikesh jump in here.
Nikesh Arora
I think Colin -- thank you again for the question. The important part to at least acknowledge in the space of cloud computing is we think that it's very, very, very early days. I mean if you think about the potential scope and scale of what this opportunity is, that's pretty much every business which is going to be around for the long-term has to operate in the cloud.
There's no efficiency compared to the efficiency of the cloud, but in compared to owning your own infrastructure running it by yourself. So, this shift is going to happen. It’s a matter of every company going through that shift one at a time. And if you look at the opportunities out there and the options, there's very few options.
So, there's a lot of room for all of us to have a great time for many, many, many years before we start worrying about differentiation and why my sort of thing is better than yours.
So, right now, the key is to be able to work with the companies out there, the enterprise customers out there to get them to shift on the legacy systems, get on to the cloud and realize that Google has been working in the cloud for more than a decade, because we have been running one of the largest cloud computing platforms in the world in the public space. And we have all of the expertise and skills that are required to be able to serve these enterprises and get them off their current legacy system onto the cloud.
So, our effort is really trying to work with each of these third-party partners, trying to get them off the legacy systems onto our cloud. I don't think the challenge right now is the need to differentiate. I think our biggest differentiator is we have the most experience in the space.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.
Great. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks Colin. Jamie we'll go to our next question please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jordan Monahan with Morgan Stanley.
Jordan Monahan - Morgan Stanley
Hi, thank you for taking the question. Actually two if I may. A couple of big picture questions, I think for Nikesh. The first is I think there's an ongoing debate about whether mobile web or mobile app is going to win and what the implications are for various businesses, Google included?
And I'm just curious to get your view on whether you think one will win over the other and then whether it matters for Google?
And then the second is when you look at Google's share of global advertising, you're coming up on about 10% of total, but when you look at your business in the U.K., you're north of 20% of total.
So, when you think about your global businesses as economies start to mature, do you think the U.K. is a fair proxy for thinking about your business globally or are there other factors that you think may prevent you from getting to that type of scale globally.
Nikesh Arora
I guess let me answer the second question first Jordan, because I'm standing here Patrick is looking at me asking the same question. I think the way to think about it is that we have 10% by some metric depending on what we believe the total is.
As per your metric, we have 10% of the total advertising sort of money. And the U.K. we have 20%. That just tells me there's 90% more opportunity around the world and 80% more opportunity in the U.K.
So, we're not going to constrain our thinking in terms of what believe is a stable state. Our aspiration is to be able to serve every advertiser in the long-term and our aspiration is that -- our hope is that every piece of advertising becomes digital advertising.
The question is how much of that are we able to provide through our technology platforms, how much are we able to provide through our own sort of properties and how much do we partner with others to provide on their network.
So, I guess I'm trying to tell you we don't constrain ourselves and our thinking. I'm not trying to be arrogant, say we want 100%, but we like more than what we have in every market out there.
In terms of your question around the mobile web and mobile search, that is a tough question and that is a very involved question and I think the approach -- the best way to think about it is that we're trying to make sure we can make both of them effective for the end-user and make them both work, because we're not about to try and pick winners.
Right now, you can see that people spend as much time on mobile devices -- more time mobile devices they are beginning to spend on the desktop and they are spending the time across the mobile web as well as mobile app landscape.
We're participating in both those ecosystems, whether it's somewhere placed on the app front, whether it's through our browser-based search properties or through our app-based search properties. So, we're participating across the Board and I think at the end of the day, it's going to boil down to ease-of-use and consumer choice.
Jordan Monahan - Morgan Stanley
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jordan. Let's go to our next question please Jamie.
Operator
And we'll go next to Robert Peck with SunTrust.
Robert Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions if you don't mind. The first is on the revenue side, can you talk a little bit -- can you maybe give us an update about the breakout of YouTube versus DoubleClick revenues, where are those today and where could they be over time?
And then on the cost side, Patrick could you just walk us through just how you think about the ROI on capital? We get a lot of questions from investors asking about spending, could you maybe tell us more about the thought process and how the company looks at the ROIC of capital going forward? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Okay, well Robert, let's start with the last one first and then we'll go back to revenue. ROI clearly we have -- we always look at capital intensity. The fact that we're investing quite a bit in CapEx right now is a real tribute to kind of the potential and the optimism we have about our businesses going forward.
Most of our core businesses if you think of YouTube or advertising or search are not that capital-intensive relative to other areas that we have such as for example, Google Fiber, if you think of the access portion right which is much more traditional CapEx.
For each of these areas, we actually track and make sure that we have good returns and we have a capital efficient. So even though an area that take the advertising business that we run, even though you could argue that it's phenomenally good on return on capital, the questions that we will ask internally is okay so if the utilization rate is X on our machines on this business, right, why can't it be X plus something?
So, even though we have already good return on capital in these areas, we continue to always push the envelope to make sure that our capital efficiency continues to be better and better on a year-to-year basis and then across a portfolio, every area has some capital kind of targets to make sure that we're driving for value.
Finally, there's a number of areas if you think of take the newer stuff like Loon, for example. In those cases, you test through the hurdles that we kind of we seed capital to the Loon team as they hid their hurdles and they kind of earned their right to the next cost for funding.
And in doing so, right, we continue to always have the business case in mind that says here is why this continues to make sense to fund and invest and with an ROIC or value in mind for the long-term, but in the short-term, it's really kind of delivery of milestones on very specific engineers objectives that actually gives them the next round of funding.
So, Robert as you can see, given the portfolio of mature stuff we have and growing areas as well as kind of much more R&D and innovation at the early stages, right, we just need to have a basket of tools to actually manage the concept of ROIC or ROI on each of them. And that's what we do. It's not rocket science; it just requires a lot of discipline on our part.
On the revenue side, look, we don't break out DoubleClick or YouTube. I can just tell you as I mentioned a bit earlier; we're really pleased with our network revenue in the kind of AdMob, AdExchange. Many of our areas continue to grow very well and we're very, very pleased by these investments and clearly continue to be very pleased with YouTube as mentioned -- Nikesh mentioned a bit earlier.
Robert Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Thank you very much.
Patrick Pichette
That's the story there. Thank you. Jamie, we'll take one last question. We're running out of time. So, we'll take one last question if you don't mind.
Operator
And our final question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffrey.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Hey, good afternoon. Another question regarding trends and mobile CPC. Yesterday you announced an offline conversion tracking plan and program with Datalogic. Is that something potentially the whole online to offline tracking that could have a positive impact on CPCs? And separately any updates on how you think about Fiber longer term? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Okay, so why don't I take the last portion and then Nikesh may have views on this data conversion plan.
On Fiber look, you've heard our announcement earlier this quarter where we're working with 34 cities and looking for working with these municipalities, they've indicated to us they are really excited about, they kind of self-selected to be really excited about getting Fiber and the next generation of access.
So, right now, we're basically working directly with them to look if we have the right conditions to actually go to the next stage which would be the build. So, very excited about it. I think that it's a really good sign of things to come in access in general.
I think that everybody now in the industry is talking about the gig. It's becoming the standard and we're absolutely thrilled for all of the users out there that can think in one day they will get a gigabit of symmetrical internet at reasonable price. So, stay tuned on the next part of the chapter, but really excited to work with these communities. And Nikesh maybe you want to talk about--?
Nikesh Arora
Yeah. Thank you, Gene. I mean as I mentioned earlier and the question earlier from -- I think it was Heather that the online to offline conversions are really important opportunity where it's important for offline merchants to be able to understand what results they get from their online activity.
And some of the experiments that we talked about required partnerships of third-party data providers to understand how that happens and I think Datalogic is one of those things, which we're looking out to see how we can help quantify the opportunity and quantify the answer for our offline partners. It's just one of those things that we're doing.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Great. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Gene. Just in closing before I hand it over to Jamie, just to reiterate the point that Nikesh made a bit earlier to all of our Googlers out there and all of our partners out there, thank you so much for the great work in Q1. What a great start to the year and then we'll see you in Q2. So thanks. Jamie I'll leave it with you to close the call please.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Google Inc. Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Jane Penner, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jane Penner
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google’s fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With us now are Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.
Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations page for the latest Company news and update, please check it out. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect the results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and restructuring. We’ve also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon everyone. It’s Patrick and you may remember we mentioned last quarter that Larry will no longer be joining us on a regular basis on this call as he focuses his energy on running the Company. But consistent with our prior calls, Nikesh and I will be here. We will cover the performance as well as answer any questions you have about the business, including significant ad product launches or other developments and in the case that you have a very, very detailed product related question, in some cases we may simply take it off line with you. But with that why don’t we just dive into the details of our financial performance for Q4.
Our gross total consolidated revenue for the quarter was $16.9 billion and the overall business was up 17% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google segment, gross revenue grew a healthy 22% year-over-year to $15.7 billion and was up 14% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, the Google segment revenue growth would have been 23% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter.
Our Google sites revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $10.6 billion and was up 12% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the strength of our core search advertising business. Network revenue was up 3% year-over-year at $3.5 billion and was up 12% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven in part by each year year-over-year comparisons as we anniversary some of our ad policy changes implemented at the end of 2012. But we also saw improved year-over-year growth from our ad exchange.
Finally, Google’s other revenue grew 99%, almost doubled year-over-year to $1.6 billion and it was up 34% quarter-over-quarter. The digital sales of apps and content in our Play store drove the year-over-year growth in this line as did hardware sales and the Play hardware sales drove most – a big chunk of the quarter-over-quarter growth.
Turning to Motorola segment, gross revenue was $1.2 billion. As we announced yesterday Lenovo plans to acquire our Motorola business for approximately $2.9 billion. This is great news for Motorola and the Android ecosystem. And as Larry noted in our press release, Lenovo will have the expertise and the track record to scale Motorola Mobility into a major player within the Android ecosystem.
Coming back to our Google segment, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 31% year-over-year, and up 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 11% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter. And please note that currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q4 on the cost-per-click.
Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors discussed on previous calls, including FX, geographic mix, platform mix, property mix as well as product and policy changes.
Turning to geographic performance of our Google segment, we saw improved performance in the U.S. and the U.K. and strong performance in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of the world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
U.S. revenue was up 16% year-over-year to $6.9 billion. The U.K. was up 15% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, which includes a small $2 million benefit from our hedging program. So currency fluctuation had minimal impact on U.K. revenues in Q4. Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 30% year-over-year to $7.3 billion. And this accounted for 46% of our total revenue, which included again a very small benefit from our hedging program, in fixed FX terms; the rest of world grew a strong 33% year-over-year.
So let’s come back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $4 billion in Q4 excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.8 billion again excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. And our non-GAAP operating profit was $4.8 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 29%.
For our Google segments, specifically our traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenue. The other cost of revenue was $2.8 billion excluding $127 million of stock-based compensation. And our Google segment operating expenses were $4.3 billion, again excluding SBC of $746 million.
Depreciation and amortization expenses on property, plant and equipment for the Google segment was $660 million this quarter. And Google segment profitability was $5.3 billion in Q4, resulting in a Google segment operating margin of 34%.
At Motorola, our total segment operating expenses including cost of revenue were $1.6 billion, excluding $29 million of SBC and $15 million of restructuring charges to Motorola. Keep in mind that intangible amortization expenses attributed to Google segment and Motorola segment are included in these segment measures.
Of the $279 million in consolidated intangible amortization expense this quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola of which $116 million was allocated to Google and $37 million was allocated to the Motorola segment. As a result, the operating loss for the Motorola segment was $384 million in Q4 and the operating margin for that segment was negative 31%.
Our headcount for the consolidated business was up roughly 1,300 people in Q4. The Google segment added 1,700 people during the quarter and in total the consolidated company ended the quarter with approximately 48,000 full-time employees. Our effective tax rate was 16% in Q4. Tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continuing mix shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
Let me now turn to cash management. Our OI&E was 125 million for the quarter. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense from our hedging program. For more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.2 billion. CapEx for the quarter was 2.3 billion and this quarter the majority of our CapEx spend was related to production equipment, data center construction and real estate purchases.
As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest for the long term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area for us to invest. Our free cash flow, in consequence of all this, was $3 billion. So there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Enterprise just to name a few.
Before I wrap up, I want to cover two quick things. First, I want to remind everybody as I do every time at this time of year that as we start a new year, things such as employer taxes, 401(k) and all these other related accruals tend to be frontloaded in the year. So please consider this as you model your forecast.
And second, before I hand it off to Nikesh, I want to give an update on our issuance of Class C shares. Our Board of Directors has formally approved the Class C dividend and has set March 27 as the record date and April 2 of this year as the issuance date. So we expect that Class C shares to begin trading on April 3.
We were excited to announce that the Class C shares will actually trade under our original Ticker, that is GOOG, while the Class A shares will trade under a new Ticker GOOGL. We're setting up a link on our Investor Relations site so that it can give you more information on the Class C dividends.
With that, I'll let Nikesh cover the details of our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. So, here you go, Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned, our business had a strong quarter with $15.7 billion in Google segment gross revenue. Overall performance was strong in retail and automotive and CPG sectors. We had particularly good growth in Asia Pacific including its various emerging countries as well as in Southern Europe.
I want to talk about three areas that are fueling growth for Google and our clients. First, our continued efforts to help performance marketers reach customers and drive action across screens. Second, our continued progress in brand advertising. And third, our ad technology platforms used by thousands of agencies and publishers. Then I'll say a few words about new areas like digital content, hardware and enterprise.
On performance; performance advertising continues to be a mainstay of our core business. We're seeing good growth. It's driven primarily by increased search activity across all screens. It's driven by new measurement features and more sophisticated marketers are aligning their search and display advertising strategy.
Last year we made the move to Enhanced Campaigns in AdWords, 12-months in marketers tell us it helps them get results and reach people across screens in a big way. Our internal slogan for this is 'Advertisers ROIs don't lie.' We also rolled out estimated total conversion. Marketers can now measure results like calls and conversions that take place in different devices.
For example, 1-800-Flowers discovered a 7% increase in overall conversions when they figured out that conversions that start on one device then end on the other. This is a great example of our vision as it relates to the seamless multi-screen marketing and something that was impetus for us to launch in ad campaigns.
In the holiday season, one thing has become very clear. The Web has truly become the new holiday store window. It's first where people go and it's where everyone gets excited about holiday shopping. In the U.S., Walmart continues to use Google search more and more. They are investing with us more than ever before to drive sales during the holiday season.
There's also great momentum in product listing ads and we continue to improve the experience for shoppers and retailers. Last quarter, Google Shopping came to eight more countries. We even helped deliver products to your doorstep in just a few hours. Google Shopping Express, our same day delivery service, has been open to shoppers in the Bay area since last year. I'm very pleased with the feedback we've gotten from our partners and users.
Now moving on to brand marketing. Working closer and closer with brand advertisers has been a big priority for us and we're making great strides. Now you might have seen all the teaser ads running on YouTube ahead of the big game Sunday. Given my personal passion for cricket and lack of, pretty much any knowledge of American Football, I decided to turn to Google Trends and see who is leading. I see that Seahawks have more searches than the Bronco, so that's my bet for the Super Bowl. But folks in Denver better get searching if they want the Broncos to win.
I don't know what that means for the big game on Sunday, but I do know that we are becoming a central to the biggest brand-building campaigns of the world. There are three big areas of focus that brand and our agency partners really like. First, building our great content on YouTube. YouTube gives brands amazing reach and a passion of unique audience you can't get elsewhere. YouTube has over 1 billion viewers per month and saw a 50% increase in daily watch time last year.
Second, the best digital marketing captivates people when it's by the Web, for the Web. It's so much more than simply taking television ads and transplanting them on YouTube. So we're investing in creative ad formats that pivot around user engagement like CUview or engagement ads across the Web. Last year for the first time, three videos by brand marketers were on YouTube's list of top 10 videos for 2013.
Third and importantly, better measurement than enables brand and agencies to measure and optimize campaigns based on metrics like reach, recall or awareness. Last quarter we enabled advertisers in our Google Display Network start buying ads based on viewable impressions, a fancy way of saying, ads that people actually saw. In November we began testing Nielsen OCR, measurement on our YouTube and our network. There's a lot more to come here, but it's an important step to helping brands invest online.
We think our efforts are really resonating with major clients and agencies from around the world. Our sales team continues to fire on all cylinders. I'm really pleased we hired Kirk Perry as our President of Brand Solutions from Procter & Gamble. His goal is to help the largest brand and agencies in the world embrace digital marketing more and more. He speaks their language, so we hope that he'll be able to convince them that the future for brands is truly digital.
We worked with Kraft to build a series of engagement ads, showcasing brand videos, recipes and coupons for its new Fresh Take brand. That campaign was very successful and left an impressive 2.9% engagement rate in that average engagement time of 48 seconds.
Moving on to our ad technologies platforms, our DoubleClick buying tools continue to be the choice for agencies around the world, and we're really benefiting from the growth and programmatic spend. One trend we're seeing is the move towards private ad exchanges in which a premium publisher uses our technology to make ad space available to a small number of handpicked, high quality and highly qualified advertisers. This could provide a very safe, real-time environment for both brands and publishers.
The volume of compression running through our private exchanges as on average doubled every quarter over the past year. Overall, our monetization solutions like our Ad Exchange, AdSense and AdMob are helping major publishers maximize their revenues from digital advertisers. So that's our core ad business.
Let's talk about our trisect of emerging new businesses; Google Play, hardware and enterprise. Google Play continues to win the hearts and minds of people, the latest books, newspapers and magazines, 20 million songs, thousands of movies, textbooks, all access music. You can live your lives on Google Play. People love it so far. This quarter we introduced a Google Play Newsstand that brings together more than 2,000 free and paid news sources including newspapers like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times. We also introduced Google Play for education. It's a design for schools and educator proved ads as well as tools to easily set up a classroom of tablets in minutes.
We have a strong holiday season for our growing suite of hardware products. One of the things that has done really well for us is Chromecast. It continues to be a living room favorite remaining a best selling product throughout the entire quarter. We’ve also been adding to the growing list of content available through Chromecast with new supported apps like Hulu plus, HBO Go and Pandora, with more to come.
Chromebooks are also seeing great momentum with eight of the top manufactures of computers now making Chromebooks, including new devices from both Dell and Toshiba. One in four devices sold into K-12 education in the U.S. use a Chromebook according to FutureSource. We’ve also been seeing strong momentum in Nexus hardware with great reception for Nexus 5’s. And as cars become more connected we’ve recently themed up with the automotive and technology leaders Audi, GM, Honda, Hyundai and NVIDIA to form the Open Automotive Alliance.
Our enterprise business continues to grow steadily as more businesses than ever want their employees to work the way they live. We’re seeing great momentum in the retail space. There is supermarket Waitrose, the clothing retailers Chico’s and the fashion accessory brand Fossil have all gone Google this quarter. On the cloud platform side we announced that Google computer engine is now generally available supporting additional operating systems at new lower prices.
But before I close, I also want to give a shout out to our marketing team in particular they had really helped to drive the success of Google Play and the hardware products over the holidays. They have been able to do that through great effective advertising and creating awesome retail environments. And of course, thanks to all the Googlers and our partners for helping us to have a terrific quarter. We are not just embracing the future; we’re helping to shape it. With that, I’ll hand it over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you Nikesh. So, Jamie we’ll look for your instructions to open the lines and get on to the Q&A please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
Thank you. Two quick questions, Patrick, if you took your five or six major geographies for search and for each of them you plotted separately the evolution of CPCs for mobile and for PCs and Tablets, and you look at these curves from 5,000 feet, would they be mostly going up, down, flat or all over the place. And secondly, could you let us know if Google Compute Engine and Google App Engine are significant drivers of CapEx, 5% or more of your CapEx? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
All right, so let me jump by the second one first, Compute Engine - most of our CapEx right now is really driven by data center construction and machines that are actually driving both the core businesses of Google and of course App Engine, but App Engine I wouldn’t describe as any of the core areas where we’re seeing a ton of growth, not that App Engine is not successful; it's just when you compare it to search or other elements that kind of use a lot more capacity. 
In the case of your first question, it's very clear that we don’t usually breakdown each of these geographies. But the fundamental trends are happening across the web, and in the same way. So all this issue of some markets are growing much faster which is the emerging markets, so you could see that -- you can infer that from our results obviously.
Clearly there’s a shift between all those platforms whether it be Mobile, Tablet and Desktop again across the world, so you can infer that as well. Our sites versus network. The U.S. is a strong network area, everybody knows that and so, you can basically kind of from your own inference kind of pick and part these kind of elements, but they together move to actually really make the ecosystem vibrant and growing. And at the end of the day what you have to, just how did you say it? ROI’s don’t lie, Nikesh? So, I mean at the end of the day that’s what you’re pleased about. You’re pleased about great results for our users that get them exactly the right answer they’re looking for and great answers for advertisers. So, that’s how we actually you should think about it, Carlos. Thank you for your question. Let’s go to our next question, Jamie.
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Mark May with Citi. And Mr. May if you would check your mute button. At this time we cannot hear you.
Patrick Pichette
Why don’t we go to the next question and then Mark can show back up.
Operator
Thank you. We’ll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Jordan Monahan - Morgan Stanley
Great, thank you. It's actually Jordan for Scott. I guess two quick questions, the first is you didn’t talk much about Nest and so we were curious whether you were primarily interested in their design team or product or something else. And then on the other revenue line what was the contribution to the other revenue line from Chromebooks or Chrome otherwise in the enterprise?
Patrick Pichette
All right, thank you for your questions, Scott. In the case of Nest, look Nest and Google share a real common vision. Nest, both of us believe that technology should be doing the hard works so that people can get on with their lives and do great things. So our goal is really in the case of Nest is to help them scale. And bringing the resources of Google to increase their investments, reach broader audiences and then scale internationally. So, for us it's a terrific opportunity and then bring people like -- being able to attract people like Tony and Matt to the team is actually wonderful. So, that’s really the context of Nest.
Your second question; let me just go back to your second question. The other revenue line. Well actually as I mentioned in my comments, the other revenue it really grew well, like just under a 100% year-over-year. If you look year-over-year the biggest contribution was actually on the Play apps and content. But quarter-over-quarter because of seasonality obviously it’s hardware, but it's both the combination of Nexus 5 which was very strong for us and the Chromecast.
You got to remember that most of the Chromebooks are actually sold to other parties. So we’re really a facilitator rather than, and so we don’t book revenue on the Chromebooks. So that’s really the puzzle, Scott. Thank you for your question. Why don’t we go to the next question, please?
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities
Hi, great, thanks for taking the question. Nikesh, I just want to ask you about YouTube in particular. If you could help us understand the growth that you’re seeing in terms of YouTube advertising revenue? And then secondly just on Nielsen OCR tagging, if you could give us some early market or feedback in terms of what you’re seeing there and then a little bit more color on your decision to go with outside measurement rather than how you’ve been doing it internally? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, sure. Look, I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, YouTube is one of our core advertising business, so both Search and YouTube are doing well for us around the world. It is part of a broader shift where we’re seeing brand marketers and if you saw us, as I said our strength this quarter was not just from retail or automotive also from CPG. And part of our ability to get CPG customers to come and advertise with us is our ability to convince them that brands can be built on the Internet and YouTube clearly is the key player in our brand story, vis-à-vis advertisers, because they still think visually -- they still video when they think brand advertising not just text ads.
So I think YouTube is definitely a key part of our brand story, and it continues to do well. I think our teams around the world have sort of figured out how to pitch YouTube to large customers and customers are paying attention. So I think YouTube continues to do well in addition to our core Search business and people are seeing the value of YouTube vis-à-vis brands. 
In terms of the OCR tagging and our decision to do it internally versus externally I think look in the long-term what advertisers want is a third party to endorse various media.
It's very hard for us to be a media owner to be the person providing measurement against our own media. At the same time we believe there is tremendous amount of development that can be done in the space of measurement where traditional measurement has been both sort of after the fact and also has been on the very limited set of parameters. We believe we as a team can not only increase the parameters that you can measure due to the digital world we also believe that you can look at different metrics simultaneously in the dynamic way and also create new metrics for the future.
So our metrics efforts internally have been focused towards creating future metrics as well as more dynamic metrics as opposed to passive or legacy metrics. But that’s work that we continue to do. We continue to work with third party, parties outside including Nielsen and other players of the industry, because we believe that’s where the measurement industry needs to go, and eventually we have to work with them to get them to evolve with us in that direction.
In terms of the early feedback on Nielsen OCR tagging, I think it's sort of like, it's table stakes you have to have Nielsen OCR or some metric that is common across various media in the market for you to be, for advertisers to be able to measure your effectiveness or your relevancies vis-à-vis somebody else. And so I think what we’ve done, this is just early table stakes which is sort of a comfort factor for advertisers, when they see that they can look at Nielsen OCR metrics vis-à-vis us and other people and get a sense that they are not spending their money in an unwise fashion, but I think there’s tremendous amounts of evolution and development that’s going to happen in this space.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities
Great. Thanks, Nikesh.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Nikesh. Jamie, why don’t we go to the next question?
Operator
And we’ll take a question from Mark May with Citi.
Mark May - Citigroup
I apologize about earlier. A question around Google Play; I believe today in just the App business and Mobile App business in general for Google I believe today you don’t do a lot in a way of app marketing, for instance, Map - app install type advertising. First, is that true? If so, is that an opportunity for Google? And then secondly, it seems like that there is a lot of discussion in the market and dollars being put against identity-based ad targeting in addition to or in lieu of cookie-based advertising. What are your thoughts on that? And how is Google, if you think that's a positive trend, how is Google taking advantage of those new forms of ad targeting?
Nikesh Arora
Thanks, Mark. This is Nikesh. In terms of your first question in the area of app install, yes, clearly it has become a larger market recently with this whole mobility factor where everybody is trying to get more and more mobile. We have solutions. We have always had solutions as part of our AdMob product as well as our AdSense products where advertisers can use those forms of advertising towards creating app installs. And we continue to work hard to see where else in our various portfolio of services we can introduce the idea of app install. So you'll hear more from us in that area in the future. But I think you're right. This is an opportunity and we continue to work hard towards making this opportunity real, not just with our existing products but also looking at other ways that we can keep driving this. 
In terms of your question around cookies and alternatives for cookies, I think it's fair to say that there is a lot of conversation around cookies, there is a lot of stuff going on in terms of how do we continue to evolve this area of technology and make sure that we give the users more control and also make sure that users have security in terms of what data gets transferred for them right and increase the transparency. So, our teams are working on this. There are some early concepts in our teams where they're trying to see how they can – we can evolve this notion in all three parameters that I mentioned. But I think it's too early to talk about what those precise solutions are likely to be.
Mark May - Citigroup
Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question. Jamie, let's go to the next question please.
Operator
We'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital Inc.
Yes, a few question on the Google Wallet initiatives. One, could you just talk about generally what are the problems that that group is trying to solve? Two, can you just tell us a little bit more about the structure of Google Wallet? Who runs the group, who do they report to? And then when you're talking about the number of credit cards that you actually already have in that system, can you give us any – can you help understand the quantity there? Are you measuring in hundreds of millions, tens of millions? And then separately, Nikesh, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on initiatives to improve ad attribution and measurement and specifically measuring sort of the online to offline attribution? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you very much for those questions. I think – let me start with Google Wallet. I think the best way to think about what Google Wallet is trying to achieve is we're constantly trying to reduce the friction from somebody still doing a search to trying to actually acquire something. But then that is going from online to online, from online to mobile, from mobile to mobile or even online to offline like you referred to in your question at the end. So, the hope of our team is to make sure we reduce the friction and of course create a higher degree of security and comfort vis-à-vis the end user so they get a better experience. Now, Google Wallet is actually a team that is run by our commerce team, which works with Sridhar, who works with Larry. And I think the best way to think about is as people go more and more mobile, we're noticing a lot more people are spending time buying apps and digital content on their mobile devices and they end up signing for Google Wallet as part of their Google Play experience. So, we are seeing lot's more – lots and lots of users use those services. I leave it to you to infer how many Android users there are and how many Google Play users there are and what proportion of them as buying goods and services from us. So that gives you a sense of Google Wallet. It's definitely a number that we are very happy with and it continues to grow.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question, Ben. Ben, this is a complex question. You can always refer back to the IR team for more details on this stuff. Jamie, why don't we go to our next question please?
Operator
We'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. A couple of things. We are seeing rest of world revenues accelerate. Does that have any benefit from product listing ads or some of the mobile changes you made in the platform? And maybe you could talk about how those are going? And then sales and marketing went up quite a bit in Q4. I was just wondering if that was related to Motorola. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So why don't I take the second one and then I'll let Nikesh talk about the PLA. Sales and marketing in Q4 was actually just really tied to the holiday season. We had great momentum of the Nexus 5 and the Chromecast. And so at that time of the year we decided when we have such winner products, we would actually support them in addition to a number of other areas where we actually invest. So very, very pleased with the performance of both of those as well as Chromebooks, which have been, if you look in the press, the feedback you get is number one, number two in so many markets. So very, very pleased of actually kind of making that investment in these core products. For the PLA, I'll turn it over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Hi, Justin. Yes, to break your question down in terms of – there are two or three parts to your question. I think in terms of the growth in the rest of the world, effectively the growth we're seeing in the rest of the world is actually on our core search advertising business and it's across the board. It's across our various products. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done a lot of work in Enhanced Campaigns and trying to drive solutions from a multi-screen perspective. What we're really seeing is not a particular screen or a particular format, it's actually something which is allowing advertisers to come in and say, hey, I'd like to acquire more customers, I'd like more people on my website, I'd like more people in my store. And effectively them spending money and us helping them optimize across multiple screens how that money should be effectively spent and them measuring the ROIs and saying, this is good, I need to spend more money in this space. So, it's not a particular change in our mobile platform or any other platform, it's actually really our move towards Enhanced Campaigns, which is helping us and the strength in our core business. Vis-à-vis product listing ads, we've talked about this a few quarters ago how we are moving from 10 blue links in certain categories to more entity-level results. And product listing ads is a prime example of how it's happening effectively. We are seeing adoption. As I mentioned, we've added eight more countries this quarter. So, this is part of a continued evolution and it is adding value to both our end users, shoppers as well as store retailers. So it's clearly giving us benefit, our users benefit and obviously more relevant results, allowing merchants to reach specific audiences.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question, Justin. Jamie, we'll go to our next question please.

Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse
Hi, guys. So I've always thought of Motorola as an asset for Google to push the agenda for both hardware and software innovation to the OEMs. So, how does the sale to Lenovo affect your ability to do that? Also was your ownership with Motorola ever an impediment to having a closer working relationship with any of the other OEMs before? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Well, the short answer is we believe that this is a great transaction where everybody wins. I think that Motorola will find in the mature handset a terrific partner and we'll provide scale and continued really momentum on what is now done very well, which is develop world-class product. In addition to that, Motorola – let's never forget right has really strengthened our Android ecosystem and done a terrific job on that. So I think that both from a perspective of the hardware itself in the handset area as well as for the core Android ecosystem, I think that it's a real win-win for everybody. In addition to that, right, as you know from the Nest acquisition and Glass and Wearables, we continue to innovate and we continue to be committed to the hardware in areas that are kind of enterprising, promising, new frontiers and that's where actually we're focusing on. So I think all in all, quite a great story.
Thank you so much, Stephen, for your question. Let's go to our next question, Jamie.
Operator
We'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric Sheridan - UBS
Thanks for taking the question. I guess a broader question, the long term around your e-commerce initiatives, just understanding how you envision continuing to partner more deeply with offline retailers, how PLAs play into that and maybe an update on what you've seen early days from the Google Shopping initiative in San Francisco and now it seems to have expanded into a second market? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora
I think the best way to think about it is that what is happening is over time, people are looking – when they look on the Web, they look for more and more bite-sized [ph] answers and which was the genesis of why we believe that entry level search begins to make more and more sense whether it's in travel, whether it's in hotels, whether it's in product listings, people are looking for more specific answers. And as you get mobile, you want even more bite-sized answers so that people can get the information as quickly as they want. So that sort of is the genesis of product listing ads. If you take that to its logical conclusion, that is people declaring intent that they would like something and that gives you a sense and a signal that, okay, clearly if they're looking for something, they're more than likely wanting to buy it at some point in time. So, we see our role as trying to enable the entire ecosystem across the board of retailers both online and offline to be able to provide those goods and services directly to the end user as quickly as possible with the least amount of friction. And friction comes in their ability to find it. Friction comes in their ability once they've found it to buy it. That's why things like InstaBuy exist in Google Wallet where you can have instant purchasing capability. And then of course there is the notion of gratification or once you've bought it, I want it as quickly as I can get it. So, you can see that our product initiatives are sort of triangulated across all of these things whether it's PLAs in terms of your ability to find it, whether it's payment capabilities to try and close the loop or whether it's delivery, experiments where we see how can we get it to you as soon as possible. So it's more of an open system approach. To be fair where we can help the entire ecosystem and our various partners and you can see that our teams are working really hard towards enabling this vision, but it takes time and great execution.

And we’ll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Good afternoon. You’ve talked in the past about enhanced campaigns as being the most significant change to AdWords since its inception and can you give us little bit of context to -- its been rolled out for six months now, is it fully up and running, are advertisers fully embraced or at what period you think that we’re going to kind of hit its stride with enhanced campaigns? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora
Hi, Gene. Yes of course. Actually it’s been an year since we started talking about enhanced campaigns. And we’re very happy with the progress. It’s fully embraced, it’s fully up and running across around the world. Our thousand and thousands of sales people around the world are trained. Our customers and advertising partners have understood that, that’s the way for them to go target audiences and users and really focus in ROI metrics.
As we talked about, we will launch the notion of estimated total conversion, so we can look at -- let people think about it during the multi screen way, because more and more we’re seeing that people do not distinguish the activities they conduct in one screen. So earlier we said that people usually search in their desktop and in their mobile devices when they’re mobile, they do different things. But we’re noticing that across any screen you get a sense of pretty much the same activity that happens, which means that advertiser should be somewhat agnostic on where they’re able to reach the user, they should want to reach the user wherever they’re. So our thesis has been proven right.
Advertisers are embracing it, users are exhibiting those behavioral patterns, so it’s provided honestly tremendous amounts of efficiency in our ability because we don’t need specialist in various screens, various technologies to kind of work with advertisers. We can have one team work with this product which our product teams have created, which makes it very, very simple and people can look at the ROIs again from spending money with us or individual economy as opposed to having to break it down in silos that doesn’t need to happen. So it’s been very successful. We are happy with it. It’s in its full stride and the effects that you don’t see is the effects we see internally in the amount of efficiency and clarity and our ability to work with advertisers and then being able to measure their ROI effectively.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Do you think it could have kind of an increasing positive impact going forward or are we kind of seen its full impact in the December quarter?
Nikesh Arora
I think the way to think about it is that if you haven’t done something like this, our lives should have been extremely complex and you might have seen us de-accelerate because we would have get -- gotten sort of tripped up in our own floating. And we wouldn’t want to do that because we’d have to explain why one screen works better than the other screen, how is the ROI from one compared to the other. And you create an artificial differentiation or distinction which doesn’t need to exist because at the end it’ about users, advertisers and publishers.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray

And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Thanks, guys. Just a question on, I guess, product or strategy for mobile. You guys are working on assisting users in mobile, not just answering search queries with hyperlinks as you did during the kind of PC browser era. Yet most of the data suggests that mobile users are spending pretty much all their time, summing around in apps all day. So how do you envision Google improving the mobile experience and how do you envision Google potentially controlling a purchase funnel if we stay in apps all day like you controlled it in the PC era? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Let me jump in just sort of a very high level and Ross I think that the fundamental tenant is rather than to speak about mobile and only mobile. It’s really living with the user. And once you think through living with the user, supporting our users across all their day, whether it would be on a TV, whether it would be on a mobile phone, whether it would be on the desktop, whether it would be on with Google Glass wearables, that’s really the aim that we’re actually shooting for. And if on -- if it happens that on mobile they spend some of their time on apps, right, that’s just one portion of the puzzle.
But when you’re looking for the question, the answer and actually getting you to the real assist across your day, not then just what the devices you’re on, what’s your question or what should we assist you. I think it’s the real question to answer and I think that’s a much broader and a much richer set of the opportunities for us rather than just to be cornered into one. So I kind of defend the premise of your argument, because I think it’s -- I mean our agenda is so much richer and so much more exciting for us, when you think about it in the way we just did it. So that’s the way to think about it. Thanks for your question nonetheless. Let’s go to our next question please, Jamie.

And we’ll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities
Thank you. I have two. First on local advertising, I'm curious about Google Maps, Google Ways. Monetization of local, our geotargeting based products helping local advertisers to drive ROI and what you guys need to do to drive that business in terms of advertising real-time locally? Then the second question, maybe for you, Nikesh, you mentioned the NFL jokingly, I wonder with the growth of YouTube as a platform when you look at the birth and the growth of Chromecast, why is it that you wouldn't find professional content or sports content strategic or useful in terms of driving the next leg or era of growth and monetization for YouTube? Thanks very much.
Nikesh Arora
Let me answer two different parts of it. First is, in terms of your question on local monetization. So, I think we’re clearly experimenting with new ad formats in Google Maps. But I think there is a broader way of thinking about local. It’s not just about app, it’s about location. And as the world begins to interact across multiple screens, you begin to look at location in a whole different way because you’ve a better understanding of where users are and how you can use that as a filter to provide them more precise information and hopefully, much more relevant advertising, which requires both ends of the spectrum. It requires us to understand the users’ location, but also requires the advertisers to make sure they give us the location of where their services are best utilized.
So we need location extensions from advertisers, we need locations from users, and we have to be able to marry them across not just Google Maps, but all across pretty much every experience that we’ve, whether it’s search, whether it’s anything, whether it’s YouTube, whatever service that the end-user is using, we’ve to be able to localize it, because location is a great filter and allows us to make things more relevant both from advertising and from an organic perspective. In terms of YouTube, I think we are very happy with the growth that YouTube is having and has had both from a user perspective as well as content provider perspective and as well as from monetization perspective.
In terms of content providers, we talk to content providers, large and small across the entire spectrum, because we want you to use the platform where creators of any size can build an audience. They can build an audience of scale; fans can find the content that they want. It’s hard to comment on a particular piece of content because it starts a whole season of conversations. But we’d welcome any content on YouTube as long as people felt that it would add value to the end users and as long as there is a right economic model associated with it.

Hi. This is Kevin on for Mark. Just wondering, are you guys seeing Nielsen OCR measurement pushing more brand advertisers towards YouTube?
Nikesh Arora
Thanks, Mark. Sorry, this is Kevin. Sorry. Thanks, Kevin. Kevin, as I mentioned earlier, we had a long spirited answer on measurement. We’re seeing measurement as, table stakes for brand advertisers because they want to understand what is the return of their brand spend. Now it’s easier in performance advertising because you can see the number of clicks you get in your website or you can measure the number of people who walk into your store.
On brand it’s a different metrics. We want to actually try and understand how many people were you able to reach of a certain age, certain gender and that’s what Nielsen OCR allows you to do. It allows you to compare it across the various brand media. So its sort of access table stakes and as I said earlier, it is the early set of metrics that are sort of basic entry metrics into this space.
But we hope that this market is going to evolve from a measurement perspective over the coming quarters and coming years where we can have more sophisticated metrics and metrics that actually allow you to see the impact of this advertising on your brand.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks. Let’s go to our next question please, Jamie.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Richard Kramer with Arete Research.
Richard Kramer - Arete Research
Thanks very much. Patrick, you’ve talked before about projects like Google Fiber needing to make returns and you see acquisitions like Nest getting replaced by disposals like Motorola. And you’ve now passed the $50 billion mark in terms of net cash. So do you have any plans this year to address this sort of mounting cash pile and as a part of the Google business that that needs to generate returns like the other businesses? And then for Nikesh, you surely seen the various social network and messaging peers absorb some substantial volumes of advertising spend. How does that make you think about the evolution of Google+ and YouTube and some of the other social platforms you have as a complement to the search based business? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
So, I will jump on the first one. As I’ve reiterated many times before and we were with our Board yesterday at the Audit Committee reviewing this issue, and so it clearly -- the cash position of Google is seen as a strategic asset. It is an important asset to us both in terms of offensive and defensive, given the world in which we live in. And in that context, it's been reviewed regularly and we make sure that actually we get the best return for our investors on that asset as well. So, we have a real strategy for that as well. So, for now we have nothing else to announce on it but just to give comfort to our investors that we do take this issue seriously and it is reviewed on a regular basis by both ourselves, management, but also raised to the Board for the right answer. So, thanks for the question. Thanks for asking. It is always there. I'll turn it over to Nikesh for the second part of the question.
Nikesh Arora
Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Richard. Let's see – yes, I guess your point, yes, there are other people who are beginning to absorb some amounts of digital ad spend. I think the $15.7 billion for this quarter was a majority of this being advertising, I still think we have a substantial advertising spend coming into us. But again, from a longer term perspective, I think every piece of advertising becomes digital. So, we're still at single – I think at low double digit numbers in terms of how much ad spend is digital versus non-digital. So we need more people in the digital space getting more and more advertising to shift from what we call traditional old media. I think over time television becomes digital, I think every piece of advertising becomes digital because this provides so much efficiency from a measurement perspective and a targeting perspective to take out a lot of waste out of the system. So, with that in mind, I think we're still in the very early days of how much advertising is going to move over to digital media. And I think you're right to identify that, places like Google+, places like YouTube are still very, very sort of in their infancy in the amount of advertising they can support vis-à-vis the amount of usage we're getting. So we continue to work hard. We have to strike the right balance between user services, end user service and the amount of advertising we have presented them, because this continues to be sort of evolving space and what you don't want to do is you don't want to overrun users with tremendous amounts of advertising, because that maybe good in the short term but creates a bad experience with users in the long term. So, you will notice that many of our products still do not have tremendous amounts of advertising because we still believe those products are evolving and the right form of advertising just hasn't been invented for those particular areas. So, we remain hopeful in the long term for finding more and more ways of enabling advertising for users. And for sure, perhaps some of the products may not lend themselves to advertising and users will prefer to pay for an ad-less product as it relates to certain areas like applications or digital content, et cetera. So, those models also exist out there. So I think there is tremendous amounts of scope in the future and I think you have rightly identified some of the areas where we should be concentrating.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question. Let's go to our next question please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could share with us your strategy to try and reduce fragmentation of Android. And is the sale of Motorola a potential catalyst for this to start to happen? And ultimately, do you think this even matters over the long term? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Well, again, Heather, certainly the transaction with Motorola continues to support the ecosystem. So in that sense, right, I think that we have clear objectives of support. We've always had clear objectives to support all of our partners. And after this transaction, it's very clear that we'll continue to be kind of this impartial supporter of the entire ecosystem. As it relates to the detailed fragmentation, we've taken a number of steps. We've talked a lot about this already in the past. There is a number of steps taken to make sure that in fact there isn't fragmentation and I'll just encourage you to kind of circle back to both of what's written as well as circle back to the IR team for more of the details. But we've done a lot of progress already on this over the last kind of 18 months and a lot more to come. So thanks for your question.
We have time for one more, so why don't we jump, Jamie, to the last question of the afternoon.
Operator
We'll take our last question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.
Great. Thanks. Just a question on enterprise. Obviously, from a SaaS perspective you already have a very good business. But in terms of the infrastructure and platform services, can you talk about how you're approaching the go-to-market? Whether it's based on pricing since there are low margin competitors already in the market or is this more of a broader platform approach to link the services together? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Colin, for your question. I'm still trying to parse your question. Look, I think we've done really well from an enterprise perspective. We are steadily growing revenues on our traditional Google apps business. Outside of that on the platform service, the Google Compute Engine, Google App Engine stuff, we continue to make progress. I think we should – we have more room to work harder over there. We understand there are other players out there, but again that is such an early, early stage in that market. We think over the long term, almost every business out there, existing and new, has to be on a cloud platform, has to be on a large scale industrial strength infrastructure platform and there is still few players out there and there's lots and lots of room. So I'm not sure if price is the current factor on which people need to make a decision. People will make a decision based on robustness, based on security, based on availability, based on the breadth of services we can offer in that platform and I just think its early days. So, we should be working on all those things and you should be hearing more from us in the future.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for that. So, in closing, a couple of points. One is, welcome to 2014 everyone. Having closed down 2013, we're totally excited by this coming year. And just as Nikesh had said at the very beginning, thank you for the people in the financial community for your support as well as to our Googlers, partners, I mean the amazing people that make our job, Nikesh and my job so easy to be on this call because of their superstar performances across all of our products and our markets. So, again, congrats to the Googlers for a great 2013.
With that, Jamie, I'll let you close the call.

Good day everyone and welcome to the Google Inc. Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Ms. Jane Penner, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.
Jane Penner

A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

We’ve also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Page
Thank you. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Google had another strong quarter with $14.9 billion in revenue and great product progress. We are closing in our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device.
Research has shown that people tend to overestimate the impact of technology in the short-term, yet underestimate the scale of change longer term. For years everyone talked about the multi screen world. Now it’s arrived, but on a scale few imagined, people increasingly have more than one device and screens are proliferating in the home as well as wearable screens like watches and Google Glass.
When android was still a (indiscernible) project I used to feel kind of guilty visiting the team. We are a search company and building a new operating system wasn’t an obvious move to most people. It turns out that was a lot of (indiscernible) over 1 billion android devices have now been activated worldwide and 1.5 million devices are led off everyday.
I’m also tremendously excited about Chromebooks, which are growing fast and defining the more general decline in laptops. It’s like the chrome browser; updates are seamless and frequent improving security and usability. It was a great example of technology doing the hard work, so you can get all the stuff that matters.
Two weeks ago we launched the new HP Chromebook 11. Its beautifully designed and light weight and just over 2 pounds and at $279, highly affordable. Best of all, it has a high power micro USB charger that can also charge your android phone. Recharging isn’t too much of a sweat and there is tremendous potential to innovate. So it’s great to see progress here.
This quarter we also launched the Moto X. The first one that Motorola has developed and produced since Google acquired the company. Super fast and clean and the voice features are great. While it’s still early days, Dennis and the team have already transformed Motorola’s product quality. Now they’re working to build out marketing and distribution.
As screens multiply people navigate across them seamlessly becomes more and more important. That’s why I love Chromecast which we launched in July and immediately became a best seller. On your phone, tablet or laptop and start playing some music from Youtube or a show from Google play or Netflix. One click the content is there on the bigger screen in your home, your TV, all for just $35.
And unlike some other streaming devices, you can continue to email search and share as the Chromecast handles the hard work without draining your device battery, genuine multi-tasking in a multi screen world. We’ve also making great progress across devices with Youtube. Almost 40% of Youtube’s traffic now comes from mobile, up from 6% two years ago. And in August we updated our Youtube apps for android and iOS. You can now leave a video playing at the bottom of your screen while you explore other content.
Our execution in velocity and search from maps is getting better and better and from a very high base. A new map app for iOS and android shipped in July, but is specifically for downloads to make the most of this larger screens. And in September we’ve rebuilt our entire mobile search experience of a simple card interface that is easy to read and have designed, that is optimized for touch.
Our momentum on voice search is tremendous. We added four new languages this quarter making available on over 78 languages and accents. We’ve also expanded the quick answers, we can provide just for you. Fast Google for your flight details and up here instantly in your search results, no digging around in your email required. And the search across Google+ photos is extraordinary. Search for sunsets and all the pictures you've ever taken of sunsets to appear instantly. If you haven't tried it, prepare to be amazed.
About two years ago, when I became CEO again, my goal was to ensure that Google maintains the passion and soul of a start-up as we grow. It's why I've worked so hard to increase the velocity and execution. So we create great products people love to use and iterate fast to ensure they get better and better. Because great is just never good enough.
When you look across the company, it's amazing how well the teams are executing. For example, we rolled out Enhanced Campaigns in AdWords across all devices for all our advertisers in less than a year. Of course none of this would happen without great people and we are so lucky that we have them. I'd like to thank all the Googlers and Motorolans who make everything possible. Keep up that velocity and execution.
Before I hand over to Patrick, I want to let you know that going forward, I won't be joining every earnings call. Patrick and Nikesh do a great job covering our business each quarter and they'll continue to do that great work. I know you all would love to have me on, but you are also depending on me to ruthlessly prioritize my time for the benefit of the business. I'm very confident you are in good hands with Patrick and Nikesh.
So now, over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us again. Without further ado why don't we just dive into the details of Google's financial performance in Q3? So here we go. Our gross consolidated revenue was just shy of $15 billion at $14.9 billion. The overall business was up 6% quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year.
Our Google segment, gross revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year to $13.8 billion and was up 5% quarter-over-quarter without currency fluctuations, Google segment revenue would have actually grown 21% year-over-year and the currency impact on sequential growth was actually immaterial in our case this quarter.
Google sites revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $9.4 billion and was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the strength in our core search advertising business. The advertising policy decisions that we implemented earlier this year to ensure good user experience continued to negatively impact Google's network revenue in the short term, and therefore our network revenue was in fact flat year-over-year to $3.1 billion and was down 1% quarter-over-quarter.
Despite the short-term pressures we continue to believe that this is clearly the right answer for our users and shareholders in the long term. And finally to finish Google's segment on a positive note, Google's other revenue grew 85% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and was up 18% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play store drove year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in this line.
Turning to Motorola segment, our gross revenue there was $1.2 billion. As Larry mentioned, while it's still the early days, Dennis and the team have already transformed Motorola's product quality and they're working now at building marketing and distribution.
By the way, some of you may have noticed that our total consolidated revenue does not exactly equal to some of our segment revenue this quarter. This is driven by new transactions in our Motorola segment resulting in intersegment and certain deferred revenues that are eliminated in our consolidated results.
Coming back to our Google segment, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 26% year-over-year, 8% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 8% year-over-year and down 12% quarter-over-quarter. And we should note that the currency fluctuations had a real minimal impact on Q3 cost-per-click.
Once again, I wish to remind everyone that our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a whole set of factors discussed on previous calls. They include geographic mix, channel mix, property mix as well as product and policy changes.
Turning to geographic performance of our Google segment, we continue to see steady performance in the U.S. and the U.K. and strong performance in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculation.
The U.S. revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $6.1 billion and it's worth noting that network revenue that I mentioned a bit earlier which continues to be impacted by ongoing policy decisions skew toward the U.S. The U.K. was up 14% year-over-year to $1.4 billion which includes a small $17 million benefit from our hedging program. In fixed FX the U.K. grew 15% year-over-year.
In our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. accounted for 46% of total revenue or $6.3 billion. This was up 28% year-over-year which includes a $5 million benefit from our hedging program and in fixed FX terms, our rest of world actually grew 32% year-over-year.
Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $3.3 billion in Q3 excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled 4.3 billion again excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. For a non-GAAP operating profit was $4.3 billion in Q3 resulting in non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 29%.
For Google segment our traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $2.3 billion excluding $133 million of SBC. Google segment operating expenses were $3.9 billion also excluding SBC of $723 million.
Depreciation and amortization expense on our property, plant and equipment for the Google segment was $630 million this quarter. And our Google segment operating profit as a result was a strong $4.6 billion in Q3 resulting in Google segment operating margin of 34%.
At Motorola our total segment operating expenses including cost of revenue were $1.4 billion. That excludes $30 million of stock-based compensation and $12 million of Motorola restructuring charges. Please keep in mind that intangible amortization expense attributed to the Google segment and Motorola are in fact included in these segment measures.
Of the $281 million in consolidated intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola of which $116 million was allocated to Google segment and $37 million allocated to the Motorola segment. And as a result, the operating loss at Motorola segment was $248 million in Q3 and operating margins for that segment were negative 21%.
Headcount for the consolidated business was roughly 1,500 people, up in Q3. The Google segment added just about 2,000 people during the quarter and in total the consolidated company ended the quarter with approximately 46,000 full-time employees. Our effective tax rate was 15% in Q3. Our tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continued mix shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
Let me now turn to cash management. Our other income and expense was 24 million for this quarter. The impact of FAS 133 expense from our hedging program and realized losses mostly offset interest income in this quarter. And as you know we often get questions on quarter-to-quarter volatility of our hedging costs.
So to help everyone understand this better, we put together a video tutorial on the topic. You can find the new video on our Investor Relations website. I hope you find it helpful and let us know what you think. For more detail on OI&E, please again refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.1 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.3 billion. This quarter the majority of our CapEx was spent on production equipment, data center construction and real estate purchases. As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest for the long term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area of investment for us.
Consequently, our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, very strong again. So there you have it. Strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth fully in the opportunities, areas including Mobile Business, Android, Chrome, YouTube, Enterprise just to name a few. With that I’ll hand it off to Nikesh, who’ll cover more details of our business performance in the quarter and after these remarks we’ll open up the phone lines for questions. Here you go, Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned our business had a strong quarter with $13.8 billion in Google segment gross revenue. Overall performance was strong in the retail sector. We had good growth in Japan, South Korea and Australia. There are three key areas I want to talk about today, that are big growth drivers for us and our partners. First; our continued efforts to make advertising seamless, effective and measurable across multiple screens. Second; our progress in bringing bad advertisers online with a special emphasis on our efforts that are on Youtube; and third our early investments in commerce and shopping to help users, retailers and merchants. And last say a few words about newly areas like digital content, hardware and enterprise.
On seamless advertising; it's been a few months since our advertisers moved over to enhanced campaigns and AdWords. Clients are telling us they like the new system. Many are still adjusting their campaigns and keywords and developing their multi-screen bidding strategies. For example; we’re seeing advertisers bidding more frequently in mobile keywords because enhanced campaigns makes it so much easier to do so. They’re discovering how they can use the needed capabilities in mobile and their ads, like location Click2Call. Example is discover who has just increased their mobile spend and used it to promote their [it card].
Talking about mobile, we’ve also launched cross device measurement tools and analytics. There are three observations here. First; mobile is driving higher online conversion. American Apparels found that mobile ads were actually driving 16% more conversions than they initially thought and as a result they’re now investing more to drive more sales. Second, mobile drives more phone calls. On average there are more than 40 million calls driven by Google ads every month, this is twice as much as it was a year ago. Third, mobile drives in-store traffic.
Moving over to brand in YouTube. You’ve seen that our CPG and entertainment clients have moved online at greater speed with our efforts that are on brand. Spend by our CPG clients on displaying YouTube has grown over 75% over the past two years. For example, the Google YouTube campaign for Dove’s Camera Shy brand in more than 20 countries and delivered over 62 million views for Unilever. We’re also partnering very closely with agencies, we really like integrating our technology, insights and media with their creativity and client relationships.
For agencies, marketers and Googlers it's a huge win, win, win. All of the top 10 global agencies now use our DoubleClick products. On the other side YouTube continues to do well. Video ads which include CUview now form a significant part of our YouTube in brand advertising and they’re growing north of 75% year-over-year. We found that YouTube is our brand torch bearer. It offers brands valuable engaged audiences, terrific reach and compelling context. Smart brands are really loving their engagement with YouTube.
Moving on to commerce and shopping. As Google search moves to provide people with answers and entities not just links, we’re making good progress helping people take commercial access too like buying products. We’re seeing great traction on product listing ads both in desktop and mobile. As part of this moved to a seamless purchasing experience we’re also helping retailers offer better payment solutions to their customers particularly on mobile where it's traditionally been difficult. Google Wallet InstaBuy helps merchants here up implementing instant buy Google (indiscernible) saw that from May to August users of Google Wallet on their Android app had a purchase conversion rate that was four times higher than other shoppers.
Finally I want to talk about an area which we’re being putting more emphasis on which is our investment in emerging non-ads businesses. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see acceleration in the new businesses such as hardware, digital content and enterprise. As Larry mentioned Chromecast and Chromebooks are enjoying great success. Chromebooks are now available in over 8000 locations around the world and are being used in more than 20% of school districts in United States. We’re also rolling out unified Google experience in more than 750 Best Buy stores to showcase Chromebooks, Chromecast and the newest Nexus devices under our one Google branded design.
On digital apps and content we continue to work hard to roll out Google Play in more markets around the world and add content to it. For instance this quarter to help students go back to school we added a comprehensive catalogue of textbooks to Google Play Books for rental purchase. We brought on content partners like HBO and DC Entertainment. This quarter we brought Play Music to eight more countries and Play Books to 18 new countries. So for example now users in Russia can enjoy music and users in Indonesia can enjoy books. There’s tremendous momentum here and we look forward to making progress in this area.
Another strong area of recovering and growing revenue is our enterprise software business, making available the best of Google for work. Some great new clients this quarter include whirlpool which is now using Google Apps to help 30,000 employees collaborate and innovate more quickly. In education, apps for education is being used by 30 million students, faculty and staff worldwide. Beyond apps, Amtrak uses Google Maps to let people see all the trains in the U.S. in real time, and we’re continuing to invest in the Google Cloud Platform which has over 300,000 customers including Sanmina, a Fortune 500 Company using cloud platforms to build internal applications that improve their efficiency across their offices globally.
Lastly let me call out the efforts of our marketing team that continues to roll out the Google Welcome Mat to the world. To put on our third annual Google Science Fair honoring 15 global finalists from the ages of 13 to 18 from around the world where we hosted 400 partners and customers who are at our Annual Site Cast Event, more interestingly to introduce the newest version of Android called KitKat, we’ve built a partnership with Nestle to get more than 50 million special Android KitKat chocolate bars on store shelves around the world. And I have to give a shout out to the wonderful ad for our Nexus devices featuring the great sport of cricket that our marketing team is running in Australia, that’s a bit of a personal favorite sport. With that, let me hand it over to Patrick. Thank you again to all the Googlers for all their hard work in getting us here.
Patrick Pichette
So there you have it folks. Why don’t we have Jamie turn on the lines and then we’ll take your questions. So Jamie, over to you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great, two questions please. Could you talk about how long you think it will take for advertisers to move over to fully embrace the multi-screen advertising world which enhanced campaign should enable or facilitate. And then secondly the skunk’s works question, voice recognition technology at the Company I think it’s something you’ve been working on for years, I think it's what enables wearable devices in the future. Can you talk about how far along you are in developing a technology to be where you want it to be? Thank you.
Larry Page
Yeah; thanks Mark for the questions. I think the first part of your question I’ll to send Nikesh in a minute and I’ll take the voice recognition question. I think we made tremendous progress on voice recognition. Even in period of months probably the last couple of months or six months the accuracy has gone up quite a bit. If you haven't tried it, I’d really recommend you to try that, it's super fast, on the motor axe, you can say, okay Google now, even if your phone is turned off it will turn on and answer your question. So, I think we’re super excited about that, and I think we made tremendous strives and we’ll continue to improve accuracy in that and to make the products better. But I think they’re already super useful and we have a lot of usage coming from voice. So Nikesh, in the enhanced campaigns.
Nikesh Arora
Hey, Mark as you know on the topic of enhanced campaigns the challenge we had as we moved into a multi-screen world was, everybody was producing solutions where we had to basically run campaigns on different devices in a different way because it's this evolution that happened from desktop to mobile to video ads et cetera. And effectively what our team working with Susan and Sheila’s team have been able to do is to provide one single interface and one single mechanism to be able to manage our campaigns across multiple devices. Now that’s a good thing because it improves process, let’s them see the ROI across various devices with the analytic tools that we’ve come up with. But also there’s a lot of work that needs to happen on the advertisers side because they have to develop beautiful experiences for their customers on mobile devices as well as on their screen. So I think it's a process where we’re all going through this together, advertisers love this new mechanism. They’re adjusting their keywords and they’re bidding models based on all this new effort and we’re seeing great progress in terms people are already advertising those. But not only that, we’re also working with all of our advertisers to make sure they have great experiences on their other screens and other devices so that they can truly leverage this. So, I think this is definitely the sort of the first set of steps we’ve taken to towards future or multi-screen devices and multi-screen advertising but we think this is the way things are going to keep evolving.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks, Larry.
Patrick Pichette
Jamie, why don't we go to our next call?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital Inc.
Larry, can you discuss Google's overall ecommerce strategy, how the Knowledge Graph structure data plays into it and generally how Google can improve the users' ecommerce experience? And then Nikesh, you touched briefly on the brand efforts and I was looking at some data recently that shows that over the past 15 years virtually all the games for online advertising has come at the extent of print and radio and none of it has come from television budgets. What specifically is happening now that makes you think it's more likely for the television dollars to finally begin to come online and to Google in particular? And then just a quick housekeeping one for Patrick. Can you just give us a bit more detail on how the accounting works for the intersegment transactions and how it impacts the consolidated model? Thanks.
Larry Page
Like a three-way question [indiscernible]. So I think on the ecommerce side, I think Google's been used for e-commerce for forever and we're really excited about doing a better job of that. I think we want to remove friction when people are buying online or in the real world. We know people often click on an ad in a mobile device and then make their purchase on the laptop or they might in fact buy it in the store and we need to really get the conversion data there to the advertiser. So I think we've done work across all those things, across multi-screens, multi-devices from online to offline. We recently launched cross-device measurement in AdWords and we're also just trying to make it easier for people to buy things in general. It's as simple as that's same day shipping in local inventory and search. Like I said, we're just looking to reduce friction and we're very excited about that.
Nikesh Arora
Yes. Hi, Ben. If you look at the last 15 years of history like you talk about, a lot of the gains of online advertising have actually come at the expense of what we would call performance advertising. Anytime you wanted to interact with users, get people to come into your store, get people to buy your product, get people to click on your website, all those gains have happened in performance which has been great. But what's beginning to happen is as the watch time on various online video sites continues to grow, as more and more online video begins to be available in a nonlinear fashion in television screens or recent as Larry talked about Chromecast, that stuff or a bunch of the gaming devices, a bunch of other TV solutions, they're beginning to see a lot more watch time being expended either on your desktop or on your multi-screen devices or even on your television. As that begins to happen that advertising is more addressable, more directly attributable and provides more measurement and capabilities. So we believe that that's definitely a more superior opportunity for advertisers to be able to attract their brand customers and actually know who's at the other end. So I think that trend is definitely in the right direction and we're getting upward.
Patrick Pichette
So why don't I take the last question which was the housekeeping item. Actually this is pretty straightforward change, Ben. So in Q3 our Motorola and Google segments purchased and sold services to each other and these transactions are reflected in our Google and Motorola segment revenues. The main thing analysts need to realize as they update their model this time is that the total consolidated revenue will no longer necessarily like in the quarters where there is transaction between the two equal the sum of the Google and Motorola segment revenues. So analysts who currently sum up our segment revenues and profits to derive consolidated estimates should need to model in elimination lines for the intersegment revenue and profit in order to get their consolidated estimates. So that's simple as that.
Thanks for the questions. So, Jamie, why don't we go – thanks, Ben – to our next caller.

We'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. Larry, I hope that when you come up with voice recognition, it can deal with funny accents. Anyway the perception by people outside the company is that Google spends a material amount in long-term R&D that will not generate revenue in the next two years or so. Larry, can you help us understand how you think about funding this project and how much do they correspond versus your total R&D budget? And secondly, Patrick, you said in the past that CapEx is lumpy and we should expect fluctuations but now we have had three quarters of what looks like high CapEx versus recent past. Have the last few quarters been normal? Thank you.
Larry Page
Yes, thanks, Carlos. I think we definitely are working on accents, so I appreciate that. I think that on the long-term R&D question, I think we don't break all this on detail, but I would say that, my stronghold in general is to get people to spend money on long-term R&D. In most companies I think even companies that have significant R&D budgets, if you look at that maybe 99% of it ends up being really incremental, which is relatively small improvements to kind of your existing businesses, and maybe 1% of that ends up being kind of true long-term things like Android was when it got started. So I think I kind of view my job as the opposite thing is to get people to spend on the long-term R&D. I do think people have a perception that's material. I don't think that – that's not been my experience and so it's very hard to actually spend money on long-term things in any kind of meaningful way. And even the investments we've announced, things like Calico or rather an absolute dollar number's probably significant amounts, they're not significant for Google. And I think you should actually be asking me to make more significant investments. I wish I knew how to do that but I think it's actually very difficult to spend kind of meaningful amounts of money relative to goal scale on things that are speculative.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Larry. Carlos, on the issue of CapEx just to reiterate the fact that the majority of the CapEx this quarter was spent on production equipment, so like machines, data center construction looking ahead and building the capacity ahead of our needs to get the flexibility and real estate purchases, so we had a number of kind of really good opportunistic purchases in the portfolio we were targeting and they kind of came online this quarter, so pretty pleased with that. I think that overall investors should see this as a very positive sign and a positive signal. As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest really for the long term and just a conversation we're having with Larry on the topic of R&D. And our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area for investment for us. It's really important that when we see signals of or opportunities where we need capacity, the worst thing for us would be to actually not have it in terms of machines and data center capacity. So the strategic value of having it for flexibility for our long-term positions are really important. That's what you see reflected in our investments right now.
So thank you for your question, Carlos.

Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Thanks. Larry, just to follow-up on Ben's question earlier, it seems like you guys have all the pieces in place with Android, with Maps, with Google Now, Wallet, credit card information in the Play store to kind of vertically integrate the experience from research search to purchase in the local and transactional areas, kind of the closing of the loop if you will. So can you just elaborate on the overall strategy and how does the recent cross screen conversion estimates enhance play into that? Thanks.
Larry Page
Thanks, Ross. We have all positions available [indiscernible]. I think we certainly agree with that. I think it was a pretty good description of me. We all account many different pieces of your commercial experiences. I think in general I mean now our experience for users is not that seamless and there is lots of different pieces of technology and processes in order to make commerce happen and so on. So I think we have got something we absolutely are looking at improving about closing the loop and so on. I mean I think your question actually is pretty good, so really I don't know that I can add much more.

We'll go next to Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets
Hi. Good afternoon, guys. My question was for Larry. Since you've come back into the CEO's role, one of the things we've noticed with Google is that your own advertising spending has moved up and once upon a time Google was a company that didn't need to advertise and obviously you're in a lot more businesses these days from where you started, but maybe just philosophically how you view that for Google long term as you do launch into more secondary products other than search. And then just one quick follow-up with the Canadian Government announcing this week that they’ll look to pursue unbundling of TV subscriptions; would you ever consider taking Google Fiber to a market outside of the U.S?
Larry Page
Yes, Dan thanks for the questions. And I think we saw a lot of advertising and we do a modest amount of advertising. I think we find that pretty useful and we’ve gone better at doing it, and I think it's good for our business, it's good for us to understand kind of the advertising perspective from a advertisers point of view given that’s some big business for us. I might want Nikesh to elaborate a little bit on that. In Fiber, I think it's really just early days. We’re just getting going on that.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, to follow-up on the marketing question, I think we still encourage our product teams to go out there and get their products to be used by users, the [merits] of the products, because we believe that’s all the marketing that they can have. But as our products get more and more popular there are many part of the world we want to make sure there’s awareness for those products and people understand what the capabilities and features are. That’s the only time we bring in marketing to kick in. And the other area we do a lot of marketing in is in trying to make sure that our advertisers understand the advertising opportunity so that they can actually can spend money with us; so that’s roughly how we think about marketing. But the primary focus is definitely on making sure we create great products that users use and the products stand and get (indiscernible) their own merits.
Larry Page
All right. That’s very correct. Let’s go to the next question.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Hi, good afternoon. Question for Larry in terms of, you talked about R&D spending and just the amount that you’re going to be gauging at. Can you talk specifically about self driving cars that realizes way down the road, but how real is this as a business and then separately in terms of CPCs how should we see these -- how should we see enhanced campaigns impacting CPCs over the next few quarters? Thanks.
Larry Page
Okay, great questions from Gene; thank you. So I think, I guess on self driving cars specifically I think for any big innovation I think you overestimate short-term and underestimate long-term, that’s probably good summary for self driving cars. I think we made tremendous progress and we’ve driven large amounts of miles, how we change the business from being something that wasn’t going to happen at all to something that now is somewhere inevitable and people’s feelings about it which I think is tremendous progress. That said it’s still pretty early days from the product, I don’t know exactly what I have been saying but its still ways from being a commercial product. Probably overestimate that in the short-term like I said and underestimate that in the long-term. Now for the second part of the question.
Patrick Pichette
Why don’t I jump in for a second, CPCs. Listen we don’t, because you asked the question about, what do we expect quarter over the coming quarters. We don’t really manage the quarterly CPC trends. We actually focus on the user and the advertiser ROI. So in general right we attribute CPC trends to a combination of those five factors I talked about, FX the three mix effects of mobile versus desktop, emerging markets versus developed markets, the channel mix between our sites and our network, then a number of products and policy changes; that’s really the big driver. I think that we’re really pleased as Nikesh mentioned enhanced campaigns is a great platform that enables us for a future and as long as we actually have the format that delivers the great ROI then enhanced campaigns will just accelerate this in the future and that’s what we’re working on. So, it's really the complex puzzle and it's important that not only we think about CPCs in the context of all the factors I talked about. But what's even more important is the dynamic of those CPCs and page clicks together. That’s really the magic that actually talks about our growth.
Larry Page
All right. Our next question please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.
Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies & Co.
Yeah, hi it's Tim O'Shea for Brian Pitz. I know it's still early, but can you give us a broad sense for how you’re feeling about the holiday shopping season, and do you have any sense of the updated Google shopping or PLA program has made you better positioned to capitalize this holiday. And then just quickly can you give us a sense of what kind of attraction you’re seeing from the recent implementation of localized PLAs during the quarter? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Just to say that we clearly do not, as you all know we don’t give any sense of what's going on in the fourth quarter. We actually just are closing our third quarter so we don’t give forward guidance on any of it. I think maybe Nikesh can give a sense of where PLAs are going in general.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, thanks Patrick. Tim, I think the important part in PLAs since I mentioned in the prepared remarks is that we are transitioning from giving users answers in terms of links to taking them down to entities and PLAs in a product listing ads is definitely a big step in that direction because we believe that’s a great answer for the user and a good user experience of the long-term especially more interesting in mobile devices. So, from a long-term user experience perspective we believe that is the right direction; that is a good user experience to have, not going to particularly comment how that is going to impact, what happens in the next few weeks, for the next few quarters?
Larry Page
All right. Our next question.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Ken Sena with Evercore.
Ken Sena - Evercore Partners
Hi, thank you. On Google Play it's my understanding that much of the 30% that developers don’t keep actually goes to carriers and OEMs. So I was just wondering if you can update us maybe on those negotiations and kind of when you see Google maybe receiving a greater portion of plays the economics; and then maybe if you could just update us too on your thoughts on travel. Thank you.
Larry Page
Okay, Nikesh will take the play part there.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, on Google Play as you know that Google Play has been something that our teams have worked really hard on in the last two years to make sure because that sort of fills out the Android ecosystem and as a key part of making the Android experience a great experience by having great content, great apps on the Google Play system. And in terms of economics, the economics like you said rightfully are shared between developers, carriers, OEMs and us and our key with Google Play is to make sure that there is a robust ecosystem. People like Android devices that provides some great functionality and we believe anybody who brings value to that ecosystem should have economics in that ecosystem once a carrier, OEM or a developer or us. We’re not going to specifically talk about who keeps what part of the economics, but just to say that we’re comfortable with the way the economics work out, and the more important part is, it is helping drive the ecosystem in the right direction.
Larry Page
Also Nikesh on travel.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, on travel we continue to work on travel. As you know we have a great exciting product on flight search and we have our IDA business and we’re happen with the business the way it is. We are working hard on making sure that the entity level concepts that applies to a product it also applies for travel as in terms of flight search.
Ken Sena - Evercore Partners
All right. Thank you.
Larry Page
All right. The next question.
Operator
And we will go next to Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Co.
Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.
Great. Thanks very much. First question is, curious how you guys are thinking about the future of cookies in online advertising, obviously a lot of chatter about privacy issues and perhaps Google working on that ideas and alternative. And then secondly haven’t heard a whole lot about Japan, although we’re seeing pretty -- fairly rapid shift to android in that market, I wonder if you can comment on the Google business Japan and the pace of growth there? Thank you.
Larry Page
Okay. So maybe Nikesh can you address the cookie version?
Nikesh Arora
Yes, I mean, from our perspective we believe that technological enhancements can definitely improve user security in order to make sure that the web continues to remain economically viable in that transition. So we’ve a lot of concept to this area, but it’s very early right now to try and actually elaborate them and talk about what’s going to work, what’s not going to work. But as I said the primary motive is to make sure that we can keep enhancing technologically what’s going on, what’s going to make sure that if we don’t bring the system and you make sure that things stay secure and economically viable.
In terms of Japan, as I mentioned Japan has been good for us this quarter. And as you rightfully identified that we’re -- we continue to see robust growth in the sort of the multi screen space. In that market, clearly it’s an early adopter market as it relates to mobility and tablets and devices. So you can -- we’re feeling very good about how the consumer behavior there is and how that translates into advertising.
Larry Page
Next question.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse
Larry different question on Google Fiber, if I may. It’s now rolled out in a few regions around the country. Can you share with us some of your early learnings in terms of how consumer behavior changed once the connection speed stepped up materially in this new environment? And what kind of new services or products you think Google can rollout or how your existing services can change for the better? Thanks.
Larry Page
Thanks, Stephen. So I think again it’s very early on Google Fiber. It’s announced in several places I think really rolling out in Kansas City. I think one of the things that’s unique about the Google Fiber offering is that your television service is available right through the data connection. So one big change in having a high-speed data connection is actually the entire kind of television experience, cable TV like experience comes straight through your data connection, through your gigabit connection. And people I think have been pretty excited about that experience being a great experience for watching television actually.
So our next question.
Operator
We'll go next to John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.
John Blackledge - Cowen and Company
Great. Thanks for the question. I wondered if you can review the content strategy at YouTube and the willingness to invest in areas like live sports, like the NFL and how the content strategy would play in the evolution of YouTube over time. Thank you.
Larry Page
Thank you, John, for the question. I think I'll also give this one to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Well, again as we've always said that YouTube is an ecosystem which is a combination of great users, great advertisers and great content and we talk to content providers all the time because we understand that users come to YouTube so that they can enjoy both user-generated content, other forms of content both short form and long form. So we're pretty comfortable that we're making great sort of progress. The number of hours that people watch YouTube continues to go up, the amount of videos uploaded to YouTube continues to go up. And as Larry mentioned, we're seeing a lot of YouTube usage coming out of mobiles. So really our content strategy in YouTube is working. We're constantly talking to people about content all the time and so sure, we will talk to anybody who wants to talk about content. But for now we're happy with where we are. In the end our goal is to help make sure that our users have a good experience, that they get to see the right content on there and our advertisers are able to advertise on that platform.
John Blackledge - Cowen and Company
Thank you.
Larry Page
Our next question.
Operator
We'll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Hi, thanks. A bigger picture question for Larry and components of the question have been touched on in the call, but there has been a debate for some time about the Internet becoming more vertical and accelerated by the transition to mobile and if that could serve as a headwind for Google's business, yet your core revenue growth has been remarkably stable for several quarters now, above 20%. And Larry you've talked about this broad topic in prior calls, but I was just wondering if you can give an updated view of the landscape as it relates to your efforts to go deeper into the transition funnel to offset verticalization as well as if you could share your perception of Google's competitive position in a multi-device world versus the legacy desktop, laptop world? And then secondly, any timeline or thoughts that you can give on Project Loon in terms of it becoming a commercial offering? Thanks.
Larry Page
All right. Thanks, Scott, for the questions. So I think – so the first topic is pretty complex topic, I think we're very well positioned in mobile. I've said this before where we have the Android. I think we have tremendous services on Android. And we have obviously search and things that work across many different things. I'm tremendously excited about the funding. We have the potential to really improve people's experience as they move more into mobile and spend more time there and to make those experiences much more efficient and pleasurable and beautiful for those users. Often as I do things with third parties and one thing to keep in mind is we've done a lot of effort around the APIs on Android and we're working with top developers in and around Google Play as a marketplace for those developers. Those things are evolving all the time with the help of some users and help of those developers. So we have a lot of ideas there and a lot of work going on. So I'm actually very, very excited about that. I think we're tremendously well positioned to help them [indiscernible] move along and make users' experiences better and to improve our business from the developers' businesses. I think – even I find I'm spending most of my time now on mobile and not so much on the old desktop world, because I guess a lot of people are going to generally do over time. I think on Project Loon, again it's really early for that. So we announced because we had to, because people are seeing them and they're flying around and so on. But it's a small team, it's very exciting. We've been totally amazed by the positive reaction we've gotten across the world and from high speed and telcos and other people wanting to work with us, which is tremendous, we want to work with all of them. I think I found something important in trying to improve rural Internet access, which is something that if you're one of the significant number of people in a rural area or a place that doesn't have great Internet access now, it is something that really matters to your quality of life. So we're excited about that.
Patrick Pichette
We have time probably for two more questions, so why don't we jump in on the last two. Jamie?
Operator
We'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you taking the question. Larry, I just was wondering with advertisers having more choice of broad platforms to use for spending their digital ad dollars and in particular on mobile, I'm just wondering do you see a big acceleration in dollars moving from offline to online, do you see that pace accelerating over the next few years? And also how will Google continue to differentiate itself here?
Larry Page
Yes, I guess I'll give that to Nikesh. I'll just say we've always seen a lot of choices in advertising. We've always competed a while in that market and I think people are definitely getting more and more excited about moving dollars online. For us I think the measurability of it, the strength of the tools that are available and technologies to do that we just see as an amazing opportunity and I think people are more and more realizing them. Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
Yes, to build on what Larry said I think he's right that we are expecting more and more dollars to move towards these platforms for a variety of reasons. One, there are more options for some more players in the market which are – that means they are all working hard towards the same goal of convincing advertisers and this is the place where the users are and this is where advertisers need to be. Also if you think about what's going on, it's as I said earlier in the context of YouTube, we are going to see more and more video coming on to the web and online mechanisms is more targetable and more addressable. In terms of our differentiation, if you look at what we've done over the last many years is we've actually worked in terms of trying to provide a comprehensive solution across all digital capability whether it's on Google, whether it's off Google, whether it's in our network, whether it's with us, whether it's with partners that are on the web, whether it's with mobile devices, whether it's on desktop devices, whether it's from display ads, search ads or video ads, if you look at it what we're trying to do is we're trying to make sure that when an advertiser wants to reach users, we can provide them a comprehensive solution that they can go ahead and advertise. And if you couple that with measurement which is what sort of makes online so much more compelling that if you are going to look at measurement, look at analytics around it, so advertisers get a lot more information. They have lot more options and of course in the end we want to make sure that we focus on very high quality ads. So if you combine all of those things, we think we can continue to be working towards providing them comprehensive solution and we work really hard with all the players in the ecosystem whether it's publishers, agencies or other media property owners, so we feel good about this.
Larry Page
Our next question.
Operator
We'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. A couple of things. First, on the rest of world acceleration, could you let us know if there was any platforms like mobile or products like maybe YouTube that really kind of kicked in the quarter that really help drive that, maybe it was Google Play? And then on Motorola it's now getting close to $1 billion run rate on annual losses. Could you remind us of the synergies that you're seeing with that and why you're encouraged by that and maybe when that could start to turn the other way? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
So clearly on international, not only is our kind of core search business performing very well, but also as you've seen other revenues which includes the Play platform is actually doing pretty well internationally. So those two are the big contributors for that one. As we stand on Motorola, I mean Larry mentioned it very well at the beginning of the call, right? It is still early days for us. I think that we have Dennis and the team have already made a huge transformation at Motorola. We have now great product quality, the Moto X, the first of the products that have come out and it's actually been very well received, a great product. So the team is now really working on building out marketing and distribution which is the kind of phase of it. So that's the mindset that we put in Motorola. This is not a this quarter or next quarter but much more – a more fundamental kind of optimistic and recent view of the company. So that's how we think of these issues. Thanks, Justin.
Larry Page
We may have time for one more question.
Operator
We'll take our final question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two things I wanted to ask about. First, just on Enhanced Campaigns, can you give us some sense of what it meant for overall spending in the quarter and then also how do you get advertisers to use the location and time of date, modifiers going forward. And then just on the U.S. business there was a [decel] there of about 500 basis points from last quarter? Patrick you mentioned the networks shifts there obviously, but was there anything else going on there?
Patrick Pichette
No, I mean, on your U.S. network it really is as you know there are changes in policies. They basically affect dramatically more our network and because of our network, think of AFS is really very heavy weighted to U.S., that’s really what’s been the main driver for that change. I will let Nikesh take the front end of the question.
Nikesh Arora
Yes, in terms of enhanced campaigns, I’m not quite sure what do you mean by what it meant for overall spending in the quarter.
Unidentified Analyst
Is it positive, I mean, was it incremental to revenue do you think in the quarter?
Nikesh Arora
Yes, we don’t -- do we say it on the enhanced campaign, so we’re not actually trying to quantify the effect, because we believe its part of your overall experience and its step in the right direction in terms of what you want to achieve. In terms of your question as it relates to location and time of day modifiers. I mean these are requests from advertisers, but to give you an example usually when a car rental company advertises when somebody is in airport, they’re likely to get a higher click through rate and higher conversion than if somebody is searching for car rentals when they’re sitting at the desktop. So the location can be used as a great modifier in terms of advertising, in terms of getting better conversion, that’s just one example. We’ve millions of examples like that where you can actually use location very effectively or time of day very effectively, the traditional example of when I’m hungry you show me an ad more likely to click an ad that offers me restaurant choice or food choice than if I’m not hungry and it’s late at night. So there are different modifiers that allow us to pay different advertising. People shop more at lunch time, so there is a whole bunch of stuff that comes in when you start providing location and time of day modifiers. So I think it’s good. Thank you.
Larry Page
I want to thank everyone for spending so much time with us and turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Just before we close the call, I think we’ve great news to announce. I mean all of you that have worked with us, with the investor community group; you know that Willa Chalmers who is part of our IR team has been kind of missing in action for the last few weeks. I’m just incredibly proud to announce that Jacob Allen Chalmers is now in the world and has arrived a couple of days ago, mom is doing incredibly well, so Willa is doing great too. So just to let you know that she has not disappeared, she is doing great, the whole family is. We are all ecstatic about it and it’s another great kind of Googler addition for the family. So that’s why Willa disappeared for a few weeks.
With that, I will turn it back to Larry to close the call.

Larry Page
Hello, everyone and thanks for joining our call this afternoon. Google had a great quarter. Over $14 billion of revenue, up 19% year-on-year, amazing performance for a Company that is yet to celebrate its 15th birthday. We live in a world of abundant computing, with multiple operating systems and increasing number of the devices. And it’s a very different environment from when Google started. There was essentially one OS, and one device category, the PC. These kind of changes don’t happen that often. Once a decade, maybe even less are coming. The shift from laptop to mobiles, from on screen to multiple screens, create a tremendous opportunity for Google. With more devices, more information and more activity online than ever, the potential to improve people’s lives is immense.
Getting you the right information, just when you need it, creating the tools to make everyone more effective at home and at work, and helping you share and remember the moments that matter in life.
That’s why I’m so excited about the velocity and execution of our platforms, apps, and devices. First, platforms. With hindsight, Android and Chrome were no brainers. At the time, they were big bets. The movements across these platforms is tremendous. As you saw in our Annual Average Developer Conference in May, I was astounded, we had over 1 million people tuning in life just to watch our developer keynote.
We’ve now activated more than 900 million Android devices worldwide and we’re lining up our over 1.5 million devices every day. That’s pretty amazing as in the first android phone launched less than five years ago and apps usage is increasing fast. Over 50 million apps have been now downloaded from the Google Playstore. In fact, we already paid out more money to Android developers this year than in the whole of 2012.
I love the ability to access your stuff on play anywhere. Take our new music subscription service, launched in May, it has a new fun way to discover new music, with all the songs there ready to go. I’ve to think about the delay seriously. Chrome, even though only four year old, has over 750 million users worldwide and growing.
The next apps, our goal is to design everything so it’s beautifully simple and hassle free. Users shouldn’t have to need to think about our technology, it should just work. This quarter we completely revamped our maps. The map is a screen, no clutter quarter around the edges, because more information about your surroundings, so it’s easier to explore. And we launched a new improved navigation feature. And not execution about incidents, before you leave and updates to save time if traffic condition change.
First of all, this new maps experience is now available on almost all devices, you would be likely to use. The same with Google plus. We’ve done a complete redesign to make using the entire screen and that really looks consistent to whatever the delays or the platform. In addition, the team massively upgraded the photos experience. Making software design for professionals automatically available to everyone for fee. There is no need for wrinkles anymore.
Take a look on Plus, many of your photos will now be marked enhanced and improved automatically.
Finally we launched a new communication app called Hangouts. You can talk to the people you care about across all the major platforms. Video calls from your phone are very cool, give them a try.
And I'm excited about the progress we've continued to make with Search. Our Knowledge Graph is now available in 29 languages and we've expanded the range of information available. For example, we just added nutrition data. Ask Google how many calories there are in a glass of white wine and you'll find out its 123, or an avocado, 235 calories. It's good to have the facts if you want to keep healthy. And we launched Google Now on iOS in April.
In the same way, we want to make advertising super simple for customers. Online advertising have developed in very specific ways with separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This made arduous work for advertisers and agencies and meant mobile opportunities often got missed.
It's why we launched Enhanced Campaigns. Advertisers have upgraded 6 million campaigns. That's almost 75% of all their active campaigns. And Nikesh will talk in a little more detail about the positive reaction from clients. This is the biggest ever change to AdWords and the velocity and execution has been great thanks to the hard work of all the teams.
Finally, devices; there is so much excitement around new devices today and the potential for innovation is tremendous. You can now buy the HTC One and the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play editions and enjoy the best of Google. There's a ton of momentum around Chromebooks, which are growing fast and defying the more general decline in PC sales.
Finally, I know you're all eagerly anticipating what Motorola is launching soon. Having been a tester for a while, I'm really excited. We're very optimistic about the opportunities in front of Google today. The potential for technology to make people's lives better is tremendous. But to achieve that potential we need to stay focused. It's why we continue to invest the vast majority of our resources and time in our core products. But my job as CEO is also to think about the future and ensure we continue to bet on new technology that can solve big problems in the world.
Project Loon, which we launched in June, is a great example. Bringing affordable, balloon-powered Internet access to remote areas is an idea that Sergey and I had been thinking about for over a decade. It was great to see that project literally get off the ground, and give people a bit more hope for an improving world.
None of this would happen without great people and we are so lucky that we have them. I'd like to thank all the Googlers and Motorolans who make everything possible. Keep up that velocity and execution.
Now, I'll hand the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Larry, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. So why don't we go dive in by reviewing the details of our overall business financial performance, so here we go. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $14.1 billion. The overall business was up 1% quarter-over-quarter.
Google standalone gross revenue grew 20% year-over-year to 13.1 billion and was up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google website revenues was up 18% year-over-year to 8.9 billion and was in fact up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google network revenue grew 7% year-over-year to 3.2 billion and was down 2% quarter-over-quarter.
You'll remember the advertising policy decisions we implemented during Q4 and Q1 to ensure the useful and safe user experience continued to have its negative impact on network revenue. Other revenue grew 138% year-over-year to $1 billion and roughly flat quarter-over-quarter.
Play store digital sales of apps and content drove the year-on-year and quarter-over-quarter growth and it's worth noting that in Q1, we included some seasonal hardware sales due to overflow from Q4 which skewed the Q2 comps somewhat. Finally, please note that without currency fluctuations Google standalone revenue growth would in fact have been 22% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to Motorola Mobility, gross revenue there was $998 million, just shy of a $1 billion and it's clear that we've made a lot of progress at Motorola in the past year and that we are especially excited about the future of our upcoming product lineup, so stay tuned.
At Google, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong at 22% year-over-year, in fact up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-paid was down 6% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter and currency fluctuations in this case had a minimal effect in Q2 CPC growth, and yet our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by the usual factors that we've discussed many times including geographic mix, channel mix, property mix, our product and policy changes as well as FX.
Turning to the geographic performance of Google standalone business, we continued to see a steady performance in the U.S. and rest of world, while the UK was negatively impacted by a warm spring, some FX in their case and a tough year-over-year comp. In our earnings slides which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., UK and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
U.S. revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $5.9 billion. The UK was up 12% year-over-year to 1.3 billion which included 24 million of benefits from our hedging program. It is in fact worth noting that in fixed FX terms, the UK grew 15% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue, excluding UK, accounted for 45% of the total revenue or 5.9 billion and it was up 23% year-over-year which includes 11 million benefits from our hedging program. In fixed FX terms, rest of world grew a solid 28%.
Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, our other cost of revenue was 2.9 billion in Q2 excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled 4.2 billion also excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring and our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q2 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 28%.
For standalone Google, our traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 25% of total advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was 2.1 billion, again excluding 110 of stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 3.8 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of 633 million. And non-GAAP operating profit was $4.2 billion in Q2 resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 32% for the standalone Google segment.
Please note that a reevaluation of our depreciation policy as it relates to our real estate portfolio resulted in an additional 121 million in Google segment depreciation expenses, about half of which were presented a one-time charge for assets that are now fully depreciated. With this change in place, depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment for standalone Google was 667 million for this quarter.
At Motorola Mobility, total non-GAAP operating expenses including cost of revenue were $1.2 billion. Keep in mind intangible amortization expenses attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola Mobility are in fact, included in these non-GAAP measures. Of the 283 million in intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola of which 116 million was allocated to Google and 37 million was allocated to Motorola Mobility.
And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss for Motorola Mobility was 218 million in Q2 and an non-GAAP operating margin for that segment of minus 22%. Headcount for the consolidated business was down roughly 9,000 people in Q2. Please keep in mind that consolidated headcount now excludes Motorola Home business. It also reflects the impact of the ongoing mobility restructuring. Standalone Google added about a 1,400 people during the quarter and in total the consolidated Company ended the quarter with around 44,800 full-time employees. While effective tax rate was 24% in Q2, like in Q1 several one-time items as well as the continued shift of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries impacted our tax rate this quarter and also please remember that in Q1 we also had a significant lower rate in that case due to the 2012 R&D credit which was obviously not applied to our Q2 rate.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $247 million for the quarter which reflects realized gains on investments and interest income offset by the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense on our hedging program. For more detail on OI&E again please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be very pleased with our operating cash flow which is strong this quarter at $4.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $1.6 billion, and this is versus last quarter at $1.2 billion. I want to remind everybody the majority of our CapEx spend is related to data center construction, facilities related purchases and production equipment. CapEx is just inherently lumpy. And as I mentioned last quarter during my remarks our infrastructure will continue to be a strategic area of investment. It's one of the foundations of our future growth. Our free cash flow again very strong $3.1 billion for the quarter.
Larry’s comments make it clearer that there are just enormous growth opportunities ahead of us as a Company. It's in this spirit of optimism that we continue to fully fund strategic growth opportunities with the same confidence and discipline we demonstrated while growing our Mobile Business, Android, YouTube, Chrome, just to name a few.
And with this, I’ll hand it off to Nikesh who will cover more details of our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks we’ll open up the lines for questions.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned our businesses had a strong quarter. We had over $13.1 billion in Google standalone gross revenue. Overall the performance was particularly strong in the auto sector in Brazil. And as Patrick mentioned growth in the U.K. was hampered because of a particularly warm spring. Before I talk about trends, we’re seeing in investments we’re making in our business let me call out the effort of our marketing team that continues to create great Google moments. In May, they put on our second annual YouTube brand cast event in New York for 1,800 advertisers. The event was a great way to show YouTube’s unique ability to help marketers connect with highly coveted consumers and ultimately build their brands.
At Brandcast, Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks said YouTube is a whole new entertainment paradigm, and we think he’s right. Also Larry mentioned the team put on another successful Google I/O Development Conference showcasing our incredible momentum across our platforms to over 6000 developers in San Francisco with over a million people tuning in from around the world. We continue to be pleased with how our business is evolving, growing and diversifying.
There are three key areas where we continue to make investments. First, our transformation into a marketing platform that works across the connected world Larry described. Second, our systematic move up the marketing funnel helped clients more and more with brand building campaigns. Third, our investments in our non-ads business such as enterprise services, hardware and digital contents for Google Play.
First, our message for our constantly connected users. The rapid adoption of new devices means that more people are spending more time online and connected. In fact new devices and new connectivity means we’re moving to a world where people are constantly connected with devices with them all the time. As an example you marketers say for the time spent online our mobile devices by U.S. adults grew 273% from 2009 to 2012. From 2011 to 2012 alone the time spent connected to mobile devices increased by nearly half an hour a day. This means not only a lot of new services and apps available for users and also a huge opportunity exists for businesses looking to reach mobile users at the right time and location.
That brings in enhanced campaigns. As Larry talked about this, enhanced campaigns was a big long-term bet that is designed to help advertisers more easily reach customers across devices with the right message, all within one campaign. We already migrated six million of active campaigns to enhanced campaigns over the last many months. Our goal is to migrate all of our advertisers and campaigns by the end of this month. This effort has been executed at breakneck-speed and client reaction has been generally positive.
We’re getting back evidence from clients seeing improved performance unit using enhanced campaigns. For example Pizza Hut. Social mobile ROI increased by 20%. They found that mobile click through rate has increased by more than 60% while that cost per order on smartphones is dropped by 17%. We believe enhanced campaigns does set up our clients and our business really well for the long-term and the move towards a constantly connected world goes far beyond just direct response and transaction of marketing.
People are spending time watching videos, playing games, consumer news. All this creates great new opportunities from brand marketers to engage users. In fact powered by a TrueView Format, Youtube’s mobile revenue in June of this year was three times what it was at the beginning of the year. And to help advertisers reach viewers across more screens we opened up our TrueView Formats with all of our ad mob network across 1000s of apps.
Turning our attention to brand marketers this is a very, very important area for us where we continue to invest broadly. It's important because the largest global marketers from CPG companies to film studios all conduct large major brand advertising campaigns, of course that referenced in the significant budgets that have historically been spent on TV.
A good example of this was seen in the Cannes Lions Festival; the Dove real beauty sketches campaign that appeared on YouTube won the Titanium Grand Prix award which is considered the best to the highest honor. We worked with Burberry to launch Burberry Kisses which allows users to send message to loved ones sealed with the digital imprint of their real kiss. This campaign runs on YouTube and our network across desktop, tablets and mobiles. In the last month we began to integrate our recent acquisition Wildfire into the double click platforms so that brands can now manage the broader customer journey across search, display, mobile, social, rich media and video again all within one platform.
Finally, I want to talk a little bit about our investment in emerging non-ad businesses. We’ve made a bunch of bets that are now beginning to show profit. We’re seeing acceleration in new business such as hardware, digital content and enterprise. First hardware, we continue to see great momentum across Chromebook’s and mobile devices such as our Nexus program. Around the world Chromebook’s are now in more than 6,600 brick and mortar stores including Walmart and Staples, that’s about a three time increase this quarter. As Larry said, we’ve also added two new devices to the Google Play Store from Samsung and HTC.
On the digital ads and content front, through Google Play we continue to see tremendous amount of growth in this area. People from over 190 countries now download apps from Google Play everyday. More than 50 billion apps have been downloaded so far. In the last year Google Play digital content like music and movies has launched in 21 new countries including India, Mexico, Russia, with eight more European countries launching Google Play books this week. Publishers like Penguin, Random House, Time Inc. movie studies like Disney and NBC Universal, and app developers like King and Square Enix are creating terrific experiences for our users. We’ve also collaborated with all the major record labels to launch a new music subscription service that users seem to be enjoying really -- enjoying a lot.
Lastly on the enterprise front, that’s another great revenue stream for Google. It comprises productivity apps like Docs and Gmail as well as our Cloud infrastructure. Now more than half of the Fortune 500 companies use the paid enterprise product from Google, and over 5 million businesses use our productivity apps. This means we have close long-term relationships with our enterprise customers. New customers this quarter includes some of our worlds leading businesses, like Federal Express, which has built their store locator in Google Maps, Snapchat which runs an application with Google’s Cloud infrastructure and LinkedIn is using Google Search Appliance. New Google apps customers include Pearson, Keller Williams Realty and the city of Boston. And HP is now Google apps reseller combining Google’s software with HP’s hardware for an initiative to help small businesses called SMB IT in a Box.
To conclude, across our entire business we’re investing with enthusiasm and have tremendous opportunities. We strongly believe that we’re making the right moves to our users and clients and we’re extremely optimistic about the future.
With that let me hand back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. So Jamie, if you want to give us the instructions please to get going on the Q&A please. I’d appreciate it.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
All right, great. Thanks, guys. Nikesh, I just had one kind of high level question on enhanced campaigns and the transition. So, can you just give us a little bit more color about the ROIs that most of your customers are seeing? You mentioned a few comments but are there going up? And do you see a significant opportunity in providing conversion tracking across different screens? What do you think will happen with search budgets if and when you can solve that problem? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you for the question. I think it's fair to say that over the last nine months, we've had to do a super Herculean task to take millions and millions of campaigns, as Larry mentioned, 6 million campaigns that we've had to work with our advertising partners to go ahead and convert them towards enhanced campaigns. And we've had some amazing insights both working with the advertisers and as well as our teams. As many advertisers have discovered that there were not addressing the mobile opportunity appropriately, they discovered new inventory, they discovered better ROI and better conversion. Of course we had disobeyed the conversion analytics who work across every scheme and be able to be made available to all of our advertisers. So, we believe that as we get more and more – as we get better in terms of being able to provide more targeting and more comprehensive ad solutions for mobility and across all screens that the ROI should continue to improve. So, I'm very optimistic in the longer term because we believe mobility provides more context to advertisers in terms of where the users are, where they've been, which will allow for more accurate advertising which is almost like as good as information for them. So if that begins to happen we think the advertising ROI continues to increase and hopefully that means good things for search budgets.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Ross, for your question. Jamie, let's go to the next question.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital Inc.
One question for Larry and one for Patrick. Larry, when you think about hardware, are there other hardware categories beyond just phones and tablets where you believe Google can potentially build meaningful businesses? And then Patrick, in Q1 we didn't really see the usual uptick in expenses that you kind of see annually but then now we do see it in Q2. It sounds like some of that was the accounting issue around depreciation, but can you help us understand what happened there more? Thanks.
Larry Page
Yeah, thanks Ben for the question. I think we've been an early innovator in smartphones and we've been really excited about starting Android when no one really thought it was going to be interesting. And I think it's always a mistake to assume that technology will be static. So I think assuming over the long term, we're going to have new kinds of devices and ways of interacting with computing and the internet. Obviously, we're excited about Google Glass and new ways of interacting with hardware and new types of hardware. With any technological change you probably overestimate the short term and underestimate the long term. So I think we're really excited about making those investments. We're making sure we're positioned to live the future and that's why I won't be using Glass because I feel like every time I'm using Glass, I'm living that future. That's really, really exciting to me.
Patrick Pichette
Why don't I jump on the next question, so on the issue of expenses, look our expenses in Q2 were completely in line with the objectives we set for ourselves. In general, we continue to exercise financial discipline and module our product profitability. But it's on that basis that we recognize the significant opportunities that are ahead of us. And with the view to the long term, we continue to invest significantly and intelligently to fuel these opportunities. The fundamental issue is as I've said a number of times on previous calls if you want to hire X amount of people you have a target for the quarter or for the year. And they come in sometimes a bit over, sometimes a bit under but the real question is, are you still on the right trajectory for the long-term you're shooting for. So that's really the issue between Q1 and Q2.
Nikesh Arora
Ben, thank you for your question. Why don't we go to the next question, Jamie?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Two questions, please. First on CPC, Patrick, you mentioned a couple of factors behind the deflation there. I don't think you ticked off mobile. I don't know if there's any particular reason why you didn't or maybe I missed it. And then in terms of the employee adds, maybe a question for Larry as you think about where you've been able to get employees, the ease or the difficulty with which you've been able to hire the employees that you wanted to hire. Could you comment on how that has changed, if at all, over the last year or two? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So why don't I jump in on the first one. Clearly mobile has some effect of it and we've talked about that in the past, so it's just one of the many factors that are at work. I just gave the list and the property mix obviously and the channel mixes includes a bunch of mobile shifts as well and that's part of the equation clearly for sure that drives both sides of the equation. And I just want to remind everybody that it's always kind of dangerous to just look at CPCs by themselves or just look at paid clicks by themselves, but in fact it's a combination of the two that gives you the health of the business and these mixes move all over the place depending on the number of changes going on in any quarter, but overall very pleased with the overall performance. On headcount, I'll lend it to Larry to jump in.
Larry Page
Yeah, Mark, I don't think we've seen any significant change in the short term on hiring. I think we're lucky that we have really great people in the company and more great people want to work with us. We've been able to buy smart companies too where we get great people and I don't see any major changes now that's been changing. I also think retention for the company has been great. People are excited to work here. They're excited to work on important things and make the world better. We're able to hire some of the best people in the world and I think that's been continuing and it's pretty stable.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you for the question, Mark. Jamie, let's go to the next question please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you. Two questions. Larry, I think sometimes you say the technology has done only 1% of what you can do suggesting that there's a lot of opportunity for Google. If that's the case, why isn't your ROE budget 10%, 20% or materially higher than today or in other words what limit your ability to spend more to capture these opportunities? Secondly, Patrick, can you tell us in general what specific financial operating metrics you use to evaluate the success of Google Fiber as a business? Thank you.
Larry Page
Yeah, that's a really great question, Carlos. I think that's our main job is to figure out how to obviously invest more to achieve greater outcomes for the world for the company and so on, and I think those opportunities are clearly there. You know as we've seen in the past with things like Chrome and Android and I've talked about them a lot. I think that execution and velocity, I talked about a lot too. It's pretty easy to come up with ideas, it's pretty hard to make them real and get them to billions of people. And that for me it's so exciting about being at a company like Google, so we get to do technological innovation at scale and get it out to on the scale of the whole world, to billions of people. But I wish we can just snap our fingers and accomplish that. There's actually lot of hard work and it takes a lot of great people working really hard to make that happen. We're working every day to improve our processes, improve our leadership and improve how we're organized, and to make that all go faster, and that's why I'm come into work excited every day and I think why we're most proud of it. I wish we could snap our fingers and do – just do a tremendous amount more instantly, but throughout its hard work to scale and that's what we do.
Patrick Pichette
Carlos, I'll take the second one related to Google Fiber. Just out of the context for everybody, we have been on the record to say that we're running Google Fiber and excited about it and we'll always have profitability as one of the key criteria for this opportunity. And in terms of kind of metrics, they should be just aligned with any sound business that's in that domain of access which is a combination. At first actually it was interesting because the question was, how successful was going to be the product and then – so meaning how many people would kind of want to take it? And then the second – we've been obviously very pleased by our results in Kansas City and now the announcements of the other two cities we've made since then. And then there's all the regular metrics you can imagine which have to do with cost of infrastructure, cost to serve and then how they grow into a profitability model. So there's no real rocket science in the financials of it. The real kind of magic occurs with the definition of the product, the innovation on the technology that the teams are pushing and what makes Google Fiber 100 times faster than the next best thing. That's really what we're really focused on. So I hope that answers your question.
And let's go to the next question, Jamie.
Operator
We'll go next to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask about the network sites deceleration that you saw a 12% growth last quarter and 7% growth this quarter. Can you just talk about some of the key drivers there and perhaps how much is self inflicted as you’re sort of cleaning up more of the sites and quality in everything. And then secondly, can you talk about the key drivers that you see in terms of improving conversion rates for mobile ads, I know you mentioned the conversion analytics, but what else do you think gets mobile ad conversion up over the next few years? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Yeah, so for the first part, I’ll answer the first part of the question Doug, and then Nikesh will answer the second part. Clearly the network deceleration, I mean that’s why we kind of made the comment last quarter about the DLA and policies and it's clearly having an impact as now we’ve had a number of partners that have through Q1, Q2 have all been notified and have made the changes to their behavior. So these policies are now coming into compliance and as a result of it, right that you see the impact. But we really believe that this is a really good thing for our users. And into the long-term it will really benefit both the users at Google, so that’s the core elements of what's going on there. And then for the second question I’ll let Nikesh jump in.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, thank you Patrick. I think it's important to understand as I said that improving convergent rates for us requires us to do a lot of things. One is we have to understand the cross device behavior better. We have to understand the cross device convergent being build. People can start to search in one device and conclude it in another device. These opportunities did not exist in the past and would also focus on one screen. In addition to that, as we talk about mobility we start to understand the context of the users a lot better as I said. Where are they? Where have they been? What could their search possibly mean, when they’re searching for, when you’re in a car parking lot you’re searching for other car dealership that gives us a very different signal than if you’re sitting at your desk and searching for a car. So all those attributes, all those factors need to go in into creating better targeting, better advertising for our end users so that, that actually helps to increase our line for advertisers and hopefully ROI for us in the longer term.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question, Doug. Jamie, lets go to our next question please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Hi, I had two questions. First, Larry mentioned some of the new features in the maps update, I think also the Gmail tab update seems like it's been pushed to users now. It’ll be great to know if you could share the timeline just for the full rollout in the U.S. internationally and any implications you foresee that update may have on those that are relying on marketing as a distribution channel. And then secondly, Larry also spoke about balloon deployed internet access. I was wondering if you could talk about another initiative that seems like it has significant opportunity long-term, the automated vehicle opportunity and when you think of that as a commercial opportunity at scale. Thanks.
Larry Page
Yeah, thanks for that question Scott, I think -- I am not sure the detail of the Gmail rollout. I’ve been excited to use it and I think it's a really great experience. I think we’re doing a lot to improve peoples experience on Gmail. I’m not sure we have a huge number of users on Gmail that’s growing quickly and we’re really, really excited about it. And obviously there’s some things around email experience that can be improved and we’re doing a lot to organize commercial offers and things like that, make sure that you’re not getting overwhelmed by spam and so on. And I think those have been great very user positive features enrolling out. I think in terms of automated cars I mean I think again that’s a very early stage thing. I think I’m very excited about it. I think it has potential again to have tremendous impact on people’s lives on our mobility and so on. And I think nothing has changed about that, we’re super excited about it and working hard it's very early stage project obviously. And then there is the last part of your question, I mean I think it's hard to predict exactly when these things will be commercial. My question I always ask is, why aren’t you doing it today? So we try to reduce whatever roadblocks that we can, take anything out as quickly as possible and I think now I think there’s great opportunity there.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you for your question Scott. Jamie, lets go to our next question please.

And we’ll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.
Anthony DiClemente - Barclays
Hi, thanks. I’ve one for Patrick and one for Larry. Patrick, I just wanted to ask about CapEx. I think you mentioned in your comments that data centers and other network infrastructure was lumpy and responsible for the doubling of CapEx. I am just wondering, I am not sure from an accounting perspective what the useful light is on some of those investments and whether or not the amortization of those assets is part of what's causing a little bit of the uplift in operating expenses. So we’ll love to hear a little more about CapEx. And then, Larry as Google continues to invest for future growth, I just wanted to ask, how do you as a leader of the Company ensure that the people at Google and your employees keep the kind of small entrepreneurial culture that Google had and was known for in its earlier days. And thanks a lot for the question.
Patrick Pichette
So let me jump in Anthony on the first part and then I’ll let Larry answer the second. We don’t give the details of the different categories of depreciation by for our assets. But you can imagine that as we build these, the data centers and the computers clearly data centers have a long lifetime because if you think of them as land, electricity, power, building shelves, like cooling towers, all that technology has much longer useful life. And then the computers themselves, the machines, the servers have a much shorter lifetime and we track all those by categories obviously. And clearly there is a relationships between that and our depreciation rates that have been -- between that and that’s been climbing over the last few quarters. But there’s nothing magical about it as well. I mean it's just basically, what you’d expect by category. On the second question, I’ll let Larry answer.
Larry Page
Yeah, it's a great question I think. I think I am very, very exited to see. I mentioned the Project Loon or the automated cars, I think a lot of us are making sure that our employees and Google as a Company has the permission to do important things, and those things always start with a small group of people. They’d start with one or two people and then 10 people and so on, and those people can get a lot of things done. So I think probably I’ll measure out the Company in that way is we’re able to start up new and important things and make traction on them, and that’s the only way we end up with things like Android and Chrome those were once those kind of projects. So, I look at it kind of a portfolio thing. For some number of people that like to work on crazy things that are going to really change the world and want to deal with 10 other trends and work hard on them and kind of make sure we’re creating those opportunities and growing them into things that become Gmail or Android or Chrome, lot of things like that. And so I kind of look at it across the portfolio and I think we’re doing quite well and I’m pretty excited about it.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you for your question Anthony. Jamie, lets go to our next question please.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Mark May with Citigroup.
Mark May - Citigroup
Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, I’m wondering there was an expectation I think starting this quarter that we’d start to see some of the impact of enhanced campaigns and obviously you’re seeing great adoption of that and that adoption and the impact that, that might have on blended prices might offset these mix factors that you referenced. I wonder if you could help walk us through why that wasn’t the case necessarily in this quarter. And then secondly probably for Patrick, I wonder can you help estimate the impact on the network growth in the quarter from the quality improvement initiatives and are these issues that might impact future quarters or was this mainly a first half of this year kind of impact?
Larry Page
Yes, that’s a great question. I will also say maybe one sentence and turn it over to the other guys. I think it's important to keep in mind like enhanced campaigns are the largest change we made in AdWords ever, and it was done pretty quickly, and so I think we’re still very, very early stages with that. We changed tremendous amounts for how our teams operate, how our advertisers operate, how everyone buys those ads, what the users see, and we’ve done it pretty well. It's been pretty smooth which I’m really excited about. But, like I said that’s the early stages of a very, very major change. I think we’re very pleased with how that’s going.
Patrick Pichette
That’s very much so, and so on the second part of your question, Mark I think with the quality -- the forceful quality around our policies, I mean they will take a year to flow through. I mean once you've kind of reset the bar then it actually – by the time people have kind of adhered to these new changes but then you have to actually navigate through the entire year-over-year effects which will probably take a couple more quarters. And that's just a timing issue. Having said that, I just want to remind everybody again that the fundamental issue that we see is its really important for us to actually have a great user experience. And Susan and her team's kind of pounded this by making changes on a constant basis to make sure that at the end of the day there is that [smart bout], the quality of the user experience and the quality of the ads because in the end that's what really drives the benefit in the long term. So, when we have to hit – take some hits in the short term in order to actually get the right answer in the long term for our users and our advertisers, we're always ready to do them and that's a great example of it. So, we're actually not too worried about it. We have so many other areas that we just talked about enhanced campaigns, CLAs and so many other areas that offers us kind of opportunities that we just got to keep this in balance.
Thank you for your question, Mark. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to follow-up on enhanced campaigns. One of the questions people are trying to get at is was there any impact from enhanced campaigns on paid clicks and CPCs in the quarter that you can try and help us calibrate? And then I guess the other question would be given obviously it is still new and broad roll out this quarter, how many quarters do you think this needs to be in place for you to have a good sense of the impact that might have on those metrics? And then – sorry, then my last question was anything related to the impact on FX related to CPCs? I didn't think I heard that. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora
Hi, Heather. This is Nikesh. Thank you for your question. I think and let me step back and say first of all it's as Larry mentioned and Patrick mentioned, it is an existential requirement for us to take out advertisers and move them to a campaign strategy which allows us to move them across multiple streams. So this wasn't something that is just a remedy imperative, it's an imperative from a simplicity perspective, from an advertiser return perspective and also from the way our teams operate. So, we have spent the last six months migrating over 6 million campaigns, as I mentioned, and we'll probably be done by the end of this month which is not too far away. As you can imagine that we've been focusing and moving these things across the board, so we're still looking at the full impact since the impact has sort of graduated over the last few months. Now in terms of what the impact of this should be in the longer term, as I mentioned earlier the impact in the longer term should be that we should be able to provide simpler, faster, better ads to our advertisers across multiple streams. In terms of when you should be able to see effects of these things, now obviously there are effects that we see and we monitor and we take a look at, but it's for us to go out and start detailing what the impact these things are. But of course in the long term, it should have a positive impact on conversions and as a result all resulting metrics that affect conversion.
Patrick Pichette
Heather, I'll just jump on your very last question about FX related to CPCs. As I said in my comments, there's actually a marginal effect. I mean FX was not a big factor this quarter. I mean it has been a little bit for the UK as I mentioned but for the rest of the world, it has not been a major impact for the CPC issue.
Thank you for your questions, Heather. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. Patrick, the gross profit growth has been trailing revenue growth. I think it was about 14% this quarter for about three quarters especially. Can you talk about what's really kind of drove the step down last year in 3Q? And is there any way to see that gap close and do you use gross profit as a measure or do you look more at revenue growth? Some of the drivers of the difference will be really helpful. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Justin. Again, a topic that's for financial analysts have been always kind of top of mind. I just want to kind of reiterate kind of some of the basic messages that have not changed and how we think about this. So first of all, we care about revenue growth, we care about profitability, we care about both. And I've said this before, right, we're not in a business to lose money, cross subsidize or any of these things. So regarding margins we really look at every incremental profit dollar that creates shareholder value and really focused on these profit dollars rather than the percentage margins. Many of the new opportunities that we may be exploring whether it be hardware, whether it be Play, whether it be – many of these will have different margins in our core business, but they actually offer great kind of – huge revenue pools, huge margin pools in absolute dollars and then create much shareholder value and in many cases with Larry and the product area leads, great synergistic value between the products to create this great experiences. So, that's basically the mindset that we apply at it and we track them independently and together and make sure that we actually deliver continued revenue growth and profit growth. So that's the mindset which we apply. And don't read in my comment that we're not focused on our core business. It remains our core business. The core is the core is the core, and it continues to give us both revenue and oxygen profits to kind of fuel our growth as well. So that's the balanced answer to your question.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
If I could follow-up, is there anything in there that maybe operating right now at negative gross margins that is kind of in-transitory in nature?
Patrick Pichette
I wouldn't comment on a specific product by product, but it's clear that if there are timing issues, if there's a product that actually isn't in investment mode, right, and at the beginning of its investment curves, you know that you're actually investing in it for the timing of future profits. We do that too. I mean you can imagine our very first customer in Kansas City, right. The P&L for that day was negative, but that's not why we did Kansas City, right. We did Kansas City because we know as a city was going to be very profitable, so there is clearly products that have because of the timing investment movements that actually show – will show negative, but not because we want them to be negative just because of where they are during investment phase. So that's how we think about it.
Thank you for your question. Jamie, let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Brian Pitz from Jefferies.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies & Co.
Thanks. Nikesh, you briefly mentioned PLAs. We continue to see that format in Search and recently we noticed integrated deals and offers into that format, any additional color on the impact from PLAs in the quarter? And then Larry, regarding product search, I guess more broadly, do you think users will be able to purchase items without ever leaving the Search results page at some point? Thank so much.
Larry Page
Thanks, Brian. I'll take the second question first. I think to the extent and obviously we can streamline the process of doing transactions or fulfilling any task and that's a good thing. I think in the trial we are doing in the Bay Area with [same day] delivery you can buy things very easily and get them delivered in a couple of hours. That was a pretty great experience. So we definitely look at any ways we can find to really improve our user's experience. Nikesh, do you want to take over the PLA part?
Nikesh Arora
As Larry mentioned, we are trying to get the user experience to be better and better. And as we've talked in the past, things are moving from 10 blue links to entity level search where people are searching for specific entities and they expect a response as a specific entity when doing that search. So think about PLA in the broader context, that when people search for something they like to get the answer. And if it's a product they're searching for, of course PLA has satisfied that requirement. So we are signing up tens of thousands of merchants who want to share that data with us, who want to make that data visible as part of Google Search. So we think this is a good thing. Again, as we provide more and more PLA information, obviously it has an impact on peoples clicking on those links. So in the long term that should have a positive impact on fixers on various ad formats, but for now it's too early to talk about the impact of those with the overall numbers that we have.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you for your question, Brian. Jamie, let's go to our next question. We have time for a couple more.
Operator
We'll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Good afternoon. A question on Motorola X, I know you haven't said a ton about it but there has been some talk that you're going to be aggressively marketing that. Can you just talk a little bit about this relationship that you have between having the Motorola X phone be enough of a success that you make a statement but not enough of a success that you end up corrupting or impacting your Android partners, so talk about that relationship? Thanks.
Larry Page
Thanks for the question, Gene. I think nothing about what we've said has changed and we operate Motorola independently. As you can see in the level of work that's going on there to operating that business, I think teams are doing a great job as we mentioned. I think they're working hard on making a great product. And I think we're really excited about it. I think they're excited about it and obviously you'll get to try it out pretty soon.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Do you feel that the – I mean the incremental investment, is it going to be – it's been rumored to be $500 million, is it something in that range?
Larry Page
Are you talking about I guess the people have been speculating about marketing and so on. And I think that obviously we’re going to – we’re operating Motorola independently, running it much the same way we would run any business like that and I think we’re doing things that are normal for that business. I think probably too much has been the made over those things.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks Gene for your question. Okay, we have time for one more question. So Jamie can you give us the last question please?
Operator
Thank you. We will take our final question from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.
Richard Kramer - Arete Research
Thanks. Thanks very much. One for Larry and one for Patrick. For Larry, given the recent launch of YouTube subscriptions and also music services, how widely do you see Google expanding into subscription base businesses in the future and do you see this in three to five years is something that would be a meaningfully sized segment that would drive all network in size for example.
And for Patrick, since you had some questions about Motorola being excited about, it is nice. But the business has lost nearly a $1 billion on a GAAP basis in the last three quarters. So, can you give us some sort of time scale for achieving returns here and I know you mentioned, you’re just looking for absolute profit dollars. But what’s the ultimate aim from Motorola in terms of contributing to Google’s profit base or even just to distribute more widely Google services? Thanks.
Larry Page
That’s the question about subscription services. I mean, I think like we said, we’re really excited about the play, music subscription being really well received, I love using it. I think we are always looking for ways to meet our users needs better and obviously subscriptions are one way to do that. So I’m sure over time we will try to meet our users needs better and have our products in that area. I don’t have anything to announce this time there. On the Motorola question, Patrick you want to take down?
Patrick Pichette
Sure. I think the Motorola question has to be put into context of two things. One is while we originally paid for Motorola and all the assets we acquired and the benefits, we got out of that acquisition because there wasn’t only a short-term financial play that was the number of strategic issues. We are very pleased with the divestiture of the home business, which kind of generally quite a bit of cash over the last, in Q2. So, I think that you have to put this conversation in the context of the entire acquisition for which we were really pleased and we also are incredibly proud of what the team has accomplished in the last year. And having now kind of create this great entity under Dennis, who has now kind of lean and mean with 5,000 employees focused on the future and that with the pounding away at next generation of products. So, I will leave it to the coming quarters to kind of really demonstrate the kind of new Motorola that’s showing up and you will see that in the coming weeks actually. Larry, any last comments before we close?
Larry Page
I want to thank everyone for spending so much time with us today. And we will see you on next quarter.

We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Page
Hi, everyone, thank you for joining us. It’s great to be on the call this afternoon. If you’re listening online, I hope you liked our warm-up video. I heard they had a great time making it. Okay, we had a really strong start to 2013, with Q1 revenue up 31% year-on-year to $14 billion. I want to give a big shout-out to the sales teams that made this all possible. We tend to focus on product and engineering, but our business organization is tremendously strong. They are Google’s unsung heroes.
Over the last two years, we worked hard to increase our velocity, improve our execution, and focus on the big bets that will make a difference in the world. Take Google now, our goal is to get you the right information at just the right time. Launched nine months ago, Now provides boarding passes, delivery updates, and traffic conditions without you having to ask first. In this quarter, we added movie tickets nicely packaged with directions to the theatre. I am also excited about our Voice Search momentum. Looking for the nearest pharmacy, just ask Google for directions, and we’ll deliver them instantly, no typing needed. And you can now ask conversational questions like do I need a jacket this weekend. Voice commands are going to be increasingly important, it's just much less hassle to talk than type.
So in this quarter, we launched Chrome support for Web Speech APIs. Developers can now easily add voice recognition into their web apps. We expect to see a lot of innovation there. The velocity around Google Play is tremendous. It’s a big bet and one that’s fundamental to the success of the Android ecosystem. In our first year, we assigned partnerships with all major movie studios, music labels, and publishers, and our digital content is available in over 20 countries globally, seven of which we launched in Q1, including India and Mexico.
And last week, we released a beautiful new UI with better recommendations, bigger images, and a simpler way to buy things. Play is already a great product and we are improving it at a rapid rate. As devices multiply, it’s really important that our products work seamlessly whatever device you are using at the moment. It's why I love Google Play, the ability to buy books, apps, movies or songs and have them instantly available on your Android devices even when you buy it on the web. When you switch devices while reading, your book opens exactly where you left off. In the same way, we need to make advertising across devices really simple for our customers. Online advertising has developed in a very device specific ways with separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This makes arduous work for advertisers and agencies, and means mobile opportunities often get missed.
So in February, we launched Enhanced Campaigns, a significant upgrade to AdWords. Nikesh will talk more about that in a moment. But our goal is simple; to enable advertisers to focus on their audience and their message while we dynamically adapt their campaigns across multiple devices. I've been very pleased with the rate of progress so far. We are smoothly moving a huge advertising system and ecosystem on a dime.
In today's multi-screen world, the opportunities are endless. Think about your device. Battery life is a challenge for most people. You shouldn’t need to carry around a charger with you to make it through the day. If your kids spill their drink on their tablet, the screen shouldn't die, and when you drop your phone it shouldn't shatter. There is a real potential to invent new and better experiences, one that are much faster and more intuitive, so having just seen Motorola’s upcoming products myself. I’m really excited about the potential there. In just under a year, they have accomplished a lot and have impressive velocity and execution.
I want to finish up by talking a little bit about the future. We invest the vast majority of our resources and time in our core products as well as our big bets like Chrome, YouTube and Android, but as CEO it’s also super important to keep focused on the future. Companies tend to get comfortable doing what they’ve always done with a few minor tweaks. It’s only natural to want to work on other things you know, but incremental improvement is guaranteed to be obsolete over time, especially in technology, where history has shown that there is a lot of revolutionary change.
So a big part of my job is to get people focused on things that are not just incremental. Take Gmail, when we released that, we were a search company. It was a leap for us to put out an e-mail product let alone one that gave users 100 times as much storage as anyone else. It was the same with Android, and that’s why we’re investing in what appears to be speculative projects to you today such as self-driving cars.
We found that with ambitious goals and a committed team you can make progress pretty quickly. The best people often want to work on the biggest bets and there’s not much competition, because no one else is crazy enough to try.
We started Google Fiber because Sergey thought it will be great to show how high speed Internet access can improve people’s lives. Three years later, our first homes are live in Kansas City, and in the last two weeks, we have announced plans to roll out service in Austin and Provo.
And just this week, after three years of development, we started handing over Glass devices to developers. I get chills when I use a product that is the future, and that happens when I use Glass. Someday, we will all be amazed [that computing involved] [ph] fishing around in pockets and purses.
There are so many opportunities in the world to create technology that makes people’s lives better. We are still only at 1% of what’s possible; we are really just getting started. And that is why I am so excited to be here working hard with Googlers to take our company to the next level. Thank you.
And now, I’ll turn the call over to Patrick for some detail.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. So let me dive in by reviewing the details of our overall business financial performance. So here we go.
Our total gross consolidated revenue grew 31% year-over-year to $14 billion in Q1. The overall business was down 3% quarter-over-quarter driven by the softness in Motorola Mobility segment specifically.
Were it not for currency fluctuations, our consolidated revenue would have grown 33% year-over-year or an additional $96 million, but the quarter-over-quarter impact was really immaterial. Google standalone gross revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $13 billion and was flat quarter-over-quarter. Google website revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $8.6 billion flat quarter-over-quarter with strength across most major geographies and industries.
Google network revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $3.3 billion and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter impact was largely due to the effect of advertising policy decisions implemented during Q4 and in Q1 as well. Other revenue grew 150% year-year-over to $1 billion and 27% quarter-over-quarter driven by Play store sales, which also includes both hardware and digital commerce sales.
It’s worth noting that a significant part of the sequential other revenue growth is due to the implementation of an accounting change in our Play app revenue recognition policy. Currency fluctuations had an immaterial impact of Google standalone revenue both year-year-over and quarter-over-quarter.
Turning now to Motorola Mobility, gross revenue was $1 billion. We continue to be very pleased with the velocity of change at Motorola as Larry mentioned. For example, this week we closed our sale of the Home business, as well as the Flextronics outsourcing agreement. We’re seeing a lot of progress across the board in the transformation of the Motorola Mobility. We’re excited about the future, but I wish to remind everyone that results from that segment will continue to be variable.
At Google, global aggregate paid click growth was strong, was up 20% year-over-year and, in fact, up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 4% year-over-year, as well as down 4% quarter-over-quarter. Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. And similar to last quarter, as I mentioned, the advertising policy change affecting network revenue continue to lower the aggregate paid click growth and improve CPC growth on a year-over-year basis.
In addition, our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by the usual factors that I’ve covered many times including geomix, channel mix, property mix and product changes.
Turning now to geography and our geographic performance of Google standalone business, we continue to see steady performance across the U.S., the U.K. and the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you’ll find in our investor relations website, you’ll see that we’ve broken down our revenue by U.S. U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
Revenue was up, from the U.S., was up 20% year-over-year to $5.8 billion. The U.K. was up 21% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, which include $20 million of benefits from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the U.K. actually grew 20%.
Non-U.S. revenue excluding U.K. accounted for 44% of our total revenue or $5.7 billion, up 24% year-over-year, which includes a $15 million benefit from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of world in fact grew 27%. So coming back at an aggregate level for total consolidated business, other cost of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1, excluding stock based compensation and Motorola restructuring.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $3.9 billion, which also exclude our stock based compensation and Motorola restructuring. And our non-GAAP operating profit was $4.2 billion in Q1 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 30%.
For standalone Google, traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 25% of total advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $2.1 billion excluding $99 million of stock-based compensation. The year-year-over increase was primarily driven by equipment cost including costs associated with the hardware sales on Play, carrier OEM revenue share driven by the implementation of our accounting change in our Play app revenue recognition policy that I mentioned a minute ago and content acquisition costs.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.5 billion excluding stock-based compensation of $556 million in this case and non-GAAP operating profit was strong at $4.4 billion in Q1 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the Google segment of 34% for standalone. Lastly, depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment for standalone Google was $520 million for this quarter.
At Motorola Mobility, our total non-GAAP operating expenses including cost to revenues were $1.2 billion. And keep in mind that intangible amortization of expenses attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola Mobility are in fact, included in these non-GAAP measures. Of the $315 million in intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola of which $116 million was allocated to Google and $37 million was allocated to Motorola Mobility.
And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss for Motorola Mobility was $179 million in Q1 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of negative 18% for that segment. Let me turn to head count for the consolidated business. In fact, it was roughly flat for Q1. Keep in mind, the consolidated head count includes the Motorola Home and Home comprise roughly one-third of the total Motorola head count. Standalone Google added about 1,200 people and in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter around 53,900 full-time employees. Many of you may have noticed our effective tax rate that was very low at 8% in Q1.
Please note that this quarter, the rate reflects a recognition for the full-year benefit of our 2012 federal R&D tax credit, which Congress extended, but only retroactively in January of this year, so there was a catchup for the full of 2012 in Q1. Additionally, there has been the usual mix shift of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries that continue to impact our tax rate.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $134 million, which reflects interest income and realized gains on investments offset by the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense from our hedging program. For more details on those or any again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $3.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $1.2 billion versus last quarter at $1 billion and the majority of CapEx spend was related to production equipment, data center construction, and facilities related purchases. Our free cash flow was also strong at $2.4 billion and please note that cash flow and CapEx both include the Home business for now.
And before I hand it off now to Nikesh, I want to say a few words about investing in our future and preparing for the growth of our businesses. The success of our products and our continued strong performance as portrayed by Larry’s comments, continued support, our optimism, and our confidence to continue to funding the strategic growth areas. These include not only products like Search or YouTube and Android or Chrome, but also our infrastructure as well.
With that, I’ll hand it off to Nikesh who will cover in more details, our business performance in the quarter. And after his remarks, we’ll open up the phone for questions. Nikesh, all yours.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. Our business is continuing to perform well. We had over $13 billion in Google standalone gross revenue. Our core business is strong across Search and Display including the continued rise of Mobile. I’m particularly pleased by the positive growth we have continued to achieve in Display. Let’s review a few key highlights for the quarter before we talk in more depth about multi-screens, which Larry alluded to in bad advertising momentum.
From a regional perspective, growth was fairly stable across the board this quarter. Asia continues to be our fastest growing region, Southern Europe remains stable despite the continued economic woes in the region. Auto has been a strong sector for us globally and the cold spring in the U.K. has lead to stronger growth in the retail sector there.
Our shopping business continues to expand with over 1 billion products listed. This quarter, we rolled out product listing ads in Europe and also brought them to mobile devices. I want to mention our policy efforts that ensure that we're working with only the highest quality partners, which Patrick has already alluded to. We want to make sure we protect users from having bad experiences with websites and online services. So we’ve tightened our policies and enforcement in few areas like downloadable software applications. While these steps may impact network revenue in the short-term, they're essential in the long-term for a better, safer web experience for users and to encourage brands to invest more in online marketing and in our network. We strongly believe what we've done benefits us in the long-term.
Shifting gears to our Enterprise business, the Enterprise business continues to experience strong growth, across pretty much all products, regions and industries. While our SMB segment is growing steadily, we're seeing significant increase from large global organizations, in fact 58% of the Fortune 500 are now actively using abate enterprise cloud product from Google.
Recent wins include ANA from Japan, the largest airline, Woolworths with over 200,000 users, Australia’s largest retailer, BMW, it will use Google Places and Street View in their ultimate driving machines and the Country of Malaysia, they are adopting Google Apps for 10 million students, teachers and parents. They are going to deploy Chromebooks to primary and secondary schools nationwide.
Moving on to our marketing efforts, our marketing team continues to execute flawlessly. They have helped Chromebooks increase their footprint in the U.S. expanding to more than 1,000 Best Buy stores nationwide, which pretty much doubles the previous number of stores we had. The Samsung Chromebook has been the top selling laptop in Amazon since it launched. We have rolled out Nexus 4 in Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and expanded in the U.S. to 3,000 T-Mobile stores.
I want to focus the rest of my remarks on two continuing trends that present great opportunities for us. First, the shift to consumers to a multi-screen lifestyle and second, the ongoing movement of brand dollars online.
As Larry has said, consumers are accessing content interchangeably on many screens throughout the day. Our clients are hungry to advertise where consumers are. In fact, 95% of our clients have campaigns that run across multiple screens.
In February, working with Susan and Sridhar team we rolled out enhanced campaigns to make it easier for clients to manage and measure campaigns that reach people across devices. Market dealers will be able to deliver ads that are more relevant to the users’ context using features like offers and proximity bidding. And they will be able to do a better job of measuring mobile conversions.
Enhanced campaigns is an important long-term bet that will help market tiers. You know this is a big change for many of our advertisers and we’ve invested tremendous amounts of time and effort into making the transition as smooth as possible. In the first two month since launch, more than 1.5 million campaigns have already been upgraded to enhanced campaigns. And these clients are beginning to see great results.
We expect to migrate all campaigns that we manage by the end of the current quarter. While this is a complicated task, it’s a great example of our focus on flawless execution on behalf of our customers. Now on to brands, we see great remarketing success stories everyday. Nissan, Mexico’s biggest launch of the air, the Pathfinder featured 13 video ads and a new approach to remarketing AdWords of video.
Nissan connected their stories of making sure that users who watch their videos were shown a new one each time. Newer brand-friendly formats like our expandable Lifebox ads, our Reserve inventory solution are helping clients create beautiful experience with sight, sound, and motion. Over the past year, the number of advertisers using our Google Display Network Reserve option has increased four-fold.
Now, we have two-thirds of the top 100 Ad Age brands using those products. This is really helpful in developing deep partnership with our clients especially in the branding arena. For example, we’re now working directly with Adidas in Germany on the new global branding budget. Brands are also continuing to see the power of YouTube to help them reach consumers across the screens.
Today, more than a billion people are finding the channels they love on YouTube every month. Users are now watching over 50 million more hours a day compared to a year ago of 50% increase.
We had a record year for our Super Bowl Ad Blitz program views, votes, watch time and advertiser participation were all up from last year. We saw increased engagement across all screens. We had 1.3 million total hours of watch time of commercials on Ad Blitz, that’s equivalent to the length of 325,000 Super Bowls. More brands are also using YouTube as a strategic part of their campaign to reach the younger generation.
For example, Chevrolet built awareness of the Chevy Sonic, but made for digital videos supported by YouTube and Google Ads, all contributing to successful launch of this all-new sub-compact car.
Our work in brands also helps our publisher partners, our Ad Exchange supports all formats, all screens, and hundreds of publishers and continuing to grow well. We are offering new solutions for publishers like Google Consumer Surveys and Google Play to help them make money from their content.
In conclusion, I want to thank all Googlers who helped deliver a great quarter into our business. This industry is moving very fast and the opportunities are numerous. We’re lucky to have such skilled and hardworking employees to help drive Google and our partners in the future. With that, thank you Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. Sean, if you don’t mind, we’ll start the Q&A section now. So I’ll ask you to give us the instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Absolutely, thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.
Mark Mahaney – RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, two questions please. First, Patrick, you mentioned this accounting change that I – could you just give us a little bit more detail on what that accounting change was versus Play? And then could you talk about the TAC trends? I know it’s just one part of your business, but you seem to be moving in different directions on your own sites, continuing to rise pretty dramatically, but on your network partner sites, falling off pretty significantly. Can you just help us think about what that should look like going forward for both of those segments? Thanks a lot.
Patrick Pichette
Yeah, thank you for your question, Mark. Let’s take them in row. First on the apps revenue recognition policy, let me explain what happened there, and I’ll use it with an example if you don’t mind. If you – and the way we did it is, we changed the revenue recognition. So if you say, you buy an app for $1 on the PlayStore, $0.70 of that dollar will be paid to the developer and does not impact on P&L, it didn’t before and it still doesn’t today. So that hasn’t changed.
In the past though, we would have booked the remaining $0.30 on a net of payments to carriers and OEM and then booked that as gross revenue. Beginning in Q1, however, the entire $0.30 is now booked as gross and the payments for the carriers and the OEMs are now booked on other cost of revenue. So that’s the big change that has happened and basically the reason why we did this is as part, we were looking to the second half of 2012, we were seeing these used to be kind of immaterial numbers for us. And then when we saw through the second half of 2012, we decided to kind of tune our accounting policies and made that change in Q1. So that’s the issue what’s going on the revenue recognition. So you’ll see the impact both on gross and then as I said on other cost of revenue and then you get the net. So on a net basis, it doesn't change.
On the TAC issue that you’ve raised, Mark, the answer is pretty simple, right? If TAC is dropped overall, because of the change in our ad policies that we’ve done through Q4 and Q1, so in pushing hard on implementation of our ad policies to the benefit of the user, the impact of that is actually that it lowered our network revenue, but it also lowered our TAC, which is tied to AdSense partners in that role.
On Google sites, you have noticed that it continues to grow, and it grows because of mobile growth. So the volume of mobile in our mix is driving TAC to go up. So, overall TAC is down for the quarter as an aggregate basis. The ad policy changes have driven them down and then our mobile for our own sites continue to drive them up. But that’s a good story because it means mobile has really continued to be on fire. So that’s the pieces of the puzzle. Thanks for your questions because it wasn’t that easy to understand at first. But I hope that clarifies the point. Thank you, Mark. Sean, to our next question please?

Our next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
Ben Schachter – Macquarie Capital Inc.
Larry, in your prepared comments, you spent quite a bit of time discussing the non-core future products. I wonder if you could talk about any changes to the amount of resources being invested in Google X and these products? And also, can you tell us how you determine the appropriate size of the investments in these various teams and products? And then just quickly separately, Knowledge Graph, just in general if you can give us an update on the progress and sort of how you measure that progress internally? Thanks.
Larry Page
Yeah, thanks, Ben for the questions. I feel like every time I say anything I get this question. I think honestly my job as CEO is to get people to do those things. If you look at most companies, they will never do anything different and eventually they run into problems for that reason. So I think that’s the common failure mode. I think the reality is it’s pretty hard to invest significant amounts in new things, because it’s actually difficult to get people to do those things.
So, we have nothing to say differently about our general philosophy of 80% on our core things. I said that in my remarks basically that we’re still focused on our core products and our big bets. And that’s clearly, the vast majority of our resources, and we’ll add resource to the new things as we’re able to and as they show success.
As an investor, I am – I as a big shareholder of Google, I’m certainly not worried about the expense of that because I don’t think like I said it’s not easy to spend that much money on the new things. I’ll be more worried that we don’t do those things fast enough and build on revolutionary change that happens in the technology industries.
On the Knowledge Graph, I think there’s been tremendous progress there, we’ve done internationalization. There’s a quality improvement and we’re improving the kind of questions we can answer as I mentioned about weather and other things that happens from improvements to our Knowledge Graph, and I’m very excited about that. And I think we still have big investments there and you still for a long time will continue to see improved products there. So can we have our next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Anthony DiClemente – Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thank you very much. First question for, Larry, I’m just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on the impact of Facebook Home for Android just given some have talked about the possible impact on engagement with other Android apps. And then secondly, and I guess this would be for anyone who wants to take it, I think investors are just wondering about Enhanced Campaigns that you talked about launching in February. should we expect any sort of bumpiness or any sort of near-term dislocation from your advertisers who are starting to become accustomed to Enhanced Campaigns, on boarding to that platform with the understanding in the long-term opportunity of course? Thanks.
Larry Page
Thanks, Anthony. I’ll take the first question there; maybe, I’ll give the second one to Nikesh. I think that Google is really focused on building and creating great Android experiences within the strong ecosystem that we have. And it’s really great to see developers really focused on and building for Android. So I’ll give Nikesh the second question about The Enhanced Campaigns. But I’m certainly, as I mentioned, I think it’s gone pretty smoothly. I’m pretty excited about it.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, thank you, Anthony. As Larry just said that, it was very complicated. We had to train a sales force around the world and to launch simultaneously and work with our product team. But so far, the feedback we’ve gotten from advertisers is, it is positive, because it basically takes away a lot of work from them and we’ve been able to migrate 1.5 million campaigns to enhanced campaigns. we also have some great suggestions from our advertisers about what we should do to make it better and we’re beginning to implement those. So we’re hoping that towards the end of this quarter, we should have migrated all of the campaigns, which are done separately as mobile and separately the desktop as combined and really offer them the benefits of location, context, screens, all with one campaign. So effectively I think in the long-term that should be better ROI.
Anthony DiClemente – Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, thank you very much.
Nikesh Arora
Sean, why don’t we go to the next question please?
Operator
Absolutely, your next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
Justin Post – BofA Merrill Lynch
Thank you. My question just is the mobile impact on the business, it looks like your top line revenues have somewhat stabilized. But how is the transition to mobile impacting your kind of high level revenue growth over a period of quarters and also your margins, maybe you could give us a little help on that? And then maybe, Larry, could you address the concern that constantly comes up about people using apps versus a Google Search, obviously, the disclosures you’ve given suggest revenue on mobile is going at or above the industry, but are you seeing any pressure from app usage versus search usage on mobile? Thank you.
Larry Page
Yeah, thank you, Justin. I think, maybe, I’ll take the first one, second one first. You know we always get this question about other apps versus Google Search. I think, I am not super concerned about that issue. I think that people use lots of apps on the web over many strong sites and so on. So we’ve been dealing with that issue for a long time. I think fundamentally search is an amazing thing for publishers and software developers and everybody else and we deliver a lot of traffic and lot of users to things and so, I think in general the information wants to be found and we’re working hard to make sure that the user experience is great and that we are delivering people into the right places. So I think I feel pretty confident on that – in the future that we’ll get through that just fine. So the second half of your question?
Patrick Pichette
The first part of the question was about top line Mobile versus other impacts on the business and margins. Let me just jump in on this one quickly, and it’s really about the new reality where we have all the multi-screens. And I mean, Larry talked about this at length at the last earnings call where the reality now is it’s not about mobile or tablets or desktop, it’s about this unified life that you have where you’re always connected and the question is are you giving the best answer all the time following me throughout my day.
And that’s why in fact Enhanced Campaigns is a great signal of that; where you’re saying, hey, let’s find the right ad at the right time and the right answer at the right time for you to during your day. So I think that rather than to ask if you know which small piece part is going to kind of contribute plus or minus, the real question is are we growing the pie of your day with Google and in the long-term are we really kind of contributing to create the best answers both for the advertisers and for users, and that’s really what we’re actually pushing for.
So I think that this trend really presents to us enormous opportunities and when people ask about what’s going on with TAC Patrick or what do you think the impact of CPC on a very specific basis, I think that that’s the wrong way to ask the question. The real right way is the excitement we have about kind of helping you throughout your day on all your devices, right and the pie grows for everybody. And that’s the right way to ask the question. So thanks for your question on that, Justin.
Justin Post – BofA Merrill Lynch

Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
Carlos Kirjner – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thank you for taking my question. I have two. First on Google Fiber, taking aside the user experience for those who get it. How do you expect Fiber to have major impact given that you take many billions and several years to pass, something like 20 million U.S. homes, and after all of that, time and money, you would be at best and mid-sized provider in a market that accounts for less than half of your current business.
Secondly, on the future of Search, Larry you mentioned voice commands in your opening remarks. We already get voice output with Jellybean. Put this together with Google Now and Knowledge Graph and we see our future where you'll get the answer to your question sometimes before you ask it. How do ads come into this view? How do you generate revenues in the world like this where you guys seem to be going to? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Why don't I jump on the first question and I'll let Larry answer the second one. Look, on Fiber, I think it's really simple. It's very early days. We're totally excited about delivering a great user experience with faster than Internet speed. And Gigabit as Larry said with Sergey's kind of quest a few years ago, Gigabit speed over hundred times faster than the average American. I mean, that is a great user experience and it's really about pushing for speed and writing the new chapter, the next chapter of the Internet. So for us I think we really are excited about this and that's really where we're focused on. On the second question, I'll let Larry give his comments.
Larry Page
I'm glad you're very ambitious too, because Fiber industry is not big enough for you so I applaud that. I think, we would love to find businesses much bigger than our entire current business to invest in, but I think there's only a very small number of such companies that even exist. So I think, we look at places where we can provide a lot of – on Fiber we look at places where we can provide products that can make really big difference in peoples' lives and we can make a lot of money and resources doing it. And I think it certainly meets that criteria, although as Patrick said, it's very early days. On the voice pass and knowing what people want before they ask for it and how do we make ads on that, how do we make revenue and ads on network.
I am not worried about that at all, that’s how we’ve been doing this for a long time and in fact, we really view the reason we’ve been successfully doing advertising is we feel that is another source of information, seeing all the search ads that we show has to be very relevant and make sensitive at that moment. And the more – the better job we can do in providing you information even with [with regard you’re] asking for it, the better we can also provide commercial information to you that people are excited about promoting to. And I think that’s actually huge, huge opportunity for us. We are all about making things more efficient, marketing the right information to the right people at the right time and that’s how we’re going to improve in the kind of world that you are talking about. All right, can we have our next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, thanks. I had two please; the first one for Nikesh. You recently discussed the opportunity for online advertising to exceed 50% of total advertising in the next five years and you referenced video and Internet connected devices’ as catalyst, it’s a big number. So I was just wondering if you could talk about that in a little more depth and the way Google products actually service catalyst for that change?
And then secondly for Larry, could you just discuss the transition in Android management and what exactly Andy Rubin is going to be doing now that he has a new role? Thank you.
Larry Page
Okay, Nikesh, you want to take the first one?
Nikesh Arora
Sure. Scott, thanks for your question. I think what I was referring to was the fact that I believe in the next few years, we will see connected TVs everywhere and we’ll be able to address a TV using IP. When that begins to happen, I think the products we have in place, where we can dynamically serve ads, which are more personalized, which look more like information on display platforms or video platforms is going to be very relevant.
So I think over time the television industry shifts to a more addressable, more personalized, more IP addressable type of platform and I think we’re well positioned in that space given our large focus and emphasis on brand, given our huge technology efforts that Susan’s team does in our display and video and really getting our sales force working really well with various brand advertisers around the world. So, we are preparing for that eventuality and we hope it comes sooner than later.
Larry Page
And on the management change question, I think, as we’ve already said, we’ve really exceeded crazy ambitious goals we dreamed of for Android. It’s the most used mobile operating system in the world and a very big thanks to Andy for that. He really decided it was time to hand over the reigns and start a new chapter at Google. And we actually have an outside – we haven’t said what that is and I’m not going to make news today on that. And actually going forward, Sundar is going to lead Android in addition to his existing work on Chrome and apps. He has a great talent for creating products that are really technically excellent yet easy to use and he loves a big bet too. So, we said how that performed I think we had very smooth transition and of course excited about the future.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Ross Sandler – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Guys, I had a couple of questions about Google Glass. Larry, we had a chance to try out Glass a few weeks ago and we think you guys really nailed it, so congrats to the team. But can you talk about the overall strategy with Glass? How do you plan to build up the ecosystem for the third-party developers? What do you see as the biggest functions that Glass could address for users? And then do you expect the $1,500 price tag to come down to a level that’s more mainstream or is this likely to remain a higher-end luxury device. Thanks?
Larry Page
Yeah. Thanks, Ross. I’m glad you’re excited about Glass. I am too. Now let’s say it is early days on the profit for just, handing over small numbers so far. I think that we’re probably pretty good at third-party ecosystems, our experience on Android and the bunch of other areas. So I’m not too worried about that. There’s been a lot of speculation on that. I would just say it’s early. And I think the price tag was set for developers for an early test.
We don’t have any news to announce there, but it was clearly – I’m not sure I’ll call it a luxury price, but certainly a pretty high price. I think that what I’m, like doing with my Glass, I think – what do people do in Glass? I really – I find that photo taking and the video, phone calling, quick messaging, directions, all to be a pretty amazing experience and that’s some of the core functionality we built into the device, we’re excited to really get it out to some developers and have other people create some amazing experiences with it, which we haven’t thought of yet. I guess that it’s still early days. But I think it’s very exciting. Our next question, please.

Thanks. You mentioned expansion in the PLA ad format during the call. Would you give us a sense for how maybe CPCs on these PLAs compares to the overall average and what kind of trends you're seeing? And perhaps any comments on the current mix of CPC versus cost per action or convergence and any kind of incremental data on how they perform? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora
Hi, this is Nikesh. So I guess on DLA so far we're very excited, we have a whole billion items in the product listing ads and we just launched it in Europe. It's too early for us to share numbers around that topic, but so far all I would like to say is, it's been neutral. There has been no impact that we’d like to share at the current moment.

Douglas Anmuth – JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, thanks for taking the questions. Just want to ask two things. Nikesh, you talked about Southern Europe being stable in terms of macro. Just curious, since over the last three months if you have seen any changes at all in macro across the U.S. or Europe? And then secondly, Patrick, if you could just talk about how you think about the longer-term margins on the Google segment, that would be helpful. Thanks.
Larry Page
I think Nikesh seems to spend a lot of time in Europe due to the nice weather there.
Nikesh Arora
Nice weather just be more recently, Larry, Q1 was pretty dismal, but – from a weather perspective. Douglas, thanks for the question. I think, as I said, Southern Europe has been stable, because there has been concern at the macro level in Southern Europe, but our business has been stable. I think the macro conditions have been going on for a while. As far as the U.S. and Europe, I don't think there was anything out of the ordinary that we saw as it relate to our business results, and our teams continue to execute and we continue to engage with advertisers across the board, large and small, and we haven't seen any shift in those trends.
Larry Page
Let me jump on the second part of the question. Look I – it’s very clear, we care about revenue growth, we care about profitability, and as we’ve said before, right, we’re not in the business of money losing businesses. So regarding margin, for us what really matters is every incremental profit dollar creates shareholder value and we’re focused on growing these profit dollars rather than the specific of the average aggregate margin.
So if you have business for us, that can be a $20 billion business that has a much lower margin than ours, but kind of contribute a couple of billion for the bottom line of the company, what’s not to like, right, especially if it’s rather capital light. And these are the areas that we’re, in addition to our core business, right, exploring and by the way, they have a great symbiotic relationship, right.
When you have devices that are kind of magical and that kind of feed within our core software businesses, there’s this kind of magical relationship as well that kind of continues to enhance our offering. So the real trick there is to keep focused on dollar margin pools, dollar margin in revenue and then not worry too much about where the aggregate shows up because it’s all good for the shareholders.
Nikesh Arora
We shall say, of course, we always look for businesses that are very high margin and high revenues of course too. We’ll take our next question?

Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hi, great. I just had a couple of questions. One, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you guys can do to help prevent Android fragmentation if you could kind of give us your views there. And then on Fiber, I had a follow-up, if maybe you could go beyond the obvious, which is the obvious benefits that people are getting in cities that you’ve rolled out to. If you could maybe help us think about the types of services or offering that you guys see as being possible as this becomes more broadly deployed.
And then lastly, especially given your prior comments on capital light, I was just wondering how we should think about your appetite for CapEx for Fiber. Thank you.
Larry Page
Yeah, thanks, Heather. I guess I can talk a little bit about the Android in the area. And I think that I’ve actually had the pleasure recently of using a bunch of different Android phones from different manufacturers. The experiences are a bit different. The return, the menu back button is on different sides or things like that. There’s differences like that, just somewhat fragmented. But beyond that, we had a pretty great overall experience and there’s a lot of innovation and that the platform is moving really quickly and that’s how we designed it.
So I think that’s – then the negatives on such fragmentation and the positives on such innovation and flexibility for the different users of the Android ecosystem. So I think actually it’s working pretty well. And we obviously evolve the ecosystem and make sure – making sure that user got a really great experience and making sure, paying attention to the lab and making sure that works well. But I think we’re actually doing a pretty good job. I think on Fiber, you had some questions on Fiber, I think Patrick can address that.
Patrick Pichette
Yeah, I think that the thesis is not only about the future but it’s really a lot about today. Speed matters today, right? When you wait for three seconds to get to a YouTube video today with your current provider, right? That is a terrible answer. And we think that Fiber and the services we offer in Kansas City today actually can go – goes a long way to solving a lot of today’s frustrations independent of tomorrows.
In addition to that, our Kansas City offer that we have, right, is already quite differentiated in offering kind of an amazing service, for example, with storage with 2 terabytes of storage available and another in the cloud that really kind of not only is about speed, but it’s about a package that says, you should have abundance. And with abundance, then the third piece which is kind of I think where you were going is the excitement of what the developer community can actually create for a world that is in fact, at blazing speed and with an abundant of storage.
So I think it’s already today answering a big need, it’s already today quite differentiated and it is just laying the path for what should be the next change of the Internet. And I think that you see it in Kansas City with so many developers moving to Kansas City to actually kind of create this coming world, just gives you a glimpse of all the opportunities that are out there. And that’s why we are very excited about it. I think it’s a….
Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs & Co.
And that’s great, thank you. And I was just wondering if you could help us think about the appetite for CapEx?
Larry Page
All right. I mean, we’re going to look at these businesses as we look at any business and make appropriate investments. I think that obviously we know what’s going on with our business and excited, it’s early days, we’re excited about it. And we will continue to evolve that. But as I said earlier too, I mean, it’s difficult if you – even if you want to spend a lot of money on these kinds of things I think it is quite difficult to do that. So I think that’s also good to keep in mind, some things have a natural rate of growth, but makes sense we’ve done pretty well with that over time.
Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora
Let’s go to our next question, Sean, please. We probably have time for one or two.
Operator
Okay. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
Stephen Ju – Credit Suisse Securities LLC
Thanks very much. So Larry, can you give us some sense of how much incremental engagement you think you can see for Google’s products with new form factors like Glass, and I guess, Watch, as we look out over the next three to five years? And how transportable is Android across these form factors and in terms of getting OEMs and other operators beyond just the smartphones and tablets to adopt that. And, Nikesh, thanks for a number of campaigns on the enhanced campaigns platform. Now wondering like what percent of your advertisers do you think have optimized their sites for content delivery across multiple devices? And when do you think we’ll get greater ability for attribution across mobile and desktop? Thank you.
Larry Page
I think, Steve, there is a lot of questions, I think we got (most of them) [ph], let’s see. So incremental engagement from Google’s products from Glass and so on and watches and things, I think that computers are now pretty big part of people’s lives and I think that’s increasing as it gets more and more useful. And so the amount of time, you only have 24 hours in a day, so there is some limit to that. But I think more importantly, the usefulness of your engagement is going to increase. So right now, while you are just kind of using your computer or your phone or your tablet or whatever and you are kind of bored, maybe you will be less bored and more productive or enjoy what you are doing more and seeing more meaningful engagements. And I think that can result in much better business results and happier people and all that.
I think obviously Glass runs on Android, so it’s been pretty transportable across devices, and I think that will continue. I think, Nikesh, do you want to address the enhanced campaigns a little bit?
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, so thank you Steven for your question. I think what’s important to note is before we launched our enhanced campaigns journey in February, we have been very actively working for the last year plus on our grow more campaign, which is grow more, because clearly, the first part of anybody leveraging the mobile websites just to have one. So we spent a lot of time working with our advertisers and partners out there both to get them online and also to get them mobile. And I think the enhanced campaigns with them was a logical step beyond that. Once you have mobile capability, once you have mobile sites and desktops, we want to make sure that you can get best ROI across those things. I think we’re still working on this; we’re still down the journey. we have a significant number of our early adopters on to enhanced campaigns and as I said, we intend to get them all migrated in the next few months, another next 10 weeks actually. So should be pretty good.
in terms of future, I think we also alluded to the fact that some of the things we’re offering them are things like proximity bidding and offers. so it’s more about first getting them to leverage, their current capabilities, but then also giving more context and more location, which hopefully generates more ROI in the future.
Steve Ju – Credit Suisse Securities LLC
Thank you.
Nikesh Arora
We have time for one last question. Sean, who’s getting our last question?
Operator
Our final question comes from Neil Doshi with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
Neil Doshi – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
Great, thanks for squeezing me in. Larry, could you talk a little bit about online/mobile to offline attribution and what Google is doing to help kind of bridge that gap and to help our advertisers realize ROI? And then, Nikesh, can you just give us an update as to how far you are through the apps changes policy with your network partners? Is that pretty much all done now or is there more to go there? Thanks.
Larry Page
Thanks, Neil, for your question. I think maybe Nikesh, who is the expert on both these. I think our business has always been about attributing advertising spending and results accurately. And the whole success of our company is really based on that one thing. So we are paying a lot of attention to those kind of questions. So, Nikesh, take it away.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, Neil, thanks for the question, and thank you, Larry. I guess, what’s the important part is, we have been working, we have hundreds of studies now working with our advertisers to actually look at both the offline and online impacts? And one of the recent things we did is, online to store as we have helped people understand how their online campaigns are driving more and more people into store, which is most of an online activity. We also look at the entire customer journey. We look at across media effectiveness to show how you can run a campaign in the off-line world, how you can add online to it and what kind of attribution that gets you in all off-line media as well as online media.
So we do a bunch of stuff like that. So our research teams are working with external research organizations. So I think we have a reasonably robust practice there working with our advertisers. And in terms of the update, in terms of the ads policy changes, we have implemented all of our ads policies. We obviously have worked with almost all of our network partners. They understand our policies. Many of them have made changes. I think we should be done with most of the transition, but of course, the effect of this policy change will continue to happen throughout the rest of the year.
Larry Page
Okay. Well, thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Yeah. You there?
Larry Page
I'm sorry; I didn’t hear myself, sorry. I was going to ask – thank everyone for spending so much time with us today and we look forward to hearing from you in the next quarter.

Good day and welcome everyone to the Google Inc. fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Willa Chalmers, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Willa Chalmers

With that, I will turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Page
Happy New Year everyone and welcome to our earnings call. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. We ended 2012 with a strong quarter. Revenue was up 36% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter and we hit $50 billion in revenue for the first time last year, not a bad achievement in just a decade-and-a-half.
We have talked a lot about excellence and velocity over the last year. While many claim it's my nature never to be satisfied, we've actually made real progress creating more beautiful and more intuitive products.
Take Search. The perfect search engine would understand exactly what you mean and give you exactly what you want. Our Knowledge Graph brings that much closer.
Search for Nikola Tesla and you will get information about this great inventor that is beautifully displayed right from the results page. His basic bio, books he wrote, his photo, no extra work needed, and we even recommend information about other inventors such as Edison and Marconi that you can easily browse through. Again, right from the results page.
And last quarter, we launched the Knowledge Graph in seven new languages, including Spanish, Japanese and Russian. This is hard work. It's about way more than translating the words on the page. Google has to understand millions of different entities as well as their meaning and context.
I'm also excited about the progress we’ve made with Voice Search.  You're in your car, sadly it's still a car you have to drive and it’s not electric and you're running out of gas. Just pick up your phone and ask Google for directions to the nearest gas station and you'll be on your way immediately. It's a great example of how we can take the hassle right out of your life.
Our long-term investments in Google Maps have really paid off. The team has worked tremendously hard to create the most accurate and comprehensive maps in the world. Driving country-by-country may have seemed crazy a few years back. Today, it’s totally obvious, because location is core to your search experience. And with Google Maps for iOS, we have reinvigorated our product. It's more intuitive and beautiful, and users love it. Google Maps for iOS was downloaded over 10 million times in the first 48 hours.
In fact, six Google apps were included in Apple's App Store Best Free Apps of 2012, including YouTube, Chrome, Google Search and Gmail.
I’ve always believed that computers should do the hard work, so you can get on with the things that matter in life living, learning and loving. So it’s exciting to see our progress with Google Now. Launched earlier in the year, it gives you information before you even have to ask. We’ll now proactively provide your flight times, or your boarding pass, or directions to your next appointment. We'll even suggest interesting places to visit nearby.
As we discussed on the last earnings call, we now live in a multi-screen world. People carry a supercomputer in their pocket all the time. In fact, we feel naked without our smartphone and many users have more than one device, a laptop, a phone, and a tablet. We are living in unchartered territory. It's a new kind of computing environment. Everyone is really excited about the technology and are spending a lot of money on devices driving faster adoption than we have ever seen before.
It's been a long time in computing since we had this rate of change. It probably hasn’t happened since the birth of personal computing. It's why we have put so much focus on devices. They have been one of our biggest bets in the last few years, along with software to go with these devices, Chrome and Android.
Our goal here is to push the user experience forward, so you get the best of Google in one easy to use package. The Samsung Chromebook, which we launched in October at an amazing price of $249 was a holiday highlight. I love mine. It is super easy to use and almost maintains itself. Open a chrome tab on your phone and everything syncs on your laptop with no extra effort required. We also launched two new Nexus devices to rave reviews, Nexus 4 and Nexus 10.
In six months after we first unveiled it, the Nexus 7 continues to define the 7 inch tablet category making many best of 2012 and holiday gift lists. Clearly there is work to be done in managing our supply better, as well as building a great customer experience and that is a priority for the teams. But considering all the excitement over the holidays for our devices, it is clear there is tremendous opportunity in delivering great value with amazing and simple user experience.
Google Play, another big bet is on fire. The growth is tremendous. This quarter we signed deals with Time as well as Warner Music Group. So we now provide contents from all the top Hollywood film studios, music labels and magazine publishers. We have not even reached Google Play's first anniversary.
Many of you have questions about Motorola, and Patrick will go into details of our accounting for the business so that you can do your models right. I am excited about the business. In today's multi-screen world the opportunities are endless. Think about your devices, battery life is a huge issue. You shouldn’t have to worry about constantly recharging your phone. When you drop your phone, it shouldn’t go splat. Everything should be ton faster and easier.
There is real potential to invent new and better experiences. Our CEO of Motorola, Dennis, has built a world-class team and they are working on the opportunities. It is still early days but I am excited about the innovative ways they are approaching product development and speed of their execution and they recently signed and agreement to sell more Motorola's home division for $2.35 billion.
2012 was an amazing year for Google and we are all set for a great 2013. I am incredibly optimistic about the opportunities we have as a technology company focused on user benefits. Every day I come to work excited about more and bigger opportunities and every day we work to have more and better organized Googlers, those are employees, improving the execution and overall capabilities to deliver world the world changing products. I know it sounds funny but with the ambitious plans we have, we are only just getting started.
Our biggest challenge in this area is focus. We face so many opportunities and so it is important to thoughtfully invest in the right areas where we can have the greatest impact. We don't want to describe ourselves too thin, but I am quite optimistic that as we get better and better in managing our product areas, we will be able to continue to grow our ambitions. That's why I am here and that's one reason why Google Earth, now working at Google. Google Earth remains our greatest asset and we are working hard to recruit and retain the best employees. We've had a great start to the year, by being in the Fortune Magazine's, the best company to work for in the U.S. for the fourth time.
We worked hard to create a company, where everyone is part of the family and where the work is challenging and rewarding, so I'm really happy to get that recognition. I want to finish by thanking all the Googlers who made this possible, and now I'll turn it over to Patrick. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. So, let's dive in by reviewing the detail of our overall business financial performance. As we noted in a blog post last week, the Motorola Home business has been presented separately as discontinued operations in our financial tables. This makes typical quarter-on-quarter or year-on-year comparisons a little more challenging this quarter, but I will provide some color throughout my comments. So without further ado, here we go.
Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 36% year-over-year to $14.4 billion, and 8% quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned, this figure excludes the Motorola Home revenue. Had we included Motorola Home, gross total consolidated revenue would have been $15.2 billion, a growth rate of 44% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter.
Google standalone gross revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $12.9 billion and 12% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google Website revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $8.6 billion and up 12% quarter-over-quarter with strengths across most geographies and industries. Our Google Network revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $3.4 billion and 10% quarter-over-quarter, finally, other revenue grew 102% year-over-year to $829 million and 24% quarter-over-quarter driven by Play hardware and content sales. And were it not for fluctuations in currencies Google standalone revenue would have in fact grown 24% year-over-year.
Turning to Motorola Mobility, its gross revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter. And once again had we included the Home business, the total gross revenue for the combined Motorola entities would have been $2.3 billion. As Larry mentioned, we are really pleased with the velocity of change at Motorola, but it's still at a very beginning of the Motorola Google story. No one should be surprised if results from this segment are a variable for quite a while as we restructure the business. And remember, we inherited a 12 to 18 months product pipeline that we are still working through.
At Google Now, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong, up 24% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter. As we said many times, there are several factors that impact the CPC click dynamics, including FX, geo mix, product changes et cetera, but this quarter specifically it's worth mentioning that we implemented some policy changes that lowered our paid click growth, improved our CPC growth and lowered network revenue for the quarter. Nikesh will speak more about this in a few minutes, but the bottom line is, that these policies are part of many constant changes that are focused on what's good for the user and advertisers, so we believe they are good for Google's business in the long-term too.
Our aggregate cost per click was down 6% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Once again remember that currency headwinds also had a moderate year-on-year negative impact on CPC in Q4. In fixed FX terms, in fact aggregate CPC would have been down only 4% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to geographic performance of Google's standalone business we continue to see strong performance in the U.S. and the U.K. while the economic situation of Southern Europe continues to impact our rest of world growth somewhat. In our earning slides, which you can find on our investor relations website, you will see that we have broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
Revenue from the U.S. was up 20% year-over-year to $6 billion. The U.K. was up 23% year-over-year to $1.3 billion which includes [an immaterial] [ph] benefit from our hedging program. In fact in fixed FX terms the U.K. grew 22%. Non-U.S. Revenue, excluding the U.K., accounted for 44% of our total revenue or $5.6 billion, up 24% year-over-year and includes a $36 million benefit from our hedging program and in fixed FX terms rest of world grew 28%.
So now if I come back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, our other cost of revenue was $3 billion in Q4, excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring, our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.1 billion, which also exclude SBC and Motorola restructuring and our non-GAAP operating profit was $4.3 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 30%. For standalone Google, traffic acquisition costs were $3.1 billion or 25% of total advertising revenue.
Our other cost of revenue was $1.8 billion excluding $101 million of stock-based compensation. The increase year-over-year was driven by equipment costs, including the cost associated with hardware sales on Play but also content acquisition costs and our data center costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.6 billion excluding stock-based compensation of $576 million. Finally, non-GAAP operating profit was $4.4 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 34%.
One last note. Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment for standalone Google was $493 million for this quarter. At Motorola Mobility, total non-GAAP operating expenses including cost of revenue were $1.7 billion and keep in mind that intangible amortization expense attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola mobility, they are included in these non-GAAP measures.
Of the $289 million in intangible amortization expense this quarter, $153 million was a result of the acquisition of Motorola and of which $116 million is allocated to Google and $37 million allocated to Motorola Mobility. As a result, the non-GAAP operating loss on Motorola Mobility was $152 million in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of negative 10% for that segment.
Let me turn to headcount. Headcount for the consolidated headcount increased by roughly 300 people in Q4. Keep in mind that consolidated headcount includes Motorola Home until it is divested and Home comprises roughly one third of the total Motorola headcount. Standalone Google added about 1,400 people and in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter at around 53,900 full-time employees.
Our effective tax rate this quarter was 18%. The change from last quarter reflects the mix in shifts of earnings between domestic and international subsidiary and hedges.
Now let me turn quickly to cash management. Other income and expense was 152 million for quarter, which reflects realized gains on investments and interest income offset by the continued impact of FAS 133 expense from our hedging program. For more details on OI&E, please again refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
Our operating cash flow was very strong, $4.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $1 billion versus last quarter of $872 million. The majority of CapEx expense was related to production equipment, data center construction and facilities related purchases. We are very pleased with our free cash flow which was $3.7 billion and please note that cash flow and CapEx both include the Home business for now.
So finally the success of our products and our continued strong performance, as portrayed by Larry's comments continues to give us the confidence to fund our strategic growth in areas such as search, YouTube, Android, Chrome as well as in our overall infrastructure with a view to the long-term. I will hand off now to Nikesh who will cover in more detail of our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks, we will open it up for the phone lines for any questions. Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. As Larry and Patrick have mentioned, our business had a strong quarter with $12.9 billion revenue in Google standalone alone. We are very pleased with our year-on-year growth of 22%. I think our advertising business is firing on all cylinders. Companies of all sizes continue to embrace online advertising and our major players increasing their investments. In fact, here's an interesting tidbit. Across search display, YouTube and more, our top 25 advertisers are now spending average of over $150 million per year. Did I deliver that number?
Our core business continues to be strong. Our investments in mobile shopping, our past holiday test with Flying Colors. As Larry mentioned, our vision is for search to understand exactly what you mean and give you exactly what you want in all devices that you live with throughout your day.
Talking about the devices, our queries from wide ranging of new devices are continuing to power our overall growth in search volumes. Distinctions between devices, form factors are becoming less meaningful, particularly between desktop, laptops and tablets.
Our Search performed very well last quarter during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We still have greater proportion of queries with commercial intent and higher RPMs in areas like retail, computers and electronics. We launched a set of features to make shopping stress free and more fun. I don't know if you've had a chance to look at it, but there are some interesting things like 360 degree toy imagery and integrating retailers' promotions and discounts into our shopping product.
Our investments in Search, particularly in mobile and shopping are really helping clients. Now, let me give you an example. Front End Audio. This is the company that offers recording and light sound equipment sales. Sometime in mid-September, the deployed product lifting ads, within weeks these ads were accounting for about 15% of the total sales. They also tripled their click through rates and also reduced their cost per conversion by 75% to 80%. This is great for us, because the product we believe is in the interest of the end users. It's a great product for Front End Audio improves their economics and improves our economy.
Major retailers like RadioShack and Home Depot, they use our Mobile Apps 3 shoppers across devices, including click-to-call, click-to-map. For Home Depot, mobile commerce sales are quadrupled in a year. Patrick mentioned some changes in policy and enforcement. These enforcements had the effect of reducing ad clicks on the sites of certain AdSense for search partners. These policy updates are part of our ongoing work to improve user experiences on Google and on site in terms of using Google Search. Since these policies improve the experience of both users and advertisers, we firmly believe they are good for our business in the long-term.
Switching gears to YouTube in display, we are continuing to make strong progress here, but there was a key language that brand speak, so it continues to be a key area of focus for us. Videos are baked into the core of all of our products whether it's search, display, mobile, and of course YouTube itself.
YouTube is well positioned for the changing viewing habits of today's multi-screen world. The site's new redesign is focused on channels and that has led to major increase in engagement. In 2012, viewers watched over 4 billion hours of video on YouTube a month and it's now available across over 400 million mobile devices, gaming consoles and connector PDs in addition to your desktop.
YouTube creators continue to vow and attract audiences. Outside estimate say that video on which I am sure all of you have seen of PSY, his hit song, Gangnam Style, now the most watched YouTube video for all times, it generated over $8 million in all-in advertising deal. YouTube Partner revenue has doubled for the fourth consecutive year and thousands of channels are now making six figures annually.
YouTube is not only home for creators, but it's also home for major brand advisers. On YouTube, our top 100 global advertisers spent over 50% more in 2012 than they did in 2011. Clearly this is a strong signal of the power in YouTube to reach audiences. What's interesting is the significant factor into growth of YouTube has been our TrueView skippable ad format. Agencies and marketers are seeing real benefits. You only pay for the ad if viewers watch them. In fact, 70% of our in-stream ads are now TrueView formats and this quarter TrueView came to Xbox, the iPad, and the Wii.
Putting all our advertiser solutions together, it is really helping us deliver greater returns and develop close relationships with major clients worldwide. Like McDonald's, who this quarter launched always on search in YouTube campaign to increase customer awareness and their ability towards their brands across all channels.
In Q4, we signed a new global deal with L'Oreal, under which we worked to promote their brands using Google's digital offerings across the world in Display, Search, YouTube and more. While our complete solution for marketers not only applies to businesses, but we saw this in this quarter's 2012 election from the presidency to local races.
Google's mobile search, video and measurement products were the center of a huge number of Democratic, Republican initiatives and campaigns. Our election advertising revenues increased by five times over the 2008 election. Here is an interesting statistic for you. In nine of the top 11 Senate races for the U.S., the candidates who spent more with Google, was elected.
Well, 2012 was not just a big year for advertising, it was a big year for publisher business as well. Working closely with major publishers, from weather channel to timing, bringing the DoubleClick Google ad technology stack together is really helping our clients increase their direct, indirect and programmatic CPMs. Our solutions for media companies now (inaudible) be on advertising encompassing paid service, subscriptions and more.
That was about our business, our ad revenue. Other highlights looking at the geographic breakdown of our ads business. Growth in Northern Europe was robust, with strength in Germany and the U.K. Asia performed steadily and other regions were very pleased that Americas maintain steady growth driven by strength in mobile and YouTube. Southern Europe was somewhat softer as it continues to face macroeconomic challenges.
Our enterprise business continues to grow at an impressive pace. It's been gaining traction across some of the largest companies in the world. New customers this quarter include Nintendo, the Canadian Broadcasting Company, Shaw industries, Costco, Randstad and Hyundai to name a few. Also signing in May is the U.S. Department of Interior, moved more than 70,000 employees to the cloud during Q4 making it the largest federal agency to date using Google Apps.
I think I solid, we have had a good quarter. Our revenues continue to grow. Clients continue to see value with us and value in online advertising. We have been able to build significant new revenue streams at mobile, YouTube and display and clearly arising one in enterprise. We have weathered various economic storms and are benefiting from the shift in advertising spend towards digital media plus there is continued strong execution and client relationships.
I want to echo Larry's congratulations to our teams around the world for all their hard work in delivering a great quarter and stellar year in a tough environment. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. With that, I am going to turn it over to Jennifer who will open the lines for the Q&A. Jennifer, all yours.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein
Two questions. Last quarter we saw a material sequential decline of Google websites' revenues growth rate of more than 400 basis points. Even after accounting for FX, this quarter we see another deceleration I think about 250 basis points on an FX neutral basis in the Google websites' revenue line. Of these, in the context where YouTube is growing really fast based on your comments, so what have been the major drivers of this continued deceleration of Google websites? Should we expect similar growth rate declines going forward? 
Secondly on TAC, it seems TAC for distribution as a percentage of Google websites' revenues grew less than what we had seen earlier in the last several quarters in 2012. What has driven the stabilization of this TAC, distribution TAC and how should we think about distribution TAC in the future? Thank you.
Larry Page
Well, thank you, Carlos for the detailed question. I am going to turn that over to Patrick for, hopefully, a good answer.
Patrick Pichette
Yes, thank you. So Carlos, on the first one, you are right that there is quite a bit of noise because of FX on the sites year-over-year between Q3 and Q4 but overall I think that we are very pleased with the growth around 20%. You are right that in the last quarter there was a bit more headwinds than this quarter but overall the core search business is doing well and driven really by the strength in mobile and we are obviously additionally pleased with the YouTube business, particularly the watch page. So, despite the fact that there is quite a bit of FX noise in there and that FX does carry over to sites, overall I think that we are very pleased with the overall growth.
In terms of TAC I think that that’s the case where obviously our mobile revenue is growing and it is having impact on our mix shift. That’s really the fundamental trend that you see in TAC rather than change in the TAC rate of any particular partner. So that’s really what's going on there but I think as we said in the previous calls we think of TAC in the way, there is a really positive story in TAC, which is, it is distribution and it is worth paying for.
This is the positive side of our business having much more distribution of our apps across and that’s true also for mobile. So we are really thrilled that all of the mobile is thriving to the extent that it is and remember that, finally, TAC is not a new phenomenon for us. We have always dealt with distribution partners and we'll continue to experience and manage it to make sure that it drives revenue and profit for both parties in a balanced way, so nothing new here but really excited by the trends.
Thank you Carlos. We will go to our next question, please.
Operator
We will take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
Two questions for Larry around the notion of Answers not linked. First on Knowledge Graph, can you just give us a high level view on where we are in terms of its implementation and how widely it's rolled out? And specifically, how if at all it impacts the economics of Google's businesses? 
And then second Google Shopping, the PLAs and the interface changes, I think significantly improve the user experience, but the consumer still needs to leave the site to transact. Do you anticipate a mechanism whereas users can actually transact on Google Shopping without having to leave? You know, as you said sort of no extra work needed? Thanks.
Larry Page
Well, Ben, thank you for the questions. I think we rolled out Knowledge Graph very recently and I think we are still in the early stages of that. I think that, I mentioned some of the internationalization work that we did which is hard work and I think we'll continue to do that. I mean it's still 1% or something where we should be, so I am really excited about what we can do in the future. I think the economics points, I think that the way we look at it is we provide much better answers for people really grow the business. We increased the number times that you might want information, because you know you are going to get correct answers or increasing it for modalities, you can get answers like Voice, or Mobile or so on, so I am somewhat excited about that and generally we monetize those things. So, I don’t have a comment on specifics of that, but it think we are quite excited about that.
The Knowledge Graph does run on the right hand side where the ads also run. [I expect] [ph] there could be some short-term impacts on that, but I think the primary thing is getting people better answers is really good for our business. 
Google Shopping, I guess you are asking about product listing ads I think that we are also in the early stages of that. We just rolled out Google Shopping. We’ve seen tremendous uptake from merchants and from users and I expect that quality of the site, the ease of  buying things will improve over time and I am really excited about that. I am not going to comment on details about that, but we’re always focused on making our user experience better. So, can we have our next question please?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Thanks. I guess, following up on Ben's comment regarding Answers versus Links. Larry, you recently quoted I think saying about the possibility of having a system that could basically vacation plan for you. And now that you own ITA and Frommer’s and Zagat and you've built out travel explorer or flight explorer and Hotel Finder. Can you talk a bit more about the strategy with travel in terms of the problem you are trying to solve there relative to this historic experience of Google sending you offsite for depth of experience. And then secondly, Patrick, I think last quarter you gave the FX neutral CPC down 8%. I wonder if you could give that same number for this quarter, thanks. For the fourth quarter?
Larry Page
Yes, Scott. That's a great question. I'll take the first part, and I think that we've always done a very good job of sending people to the right places and I don't think that being able to answer very complex information means necessarily that we wouldn't send people off to other sites, So I think the main thing for us is to be able to understand the complex problem. Like, I think, I gave some example like finding a hotel that's near (inaudible) logistics for the flight, for a vacation you might take and the hotel and the activities we wanted to do, kind of solving that all at once in a way a human assistant might be able to do.
And, you still might use other parties to do that transaction, so I don’t necessarily believe the assumption of your question, but we are looking at those things. It was more of an example. I think Google’s aspiration is to be able to that for any area. Not just travel and we have been working with as many companies as we can and trying to organize the web’s information. And where we needed to acquire companies, we have done some of that or work with other companies or make deals or whatever we need to do. So we are trying to be practical about it and I think we do have some amazing assets in travel and mapping and so on. I think those things will pay off for us in the future providing great experience. So, Patrick?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, Scott, the answer to your specific question is, the CPCs have, on a year-over-year basis, they have gone down 4% and on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they are 1%. That is on a fixed FX adjusted and so that compares to the minus six and plus two that I mentioned a couple of minutes ago. Thanks for your questions, Scott. Jennifer, let's go to our next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Great, thanks. Two questions. Could you talk broadly where you are on cash about Google Maps and where do you think the monetization of that is today versus where you think it potentially could be? Then, Larry, I think you were quoted recently with some comments on competitive products out in the market. Any comments, in particular, on graphical search as it has been announced and to what extent you think that’s complementary or competitive with Google's core search? Thank you very much.
Larry Page
Well, I can say a little bit about Maps. So this is Larry. I think that people are always focused on monetization of Maps but it's important to think about, for me, it’s the history of Maps. We started working on Maps a long, long time ago and because we thought it was critical to your search experience.
It is actually finding what you are looking for and if we look at our component of queries that are geographically related, it’s a huge number and always has been. So again, to understand those queries we have to understand where things are in the real world. So that’s been always the core part of our main web search.
We already make quite a bit of money on web search and I already told you that was a significant amount of queries. So we actually we already make quite a bit of money on Maps in that way as a part of our core business, and a significant part, which really allowed us to make those investments.
We are in the early stages of monetization on the Maps themselves. I think we are doing some interesting things there. I think we will continue to do that. I think it is likely to be a great source of revenue but still in the early stages on the Maps, but on the search side, we have significant revenue already.
I think you are asking about graph search, which was recently announced. I think that when leaving about search, our mission has been to organize the world's information and making it universally accessible and useful. We have been at that for quite a while and made investments in all sorts of areas, like Maps, as I just mentioned which turned out to be really important. That’s the way we think about. There is knowledge search, there is all sorts of investments we have made, gathering different kinds of data and making sure we have everyone's data and we will continue to do that. That business has change a lot.
Only 10 years ago, what you though Google should do, is almost unrecognizable compared to what it does now and the number of things that it understands. So we see just tremendous opportunity to make better products for users that really understand their needs and really grow that opportunity and if you look at voice, for example, which we have also made huge investment in, the importance of that to mobile for finding things. I mentioned you can ask Google where the nearest gas station is on your phone while you are driving on your phones and it does all this work perfectly. So I think we see that as just all sorts of aspects on those problem and we have been very focused on that.
Now there is another great example. There is tremendous innovation there. It is actually answering your question before you even think to have the question and that's pretty incredible. I am super excited about that, so I feel very confident of our core business of organizing things, finding things, getting people information. I couldn't be more excited about that. Our next question?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.
Anthony Diclemente - Barclays
Hi. First for Patrick on Motorola in terms of the lawsuit which widened in the quarter, I am wondering if you could contextualize for us the financial direction of Motorola, both, in terms of the revenue declining and the growing expenses. I mean, I know this isn't something that Google typically does, but I think it would be helpful for investors if there's any way to kind of put a band or threshold around what the potential operating losses could be at Motorola.
And then second question for Larry around the commercialization of driverless cars. I just wonder if you could give us an update on that and your test that you're doing in Nevada and I am wondering if you could talk about Android as part of that? It sounds like the automotive, electronics suppliers are recognizing the importance of Android for the infotainment systems in those cars and so maybe you can talk a little bit about that opportunity for Android as well? Thanks for the question.
Larry Page
I think maybe I'll take the second half of your question first. I think that, I would say also on Motorola and then I will let Patrick fill in. I mean we are so excited about them in this. I think that we're really in the early days of Motorola with respect to Google's acquisition of it, and I'll let him give you some details.
I think that on driverless cars, I think obviously it's still early days to answer. Although I'm really excited about what the team has got done and what that can mean for ordinary people and really substantially improving mobility and potentially really reducing the land area that we have to devote for cars which is incredible amounts in cities. It can really reduce parking. We are looking at that. Even for Google just as a major cost to reduce our parking costs in our facilities by having automated cars parked more densely and serve more people.
I think those things will be amazing deals. Android I think that we are still. That's little bit different than the automated cars I think, but Android won't be used in cars probably before we get automated cars into the mainstream. I think people are really excited about that due to the incredible success of Android and we are obviously working with those manufacturers to help them make that happen well. So, Patrick?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, just a bit of color on Motorola. Right? First just to remind everybody, we do care about profitability and that is our goal with every one of the areas where we invest, and we said that before and we are not in the business for losing money with Motorola or even cross subsiding it. But, we are really 180 days into this journey and we've made a ton of progress, including the sale of the Home business. And as I mentioned earlier also we are kind of outsourcing our manufacturing and so much more that has been done and the restructurings that you have heard earlier in the late summer and early fall.
So, and I just want to remind everybody that we inherited kind of 12 to 18 months of product pipeline that we have to work through and that's the reality of the business, that's kind of overhaul and then kind of rebuild the new product pipeline where Dennis's team has kind of been really focused on in addition to the restructuring. It does take time before it shows up.
Having said that finally on the financials themselves, Anthony, it's really worth noting that Motorola is also hindered by a portion of the amortization of intangibles due to the acquisition, so the losses that you see are somewhat inflated by this amortization of intangibles which we've decided to kind of put through the P&L on a non-GAAP basis.
So, all-in-all, when we look at the losses like this quarter, a negative $150 million, you take out the amortization, these are not consequential losses relative to either Google or the kind of turnaround we are seeing and the kind of positive momentum. So, that's why Larry started by saying we are really optimistic, but it does take time and that's why I am also saying, be ready for a lot of fluctuations in our P&L over the coming quarters. It's just the nature of the bees when you reinvent business. Thank you for your question, Anthony. Let's go, Jennifer, to our next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Larry, I think on your last call, you mentioned that you are impatient with mobile CPCs, not that they were not bad place but you wanted to get them higher. Can you talk about progress made in the quarter and do you feel like you are really making a positive inflection there or is that still a few quarters away?
Then as you as you look at your mobile business as far as the growth of queries or the growth of revenues and you look at it relative to maybe mcommerce growth, do you think you are gaining share of the market? Do you feel like your position in mobile is really secure and that you maybe even be gaining share in mobile or maybe the street doesn’t recognize it? Thank you.
Larry Page
Thank you for your question. Let's see, the mobile business, it has been going very well. We have tremendous growth with the Android. We are serving our users really well. We are building amazing products that are getting better at a rapid rate. The rate of improvement are obviously very high. So I feel pretty comfortable that my focus mostly on our products and assume that their usage will follow the great products.
I think that in some sense, some of you may consider mobile an extension over the desktop usage too. I mean, we have built a lot of great products that people use for the desktops like Maps which was transferred very well. And I think that one thing I was amazed by Chrome on my Android phone, Chrome is just an amazing experience. So, using my Nexus phone or other more smartphones from the latest generation, those phones are almost like using a desktop of last year or something like that.
So I think the experiences are improving a lot and very, very quickly. So I think we have hit some uncharted territory, because of the rapid rate of change in these things but I am very, very optimistic about it. I think that CPCs will improve as these devices are improving as well. Obviously, I mentioned that we are working to simplify our ad system for advertisers. In the light of all these changes and I am excited about our plans there.
We don’t have anything to announce today but I am very excited about our efforts there. I think that we will make rapid progress in that area. So I think I answered both of your questions. So maybe we can have our next question.
Operator
We will take our next question from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse
Thanks, guys. So I guess the pace of your headcount increases is used to be moderating as we take a look back 2012 and the same goes for CapEx as well. So do you feel like you are now at an appropriate level to tackle your three major areas of investment focus?
I guess another way to ask the question is, are there any other large scale opportunities you have identified that would entail acceleration in terms of your hiring or CapEx? Thank you.
Larry Page
I think we have run a number of different businesses and I think that they all have different needs and it's sort of like, we are looking at the sum of all those things. So I think it is a little bit hard to predict those things. I think you should ask us to do whatever is necessary to make the most business outcome. Having said that, I think we have some time in the past we have had a lot of people, we are growing at the edge of what's been the modest in terms of scaling. I think that’s still the case. We would say, that’s moderated but I would say that we have also slowed our international growth and products development a bit which is probably having some impact on that. So I guess, I will give it to Patrick for some more detail, perhaps.
Patrick Pichette
Okay, just the comment on the CapEx side. We have always said and I think if you go back the last couple of years on CapEx, it has been really lumpy. We have gone from really highs where we were above $1 billion and then it's come all the way down to a few hundred million dollars.
Now it's kind of moved back up, so it's a real testimony that it is lumpy, because as you add, just to use the example of a data center, as you will see CapEx, because we fill with equipment at data center. But once the data center is full and then we have to put an extension to the data center or then you are into concrete again and power. So, it's just the nature of our business.
Certainly on the core businesses are quite lumpy, so we without giving any guidance forward, we have been as you've seen in this quarter $1 billion of CapEx, really very much aligned with the excitement we have around our products, whether it be social, whether it be pictures, whether it be all of the areas that you have heard Larry talk about and so that's why we are fueled as I said in my comments.
We are fueled by the positive momentum we have in many areas of the company and we believe now is the time to invest and that's why we are doing it with confidence, discipline with confidence.
Larry Page
Ross, I'll also just add briefly that when we run our business, we find that it works better if our hiring is reasonably smooth, so we have worked harder to manage that smoothness. We have recruiters in place and hiring staff in place for the long-term and make sure we'll provide a good consistent business growth there just makes us operationally run better and we've probably been managing that a bit more tightly.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question, Steven. Let's go to our next question, please, Jennifer.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities
Thanks guys. I have got two questions, first for Nikesh on Mobile and then one follow-up for Patrick on the Google sites TAC. So, Nikesh, what percent of your several million advertising clients are bidding on mobile key words today and what percentage do you think have mobile-specific websites enabled already?
And then Patrick, the follow-up on TAC, the year-over-year growth rate for Google website's TAC decelerated from 45% to 43%, subtle but there is probably some organic items in there that are helping it. Is that a function of smartphone installation growth rolling over or any partnership agreements or something else? Can you just give us a little color on that deceleration? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora
Thanks for your question, Ross. On the mobile front, I think it's important to understand that a vast majority of our advertisers have opted into mobile from an advertising point of view. I think Larry said this a few quarters ago that we slowly have been working over time to try and make it feel like a common experience across multiple screens for advertisers, because advertisers are more interested in the business benefit of advertising with us as opposed to specifically which form factor, which device they invest with us on, so our teams have been working really hard in the last few quarters to try and get us to a point where we can make it simple for the advertiser where they come to us with a business problem and we are able to solve it for them irrespective of device, irrespective of form factor or property that they are going to have advertise on. So, from that perspective, I think things are going in the right direction.
As far as specifically how many advertisers have mobile landing pages that they can send their users to? That number is not as much as we would like it. Obviously, we've had programs, we have talked about in the past earning calls like GoMo which help businesses go mobile, so those efforts are bearing fruit but broadly speaking, I think we are happy with the progress we have made both on getting advertisers to be more mobilized and also what we are doing from a campaign management perspective to get more and more campaigns that can run across all devices and form factors.
Larry Page
I'll just add on the mobile question. We don’t necessarily want them to have mobile sites some are too simple and I find I get kind of frustrated on my phone sometimes when I have these mobile specific sites because I am using a modern Nexus 4 that can actually view up the full site and I just find it confusing.
So, I think as an industry, we need to improve these experiences and that will take a bit of time, but I'd almost say that we should be designing for mobile the kind of mobile phones that we had now the state-of-the-art or a little bit beyond and that those experiences should work on all devices pretty well, so I'd actually like to us go more in that direction perhaps, so Patrick?
Patrick Pichette
Just on my side, I need Ross, I need you to actually call us after this. Because, when I look at our TAC for the Google Web as a percentage of website revenue, it is pretty stable to us and every way we look at it is pretty stable. So I am not sure if there is anything you are looking into it that we are missing but don't hesitate to follow-up with the IR team afterwards. But we don’t see any deceleration in any meaningful way on the website side. Thanks, Ross.
Larry Page
Great, can we have our next question?
Operator
Yes, we will take our next question from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.
Richard Kramer - Arete Research
Thanks very much. Larry, a couple of quick questions. First of all, just to polish up this Mobile and CPC question, how many years do you think it's going to take before CPCs on Mobile and Desktop are roughly equal trading off location and display size?
Another question, looking broadly at the business, there are a number of geographical markets like China where you are simply not able to operate. Do you see any prospect for being able to enter some of those markets in the medium term? Or do you think that the business is still going to be geographically constrained?
Then a quick one for Patrick, will there be an impairment test coming up on Motorola especially with respect to the IPR given the FTC settlement around Standards-Essential Patent? Thanks.
Larry Page
Thanks, Richard, for all the questions. I think that's a threefer. The problem seems to be, and I am not going to make predictions about when they will be equal; I don't think they will be equal, I think probably one will always be bigger than the other, though, not clear which way but I don't think this is a long-term problem. I don't think this is a long time in coming, and I think as I have said before, there's a lot of advantages to mobile.
You already know location quite clearly, you can call somebody easily, you have a camera, you can hangout with the business, you can be notified instantly. There's just a lot of things about mobile that are amazing opportunities for advertisers and for businesses. So I expect that to revolutionize how people do marketing and we are working hard on that. I expect that that will work a lot better for users and for advertisers and businesses, and therefore more money. We will be able to generate a lot more money than we do now.
Okay, so maybe Nikesh can address China.
Nikesh Arora
I thought I was getting the mobile CPC question, Larry.
Larry Page
You can do the second one first, though.
Nikesh Arora
Okay, I think it is fair to say we do operate in China right now. We have an ad sales business. We have a display business in the market. We know there is many users who use Android devices in the market. I think what's important to understand is the reason we decided to not operate in China was because we believe that we wanted to make sure that users are able to have unfettered access to our products, and the products where we believe they have ability to access in an unfettered fashion we do operate in the market.
It's only the ones where they aren't able to access in the way we would like to, in which case they are able to access it through our operations in Hong Kong. So we think we operate in China, not in the way you might perceive it, but users have access to our services and there is even a small revenue business that we have in China.
Larry Page
Oaky, so, Patrick, what might be an impairment to us for Motorola?
Patrick Pichette
Obviously, every time there is any formal kind of transactions or events that occur, we have to look at our balance sheet and if is any impairment test. In the case of Motorola, we don't think there is actually right now. We have no information even with the Standards-Essential Patent. There is no information right now that leads us to believe that we have to do an impairment test on any of it.
Remember that the Standards-Essential Patent for Motorola is a very small portion of the entire portfolio pool of patents that we got out of Motorola. So, just put that in the context as well. So, thanks for your question, Richard. Why don’t we go to the next question, Jennifer.
Operator
We will take our next question from Neil Doshi with Citigroup.
Neil Doshi - Citi
Thanks. Can you provide more details around the policy changes that were implemented in the quarter, and whether they will continue to have an impact on CPCs and paid clicks in Q1?
Then also we were recently at the NRF convention in New York and we saw a demo of the Google Zavers product where users can click coupons, and then use those coupons in the offline retail world. How big of an opportunity is really bridging the online ads with off-line transactions for Google and this is something that's a key initiative as we go into 2013? Thanks.
Larry Page
Thanks, Neil, for your question. So I think that Nikesh can give us some color on the policy.
Nikesh Arora
I think it's fair to say what we did was, we’ve always had a policy. The policy has been that we want to make sure that whatever ads are presented in whatever way our traffic is routed to ads, it is done in the best interest of the user and we began to notice that they were sites and pages whereas we had too many ads in a page, so it became more restrictive and updated our policies for better enforcement and that has resulted in higher quality results for end users, it has reduced in some cases the monetization that some of our partners are seeing as a result of this enforcement and hence you are seeing the impact on the numbers.
We just announced this policy sometime early this quarter, in the past quarter that we just went through, so you are going to see the impact over the next few quarters. We've also implemented more stringent policies around downloadable apps, and that's why I think both those effects are going to stay with us for the year, but we think in the long-term is the right answer for us, it's the right answer for users and it's right answer for advertisers, so we think it's a good thing to do.
Larry Page
We've been doing things like that for a while just making sure we are focused on user experience in our advertising products and we found that that's been a very good long-term focus for our business that has really benefitted us. I think that's kind of the ordinary course of it there.
You mentioned bridging online ads with offline transactions. As I said mobile will increase the value of these kind of businesses. That's an example of it, which can actually measure if somebody gets an offer that they redeemed it in a real store or they went in the store or whatever it is. And so, we are very excited about that, but we’re still in the early stages of really making those solutions work for consumers, advertisers and so on, but I think it's a great area that you highlighted that.
So, can we go to our next question?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Hi, great. I had a question for Larry. I was just wondering if you could share with us your initial thoughts on the Google Fiber rollout. And also if you could outline for us your vision for the product if you look out over the next few years and how this might fit into your opening comments about multiple screens and unprecedented change in the consumer compute arena?
Larry Page
Well, I think it's been great to see the success there with the initial Fiber rollout. We are still in the very early stages of it. Obviously, we are going to a small number of people and so on, but we are excited about the possibilities there of getting people kind of give you the experience and really great Internet experience.
Patrick, do you want to add anything there?
Patrick Pichette
Yes. We are really focused on Kansas City right now and you've probably seen in the press. It's called now the Silicon Prairie. It's got a lot of press, because we've started to roll out, we started the implementation and the installs. We are growing up in terms of installs weeks after week and people just love the product. So, you are absolutely right, Heather, that we are really excited about this product and it's been a great success overall.
So, while we are going to continue and as we've said all along, and here is another great example of one where it's not a hobby, we really think that we should be making good business with this opportunity and we are going to continue to look at the possibility of expanding, but right now we just got to nail because we are in the early days. We just got to nail Kansas City. It's a perfect place for us to kind of debug all of the elements of the product and the experience for the users, but all-in-all, what a great opportunity to deliver kind of 100 times the average speed and that's what people are just dying to get everywhere. We have time for probably one last question.
Larry Page
Sorry I missed the second part of the question too, but it's a pretty big question, you wanted me to outline the vision for the products looking over the next few years. I guess the best way to predict the future is to make it, so that's what we are trying to do. I don't have anything specific to announce this time, but I couldn't be more excited about some of the things I mentioned on Google Now of really understanding  what your question is before you have it. Wouldn't that be great at the earnings call if we just answered all of your questions without you asking them, because that will be less work for you all. So, I think some of those things could really be reality and I think if you look at knowledge panels and I recently asked like really obscure question I was looking at the height of a bridge. I was like what's the height of the bridge? And I typed into the Google and it just spit out the answer, and I was dumbfounded you know but I didn't have to go and research that.
So, I think some of those things would seem kind of like science fiction where we are really getting to Google apps. Sergey has really taken on and he used to think that was science fiction and he is running around with it wearing it, as am I sometimes as well. So, I think we are just really excited about the future and I think the rate of innovation in the world is increasing, and also I think Google and that's just really exciting place to be.
Patrick Pichette
We actually saw Sergey in New York last weekend, in the subway with his plastic bags and all. So we have time for one last question.

We will take our last question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Great, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you about Display to start. I think in the last couple of years you have given a run rate in 4Q. I was hoping you could do that again for this past quarter and then also just talk about the early feedback and contribution from the YouTube App on iOS and then lastly any update on the features, timing and the process there? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So let me just jump on display. As we said many times in the past, we will give occasionally kind of numbers here and there just to give a sense of momentum, but we don't give them quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year. So that's exactly the case for display. And in the case of early feedback on the contribution for YouTube App on iOS, I will leave it to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
We are very excited about the iOS app that we put out there, not just for YouTube but also for Google Maps. We think they both have tremendous amount of success and it's an illustration of how, if you focus on the user and produce a great experience, it doesn't matter what platform it is. People will adopt it and adapt it and take to it. I think our partners and we both are excited about that fact that these apps are successful. I don't think it's just a unilateral view. Back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Sorry, I just saw, Doug, your question on the C Shares. Look, as we said previously, this recapitalization is subject to (inaudible) pending litigation right now and once the litigation has been resolved, we expect our Board of Directors to determine the exact timing of issuing the dividend. So, we can't really predict it yet, because it's litigation, but we don't expect it to occur before the second quarter of this year. That's where we stand on that.
With that, I just want to thank everybody who joining us today on the call. Wish everybody a really prosperous and happy new year. As Nikesh and Larry said, two-thumps up to all our Googlers for a phenomenal 2012 and making it a place of choice and look forward to an exciting 2013.
With that Jennifer, I am going to let you close the call.

Patrick Pichette
Hello, everybody. We’re going to invite Larry to give us the first round of commentary and then I’ll go through our financials and then Nikesh will have some comment before we turn to Q&A. So here you go, Larry.
Lawrence Page
Thank you, Patrick. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. It’s great to be on the call today and to share our progress since we last spoke six months ago. As you can hear my voice is still hoarse, so I will keep my remarks reasonably short. I am sorry for the scramble earlier today. As our printers have said, they hit send on the release just a bit early.
We had a strong quarter, I am really happy with our business. Revenue was up 45% year-on-year, and at just 14 years old, we cleared our first $14 billion revenue quarter. Not bad for a teenager. Today, we live in a world of abundance; abundant information and abundant computing. Most of us carry at least one device, all the time, every day. In fact many of us would feel naked without our smartphone. It’s hardly surprising mobile search queries and mobile commerce are growing dramatically across the world.
And we use these devices interchangeably, depending on our situation. I switch between my Nexus phone, my Nexus 7 tablet and my new Chromebook that we just announced today many times a day. While this abundance causes disruption, it also creates amazing opportunity. And Google is super well-placed to take advantage of these disruptive opportunities.
Why? Because our search query volumes have grown this quarter as measured year-over-year. And we are seeing tremendous innovation in advertising, which I believe, will help us monetize mobile queries more effectively than desktop today. Indeed, our mobile monetization per query is already a significant fraction compared to desktop. In short, as we transition from one screen to multiscreens, Google has enormous opportunities to innovate and drive ever higher monetization, just like Search in 2000.
Now we took a big bet on Android back in 2005. We believed that aligning standards around an open source operating system would drive innovation across the industry. Most people thought we were nuts. Today, there are over half a billion Android devices, half a billion, with 1.3 million more being activated every day. You should all run out and buy the Nexus 7 tablet for $199. It’s had rave reviews and recently won Gadget of the Year from T3, the gadget experts. You’ll love the integration with Google Play. It is an amazing device.
This time last year, I announced that our run-rate for mobile advertising hit $2.5 billion. That seemed like a pretty big number even for Google. But now we have built up additional mobile revenue from users paying for content and apps in Google Play. Including these new sources grossed up, I can announce our new run-rate for mobile is now over $8 billion. That’s quite a business.
We have so many opportunities today, that unless we prioritize we spread ourselves too thin. Last month, we sunset another 19 products. We’ve now closed or have combined 60 products and features in the last year. And we’ve put a ton of energy into ensuring that our remaining products work really well together. Because as screens multiply, it’s more important than ever that we converge our services.
Users want one consistent, beautiful and simple Google experience. Technology should do all the hard work, liberating users to get on with the important things that matter in their lives and this screen independence is at the core of our strategy.
Take Chrome on Android, for example. We only launched in February, but the experience is already amazing. When you are using Chrome, switching devices is truly painless. All your tabs are there, ready to go. Search on your desktop and the result is right there on your smartphone. You can even click the back button, and it just works. And as more users upgrade to Google+, it’s now over 400 million, users are enjoying amazing experiences across devices like instant photo upload.
In the same way, we want to make advertising super simple for customers. Online advertising has developed in very device specific ways, with separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This makes arduous work for advertisers and agencies, and means mobile opportunities often get missed.
So we’re working to significantly simplify the campaign experience, working very hard on that. Advertisers should be free to think about their audience, while we do the hard work of dynamically adapting their campaigns across devices. I’m very excited about this.
I talked at the start about the abundance of information. In the early days of Google, you would type in a query, we’d return ten blue links, and you move on fairly happily. Today, you expect more. You expect Google to understand deeply and you expect us to turn your intentions into actions in the blink of an eye.
If you search for Tom Hanks movies, chances are you want movies with Tom Hanks and thanks to our Knowledge Graph that’s what we show now, right from the results page: clean, fast, and organized. And if you’re shopping, say for Ugg boots, we now give you pictures, details about the different boots, prices and information about the local inventory, again right from the results page, clean, fast, and organized. There’s much more we can do to get you the right information at just the right time.
You might have a really important event in the city perhaps a first date, and the traffic is bad. You need to leave early to avoid being late. Or maybe you’ve just landed in a new country and you’re at the airport ATM trying to figure out how much cash to withdraw? Google Now, which we launched on Android in June, gives you all that information and more automatically, with zero effort required on your part.
It’s still early days, but these kinds of tips and recommendations are super powerful. They really save users time and hassle. This is why I’m incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead, given our expertise in Search and Mobile, and our track record monetizing high usage products.
Everyday, I wake up and I’m delighted that our opportunities keep growing. And that we’re birthing to our users great products that are defining the future. It’s a truly exciting time to be at Google.
And now, you will hear from Patrick some details about our quarter.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we are very pleased with the growth trajectory of our business this quarter and this in fact despite significant currency fluctuations in many of our international markets.
So for example, if currencies had remained constant year-over-year, our consolidated revenue growth would actually have been 6% higher. On a positive note, our U.S. growth continues to be strong. And as Larry noted, we’ve got a great quarter on the product front gaining traction in a number of critical areas.
So before I dive into the financials, I just want to give you a bit more detail on the new $8 billion annual mobile run rate that Larry mentioned. The new run rate is different from the one we gave you a year ago. And more specifically, last year, it included only our gross revenue from mobile ads, but this year, in this number we also added the gross revenue from the mobile sales of Google Play content. And finally, it also includes the consumer spending on the Play apps.
So with that and now why don’t I just jump into our financial performance. Our total gross consolidated revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $14.1 billion and that’s also 15% quarter-over-quarter. Google’s Standalone revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $11.5 billion, 5% quarter-over-quarter. In that, our Google Website revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, 2% quarter-over-quarter, with strengths across most major geographies and verticals.
Our Google Network grew 21% year-over-year to $3.1 billion and 5% quarter-over-quarter. And our other revenue grew 73% year-over-year to $666 million, 52% quarter-over-quarter and this driven by the Nexus 7 sales.
If it were not for these currency fluctuations, Google Standalone revenue would actually have grown 24% year-over-year. As Larry mentioned, Google Standalone business continues to perform very well. A dramatic growth in our new devices is driving mobiles queries and clicks. And although it’s early days, some of our existing ads have better monetization in desktop already today and we’re confident that this transition opens a whole new space for innovation and new format and future monetization.
Turning to MMI, Motorola gross revenue was $2.6 billion. The mobile device division revenue for that period was $1.8 billion and the home division revenue was $797 million, but we’re really pleased with Motorola’s progress in its 150 days.
As indicated in our public filings, our team has made a lot of operational changes, we harmonized and narrowed the product portfolio, there’s been streamlining of software operations and we scale back the markets in which we operate. But that said, we are just at the beginning of the Motorola Google story. And we should expect, as I mentioned before, results from this segment to be quite variable for quite a while yet. Remember that we inherited an entire product pipeline where hardware business cycles are typically in a 12 months to 18 months.
At Google, our aggregate paid click growth was very strong again this quarter up 33% year-over-year, 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate CPC or cost-per-click was down 15% and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. But once again please remember that currency headwinds also had a significant negative impact on our CPCs in Q3. In fixed FX terms, aggregate CPC would have been down only 8% almost half of the 15% and down only 1% quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to geographic performance of Google Standalone business, we continue to see robust performance in the U.S., the UK and Japan. On the other hand, we felt the continued impact of the economic situation in continental Europe, but we’ve seen pressure in sectors like travel and retail.
In our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor Relations website, you’ll see that we’ve broken down our revenue by U.S., UK and rest of world, to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
Revenue from the U.S. was up 23% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. The UK was up 16% to $1.2 billion, which includes $6 million of benefit from our hedging program and in FX term; in fact the UK grew 20%. The non-U.S. revenue excluding the UK accounted for 42% of our total revenue or $4.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year, but in fixed terms, in fact was 26%. And all this includes a $56 million benefit from our hedging program.
So let’s come back now to an aggregate level for total consolidated business. Our other cost of revenue was $3.6 billion in Q3 excluding our stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $2.9 billion, which again excludes SBC and the restructuring and related charges recorded in our Motorola business. And our non-GAAP operating profit was therefore $3.8 billion in Q3, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 27%.
For Google Standalone, our traffic acquisition costs were $2.8 billion or 25.5% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.6 billion and that excludes $103 million of stock-based compensation. The increase year-over-year in this other cost of revenue was driven by data center costs, equipment costs and including costs associated with the sales of the Nexus 7, and finally, content acquisition costs.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.2 billion, excluding again SBC of $585 million. And finally, our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q3 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 34% for Google Standalone. Lastly many of you’ve asked for the depreciation and amortization expense on PPE for standalone Google, which was $465 million for this quarter.
If we flip to Motorola, our total non-GAAP operating expenses including cost of revenue totaled $2.7 billion for the quarter. And keep in mind, that intangible amortization expenses attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola are included in these non-GAAP measures. And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss of Motorola was $151 million for Q3, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 6% for that segment.
Let’s switch over to headcount. For the consolidated business, it decreased by roughly 1,000 in Q3. Standalone Google added about 1,800 people. And remember that historically, we often see some seasonal effects on the hiring in Q3 as folks that we hired in the spring and early summer actually start working in September. In total, the consolidated company ended up the quarter around 53,500 full-time employees.
Our effective tax rate for this quarter was 22% in Q3, the changes from last quarter reflects the mix shift in earnings between the domestic and international subsidiaries and our hedges, but finally, fewer capital gains offsets versus last quarter.
If you allow me to turn to cash management, OI&E or other income and expenses was $62 million, which reflect the continued impact of our FAS 133 expenses of our hedging program, but also fewer capital gains versus last quarter. For more detail on OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
Operating cash flow was very strong, $4 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $872 million versus last quarter’s $774 million. The majority of our CapEx spent is in – continues to be related to production equipment and facilities related purchases. All this actually delivers us a free cash flow, which was $3.1 billion with which we’re quite pleased.
The success of our product really gives us the confidence to continue to fund the strategic growth areas, areas that Larry talked about such as Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome, and as always we continue to show our discipline in making the touch calls on products that just don’t live up to our expectations. In Q3, we’ve seen a number of these decisions including the sunset of our Google TV Ad as an example.
So with that, I will hand it off to Nikesh, who will cover more detail on our business performance in the quarter. And after his remarks, we’ll open up the phones for Q&A. Nikesh, here’s to you.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. I’d like to reiterate what Patrick said. Our business had a strong quarter with $11.5 billion in Google Standalone gross revenue. I want to talk to you about our focus and progress on four major trends that are actually helping to drive our business growth.
First, a trend Larry already talked about, the rise of the multiscreen consumer. This is creating huge opportunities for us especially in our advertising business and focus on video and mobile. At the moment, everybody thinks about the online world is divided into desktops and mobile. Larry shared the amazing $8 billion run rate. And I believe in the medium-term, these screens will continue to diverge, but advertising opportunities will converge to allow our marketers to run common campaigns across all these screens.
Our teams have been putting the same focus on mobile and video the last few quarters that we brought to display a few years ago. And it’s rewarding to see it bear fruit. We’ve intensified trading for our sales team across the globe, integrated sales tools, so we can really bring our customers’ mobile video, Search, Display as a cohesive solution. We're also educating our advertisers through initiatives like Go Mobile to ensure they have the right creators and landing pages to make mobile truly work for them.
However, we feel the progress we’ve made is just the very first step in the journey of monetizing many screens Larry talked about. As we develop advertising that can take advantage of the context in which consumers use this many screens, we expect to continue to see better monetization. As we help marketers reach consumers closer to the point of purchase, the opportunities will only get bigger.
We’re already seeing glimpses of this. Take T-Mobile, who use location based mobile ads to drive people nearby into their stores, and in their words, win the last 10 feet. They achieved a click-through rate of about 13%, in what is a very successful strategy. These rates are 3 to 4 times of what you would see without using some of these context. And our Click-to-Call ads work because consumers can respond by contacting an advertiser immediately from the ad, generating approximately 20 million phone calls per month for our clients through our various call products of advertising.
The second trend, which I’m excited about is, it’s not just the context that matters, but also our ability to deliver more precise answers to consumers, something also that Larry talked about. We are working very hard in this. Larry talked Google Now and Knowledge Graph; it’s exciting to see how that even makes opportunities for us happen, as Search become smarter in a commercial environment. We can do a better job of connecting marketers with consumers in the moments that matter, irrespective of what device they are using.
For example, we’re pleased that as of yesterday, Google Shopping completed its transition to a fully paid model based on product listing ads. Now we’re providing product information, pictures, pricing, local inventory information, over billion products from tens of thousands of merchants and over 100,000 sellers. So the new Google Shopping experience, Adorama, one of the US’s largest photo retailers and mail order suppliers saw their click-through rate jump by 176%. Their conversion rate went up by 100% in June as compared to near earlier.
Using the same technology that powers our Knowledge Graph, we’re providing better answers with Google Shopping in other areas where users want to make a purchase. We’re going to reduce the number of steps from search to transaction, making the online experience even more valuable to consumers and marketers.
The third trend, which I’m excited about is that we’re actually making real headway amplifying offline brand campaigns with online media. We have a unique approach that helps advertisers succeed across media. We allow them to use and leverage the attributes of each media and adapt their campaigns for online success. YouTube energized by new professional content and Display are the core of this business helping clients increase awareness, increase capability, and also drive engagement.
In addition, we also continue to make progress in our end-to-end technology platform to help advertisers of all sizes succeed with display advertising. Today, our top partners in the agency world and very large advertisers and publishers, are using a consistent technology stack. The number of impressions that we’ve been able to pass through AdX and Invite platforms have doubled over the last year.
We are also working on creating more video premium inventory without channel strategy in YouTube as more and more viewers move to online video, we expect more and more brands will do the same.
Our brand business is actually creating quite a buzz in the industry because we have great media and our solutions really work. For example, on YouTube, we looked at about 92 different ad campaigns with sales impact, we found that an average spending on YouTube was approximately 2.4 times more efficient than the equivalent television spent.
We have 200 times more video advertisers than the average U.S. television network. In our TrueView format, in which advertisers only pay for ads that users watch has really taken off. We have twice as many advertisers using TrueView since last year. That’s a very important statistic, but like any good brand marketer, the best way for me to show you – tell you a story is to actually show it. So let’s see what two of our leading brands have done this quarter.
We launched the YouTube Gillette Football Club with Procter & Gamble in Europe, we’ve created global brand platform for Gillette that will reinvent the way people watch football online. The campaigns have generated about $30 million video views. We are working with Coca-Cola on their Vitaminwater branding effort. We’ve partnered to build a strategic music program leveraging YouTube as a platform to anchor, distribute and syndicate the video content. It’s particularly exciting to see that over 100 brands now have over 1 million followers in Google+ including ESPN, PlayStation, Ferrari, H&M, Burberry and Toyota.
Last trend I want to talk about is the trend of cloud computing in the enterprise. Our enterprise business continues to thrive. We saw especially great traction in retail and education sectors this quarter with Dillard's, Kohl's, and Office Depot, all using Google Enterprise products.
In education, there are over 20 million students, faculty and staff, non-Google apps, Princeton, Virginia Tech, and even the Philippines Department of Education which has over 600,000 users.
With the recent launch of Google+ for enterprise customers, organizations of all size – sizes including capital and Banshee Wines are starting to use our Hangouts and other tools to work together and get things done from anywhere.
In addition to all these trends, our marketing team continues to do an excellent job. We launched a global cross-product initiative to bring the 2012 Olympics to our users worldwide. YouTube streamed the games like to 64 countries. Also YouTube was the efficient live streaming provider with over 1 million hours of live content for the democratic and republic of national conventions. And we passed yet another milestone just this week and YouTube broke it’s own record to reach more than 8 million concurrent live streams of Felix Baumgartner’s recording breaking leap from space with the Red Bull Stratos mission.
So with that as an update, I'm going to hang your back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. So Jennifer, if you would like to tell us the rules we will just get on for the Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross A. Sandler – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks guys. Nikesh, one quick question on revenue and Patrick one on expenses. The international and rest of world organic growth was 26% pretty strong, but down from 29% last quarter. So is there any incremental weakness that you saw or was this just mostly from a tougher comp? And then Patrick, your sales and marketing expense was up 18% from last quarter that's a bit higher than the typical increase in 3Q, can you talk about what’s driving up those investments? Thanks guys.
Patrick Pichette
Okay, I’ll start, Nikesh and I are pointing at each other. Yeah, on the marketing expense listen, I think what you see is the impact of the support for the Nexus 7 that we launched in Q3. Otherwise everything was pretty much in line with what we would expect. We just got such a great review of the Nexus 7, we won the support of the market and that's the biggest delta you will see in that number.
In terms of the market, I’ll hand it over to Nikesh for his commentary.
Nikesh Arora
I think it's fair to say that, our revenue growth internationally has been pretty strong. You are seeing some pockets of difference in performance partly because of seasonal reasons and partly because of the continuing economic effects you’re seeing in Europe. So our business is doing better than the economy in most markets in Europe, but it does get impacted a little bit with some of the fluctuations you see there. So from our perspective there is no any cause for concern.
Ross A. Sandler – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, guys.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Ross. Jennifer, let’s go to the next caller please.

And we will take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott W. Devitt – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, thanks. Just wondering if you could talk a little more about the strategy behind the decision to monetize product listing ads and then more broadly about the retail strategy for the company? And then secondly, Google website revenue net of distribution tax lowered to 13% from 20% last quarter, I was wondering if possible you could Patrick normalize that for currency to get a better understanding of FX neutral for website growth? Thank you.
Lawrence Page
Hello Scott, this is Larry. On this question about the strategy and product listings, I think we’re just really excited about providing a better experience for our customers. When they search for something I mention boots on the call, now you search for that, I think you'll see a well organized set of product information, ways to buy it and really have a great experience there. And we see, our ability to do that on the ads or monetized product listing side, it’s really helping us provide a better user experience and provide a better advertiser experience. So I’m very excited about that. I think we are still in the early stages of that. We just launched, I think yesterday really and we still got ways to go. So I'll let Nikesh or Patrick take the next question.
Patrick Pichette
On your question relative to our Google site and tech, I’m not – could you just repeat your question, I not sure, I understood what you meant?
Scott W. Devitt – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I’m just trying to understand better the – you suggested the 600 basis point effect from currency and I was just wondering if there is a better way to understand the way that currency effected Google site revenue, if I should think of that any differently than the overall currency?
Patrick Pichette
I see, so no, it's even the, I mean we have – our network is slightly skewed to the US versus our Google site, so you’ll have some mixed effect there because our network is slightly skewed to the US, but overall I think that it still gives you a good sense of proportion as to what's going on in the market. So that’s the way I would kind of think about it from a model point of view.
Lawrence Page
Let me just add – now it’s on the first part of the question, I think we are really trying to provide answers to people and so, and the strategy for the company really looking at very detailed information and giving you the exact right answer, what we’re doing with knowledge [tides] [ph]. And in search, I wanted to do the same thing as with our advertising to make sure that we get you, as a user in the right answer. And I think that's a very exciting sort of a new strategy for us.
Scott W. Devitt – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks Scott. Jennifer, let's go to the next question please.

Next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark S. Mahaney – Citigroup
Great, thanks. Two questions please mobile searches are really strong, what’s happening with desktop searches. At some point it's probably reasonable to assume that they’re flat lined, we already reach that. And on the expense side if we just looked at the core Google it looks like the margins are coming down, but if you did roughly $200 million may be in Nexus revenue and if you really sold those devices at cost then margins are actually better than they have been in two year, which is the more accurate interpretation? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Actually, let me start with the margins and then I will answer your first question. On the margins you actually have a couple of effects this quarter, one of them, is clearly as you said the cost of the Nexus that will flow into our other cost of revenue, but also it's the first time that you have the full quarter effect of the amortization of intangibles from the Motorola transaction.
So that is also another big kind levered that actually kicked in. and it should noted just for the financial community that the amortization of intangibles for Motorola flows to both the Google segment and the Motorola segment in different proportion. So again, it’s pretty tough, as I promised you that we’d have a lot of kind of noise in the data, I think that’s a good set of indication. And for the first one, why don’t I let Larry give a few comments on the issue of mobile.
Lawrence Page
So I guess, I feel like you are asking the wrong question a little bit. I think we are really starting to live in the new reality, one where the kind of ubiquity of the screens helps users really move from intent to action much faster and more seamlessly. So I think this will create a huge new universe of opportunities for advertisers where they can focus on platform. Focusing on platform specific queries won’t make us much sense because advertisers will be dynamically adopting across a whole bunch of different devices to reach the right audiences at the right time.
And that’s kind of how we are thinking about it and I alluded to changes that we'll make – to our ads system to improve the advertiser experience and the user experience around that. And I also think that, we are just seeing tremendous growth in the Android, which really obviously we have tremendous ability to influence and to improve the user experience, to add location, to notify your things as I mentioned around different kinds of non-commercial experiences. We can notify you of commercial experiences as well.
So I think that’s a really big and great opportunity for us. And as I’ve said, that monetization on mobile queries right now is a significant fraction of desktop. So we're kind of living the best of both worlds, we’re able to move our existing ads, our existing monetization over to mobile. And lastly in order to really innovate using Android and our strength of having ads on other mobile platforms and really move advertisers and consumers who into a new world. So  I think we are uniquely positioned to get through the transition and it’s really profit from it. So I am just incredibly excited about that.
Mark S. Mahaney – Citigroup
Thanks for the correction Larry.

Thanks. Jennifer let’s got to our next question please.

Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi, two questions, if you run a website with proprietary high quality content today and have to choose a protocol to add, meta data about this content, why would the clear choice would be the Open Graph protocol instead of RDF or one of it’s variables and if that happens and the semantic web arises on the back of open graph doesn’t it place Google at a fundamental disadvantage to achieve the vision that Larry laid out in the beginning of the call. The second question is what do think is the future of vertical search and why is that there are sites that specialize in certain vertical such as travel and local, that seem to do a better job than Google today and if this is going to change over time and what happens with vertical search? Thank you.
Lawrence Page
Yeah, Carlos, I’ll take those questions. I think if you  - I'm not an expert on the protocols you’re talking about, I think in general we made a huge investment in knowledge graph and really understanding in detail about everything. And that’s a major effort for us, and we’d obviously love to have other people help us with that. I think it’s been a little bit of a challenge in the past to get all the labeling aligned and all those things. I think we have a big part to play in that. We’re absolutely very excited about that and I think we’re going to do a lot work in that area. And I think we’re doing well in that space.
Vertical searches, as you asked about, I think our goal has always been to get you to the right place, but we also – to do that we need to really understand in detail, your context, what you need, what’s really going on with that information, if it’s airline tickets, what are the flights between, what do they cost, products, some one selling we need to know how much they cost to get to know what the shipping is and so on. So I think any place we can get that information accurately, we can present it to our users. However we are very happy to do so.
In general, we found that we knew it’s really, build more of that experience in order to provide a really high quality experience to our users. But again, we’re always open alsoto working with partners.

And we will take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Ben Schachter – Macquarie Research Equities
One question for Larry and then a couple of housekeeping points on the Apple relationship for Patrick. Larry, there is a lot of this talk about internet use on mobile devices, but switching gears a little, I just wonder if you could talk about the potential for internet access on television screens and how Google might benefit from that? And then Patrick, just two quick housekeeping questions on Apple. One, is 100% of the TAC that you pay, Apple recognized in the Google.com TAC line, and then on iOS 6 there is a seemingly small change in the default search bar right now, says the word search where they used to say Google. How does if at all that change the economic relationship between Apple and Google? Thanks.
Lawrence Page
Okay, so Ben thanks for the question. I mean, obviously we were exited about television, television screens, displays and we have been for a while. We’ve had Google TV, it was a product for quite sometime, I’d just say, I love it and I think it’s a great time to have a real browser, mail on your television, easily access You Tube and all those kind of things.
YouTube is integrated on many, many devices from DVD players and so on to game consoles and things like that. So we obviously are working hard to get distribution for YouTube, for Chrome and for the internet as a whole on television screens, as well as our own products, and we’re very excited about that. I think we are obviously still in the early stages of that, something we really has a great user experience, and we work hard to make that happen.
Patrick Pichette
On the – sorry, just want to talk about the TAC line and just to say that, yes, I mean obviously all the TAC that we paid to Apple, it is just another partner for distribution, so it all is tied to our – the TAC line that we have for Google.com. On your question of the default, I mean although there is – nothing is changed, right, I mean, when you use Google, we are a great partner with Apple, we’re a great partner with many of them, and in doing so, when you do search, I mean we have a great, we have the – the fact that they’ve changed from Google to search is still kind of run by our engines. So I hope that clarifies the point Ben.
Ben Schachter – Macquarie Research Equities
Okay, thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Ben. Jennifer let’s go to the next question please.

Next question come from Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.
Anthony Diclemente – Barclays
Hi, thanks. I started to harp on the CPC question, but you mentioned them being down 8% XFS. Can you just Patrick, talk a little bit about the other drivers, I think everybody assumes that the bulk of the down 8% is mobile, but I know there are other factors driving that down 8%, so if you could just kind of give us order of magnitude in emerging markets and so forth if possible?
And then secondly, on allocation of your sizable free cash flow and on your cash balance Patrick in the past you’ve talked about reviewing and considering capital returns at the Board level. And at the same time you’ve talked about your cash balance being a strategic asset for Google, just wondering if you could give us an update on yours, on Larry’s, Board’s thinking on allocation of capital and use of your cash balance? Thanks for the question.
Patrick Pichette
Yeah, listen, on the CPC trends nothing has changed from last two quarters. And in fact, I think people have a tendency just to harp and assuming that it’s automatically mobile…
Anthony Diclemente – Barclays
Right.
Patrick Pichette
And if you look through our results, I just kind of point to a few areas, if you look at our mix between our Google properties and our network, right, our network grew quite a bit again this quarter and that would drive a lot of pack as well. So I and again that’s the reason why I kind of want to educate and tell and remind everybody that just all of these mix effects whether it would be mobile versus laptop versus desktop, but also emerging market versus developed markets and also our Google.com versus network.
And then we haven’t even talked about the changes in our ads quality, which actually can change quite a bit as well. So I think that matters a lot, and I think that it’s really important now we understand that all these mix effects are actually playing or play there in the CPC. So and that’s what we don’t give, if we start giving down all the breakdown right, it’s just endless.
So for us, the real issue for us is, but what really matters is, they are going down, but on the flip side of that, right, given all these mix issues, what we really see is our pay clicks going up at a pretty healthy rate at 33% again this quarter, which actually gives you a sense of people who are engaged, people are using our products, it’s really about this transformation of multi-devices and in fact that there is a little bit less CPC is not a concern compared to all the offside that we see on the other side.
On the issue of our cash and capital balance, I think, you get the same answer and maybe Larry wants to kind of chime in if he wishes to, but we just review this on a constant basis. We ask ourselves the question, is there real options for us actually to use the cash from a strategic perspective and we’ve come to the conclusion that it is a real strategic asset for us right now with the ability to balance. And so we think it’s prudent to actually manage our capital structure to where it is as we speak.
Lawrence Page
We have nothing to announce at this time.
Anthony Diclemente – Barclays
Okay. Thank you very much.
Lawrence Page
Thank you. Thanks, Anthony.

Next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you for the question. I have two for Patrick and then one for Larry. Patrick, I’ll start out with yours first. Can you give us an idea of the run rate that you are talking about, the $8 billion for mobile, can you give us an idea of what that is on a kind of same-store sales basis, you gave us the $2.5 billion run rate last year, what is the mobile advertising piece, I think that’s something people are really interested in, so extra stuff from Google Play? The follow-up question I had for you was, what’s the margin profile on the Google Play content revenue that you’re recognizing? And then the question for Larry is, I guess just in listening to Mark Mahaney’s question, I was wondering in this new reality you mentioned in response to his question, how does Google Fiber play into this vision to have your content and search capabilities go across multiple screens? Thank you.
Lawrence Page
Okay, I’ll let Patrick, take the first part.
Patrick Pichette
Okay. So on the $8 billion, so let me give you just a bit more information on it, but clearly we don’t breakdown each of the categories, we just wanted to kind of give you a sense of proportion. A point that’s important is, of the three categories I gave you, ads continues to be the bulk of it, the vast majority of it. And then on the case of the Google Play, it’s important to note from a modeling perspective that everything’s that’s content, that is whether a book, a movie content is actually booked on our books on a gross basis.
Everything that is tied to apps is booked on a net basis, but it’s still a huge kind of number in all cases. So without giving you, I just want to give you that, so that you don’t start thinking that there is actually 8 billion that is book to revenue in our result that you see, but in fact, two of the three are there, the third one is done on a net basis, just because of our accounting rules. So and the vast majority is still ads.
Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs
And can you just give us a sense of the margin profile on the not ad piece?
Patrick Pichette
We don’t provide that. We don’t give any of the details of that. But clearly, it’s a different profile, because it’s content, so we have partnerships that we deal with.
Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs
Great.
Patrick Pichette
On the case of, why don’t I turn it over to Larry to talk about Google Fiber and Google TV.
Lawrence Page
Hi, Heather, it’s a great question. I think, Google Fiber I think we are in the early stages, right, it’s just rolling in out in one city or two cities that are one city. And we’re really excited about it and I’m excited about the user experience there. In fact, I think I’m about to go, went soon from my asked trials. But you control it with a Nexus 7 tablet actually, that’s the remote for it. I think it will be an amazing experience from a user standpoint, one that can really drive that industry forward. So are quite excited about that like said we are in the early stages, obviously rolling that up.
Patrick Pichette
It’s worth just to close on that. It’s worth kind of noting also that we are pushing for the next chapter of the internet in the U.S. with Google Fiber. People, there is such a demand for higher speed access at reasonable prices, I think that we got a great mouth trap with Google Fiber and we hope it excites everybody and promote the environment that will actually give us that kind of connectivity in the U.S. and elsewhere as well.
Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks. Jennifer, let’s go to a next question please.

Next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan
Douglas T. Anmuth – JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thanks. Just want to ask two questions. First is just following up on Scott’s earlier question, we saw a deceleration in Google Properties and then an acceleration on network side. But hoping that you could talk about a little bit beyond the U.S. and the international mix, is there anything else that you would attribute those dynamics to. And then secondly, you talked a lot about multiple screens and ambiguity of devices, how concerned are you that in a mobile world, behavior is different and we’re living in more of an apps-based environment and Google might not be that starting point for people on mobile devices. Thanks.
Lawrence Page
Yeah, thanks. That was a great question, Doug, I’ll take the second one first. I think a lots been made on that note, I don’t think that’s really true, kind of apps versus search. We obviously have a great position in apps, we have the Android Play Star, which has a huge number of apps. And I think that those experiences are good experiences and there are some things that are better than them, but to us some things that are better than the web of the apps. I think over time, we do our jobs right, you have the same capabilities in both places, and we have such ability in apps, you built some more usually good apps, the same way you go to webpage and so on. So I think anyway I think those differences will emerge or where it is tenures over time. I think we obliviously have a strong position in both.
So I’m not so worried about that. I think that there is obviously innovation that goes out of mobile and we talked a little bit about all the different context and location you could have on mobile, the fact they’re always carrying a device with you and those things are very powerful. So you want all that when you are on desktop seller on the web, you want that same information. And so we wanted a seamless experience that goes across both mobile and desktop and TV or whatever screens you have, and that’s what we are building. I think that we are going to see tremendous in these things.
The other point I make is that, there is a small, relatively small number of people right now that have Chrome on their mobile devices. And I find Chrome on my mobile device like the same is having a desktop computer a year ago or something. And it’s an amazing experience. You can buy things. It remembers your credit card numbers and that means it’s a very, very easy great experience. That’s been, that’s rolled up to a relatively small number of people, but it will be increasing quickly.
So I guess just seeing all those trends, I think it’s tremendous opportunity for us. And I don’t think people are really thinking about it correctly now. So Patrick, do you want the cover the detailed question?
Patrick Pichette
Yeah, with pleasure. Look just to reiterate that our Google website’s revenue was up and with strength across most geographies and most verticals. I mean obviously you’ve heard Nikesh talk about, Douglas, we can’t control the economy in the short term, so if there is a country that is slowing down a little bit then we clearly kind of see it in the result as well because Google is actually a pretty good protector of the present as far the economists are varying kind of reminds us. But then on the Google Network, I think we’re just really pleased with, it’s skewed slightly more to the U.S. but really pleased with the performance overall with all of our networks, that’s been performing well. So nothing additional to kind of highlight apart from just a good general trends.
Douglas Anmuth – JPMorgan
Okay. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Jennifer, our next question please?
Operator
Next question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete.
Richard Kramer – Arete Research Services LLP
Hi, thanks very much. I’ve got some, one question for each of you, if I may, for Larry if you could just expand a little bit more on YouTube and maybe provide not only some metrics, but really your may be three to five year vision of its rolling video distribution between Google TV and the fiber project and some of the other options. For Nikesh, could you talk a little bit about emerging markets and where Android really is the dominant not only in scale, mobile computing platforms, and what may drive that to show faster international growth, if its having sales force or purchasing power or something else and maybe Patrick, could you help us understand a little bit the FX headwind on the top line how it might have been expressed moving down the P&L especially in sort of net profit terms. Thanks very much.
Lawrence Page
Richard, that’s a great question on YouTube. I haven’t had, Nikesh mentioned Google TV for a while, I think recently kind of YouTube transition from maybe a year ago, to be really something that keeps me entertained for hours on the TV. It can play back, lots of really high quality, highly exciting things, they are now kind of tailored for me, my channels and so on and I think we have tremendously increasing YouTube usage, continues to grow like crazy. And we’ve head increasing monetization as well which causes people to put more content on it, and to monetize it worldwide, kind of in a blink of an eye you can put things up.
So I was just, the recent video of horse dancing, came in style. I have been watching, its 400 million views now – 500 million. And that kind of thing to really just put the switch, turn it on, get a worldwide distribution and sort of – almost without doing any work, if you are a provider of this content is an amazing thing. And I think that’s how we see the future, we’re just kind of continue to grow that. It is going to be available everywhere on your mobile, on your TV, on your desktop wherever you want. It’s going to keep track of the kinds of things you’re interested in and really provides you an amazing experience, and provide a great experience for the advertisers, true view is exploding, which gives us high quality ads from an end user standpoint, because they can skip some if they want. So it encourages paths that are actually entertaining, not annoying, and that’s been working or making money over that and it’s coming like crazy as well. So I couldn’t be more excited about all that.
Nikesh Arora
Thanks Richard. As far as the emerging markets in Android, I mean I think we’re very excited about the fact that Android is becoming very successful platform in many markets, outside the U.S. not just the U.S. I think in terms of what drive, I am not sure if your question is about faster growth of Android or faster growth of monetization on Android platforms. I think on both of them, we’re seeing the adoption in various markets, there OEMS are producing Android devices on the bleeding edge and doing a phenomenal job of working with operators in those market and distributing them, so we think that will continue because and Android is providing to be a great platform for innovation for all the OEM.
In addition to that as more and more people use mobile device, I think we’ve talked a lot in this call about have those mobile devices are being used, we are seeing an increasing in query growth and we are seeing our various new ad formats and ads where we bring context into account is actually helping us monetize. So I think both those trends are going in the right direction. Hopefully that provides more opportunity for us.
Patrick Pichette
Let me close on FX, so Richard, just two points, one is, it’s been interesting in Q3, the U.S. dollar has really weakened versus a whole host of currencies, so typically you have one currency that goes down another one is more stable, we’ve really seen it across-the-board, it just happens with the macro economic trend, again, it’s something you can’t predict. So it’s been across-the-board and without giving you the details of how it flows to margins, it is fair to say and we’ve already talked in the past that our operating expenses are skewed to the U.S. I mean Mountain View is the headquarter and so from that perspective it has some effect as well. So I think you can navigate through this. So it was definitely a significant impact for this quarter.
Anthony Diclemente – Barclays
Okay. Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Richard. Jennifer, let’s go to our next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Patrick Pichette
Justin, are you with us?
Justin Post – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Can you hear me now?
Patrick Pichette
We can.
Justin Post – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
On a high level, I just want to know, if searches on mobile the same quality in your estimate as PC I mean are you still getting good high CPC travel and e-commerce searches on mobile? Second, maybe you could talk a little bit about the rollout of Google product search seeing those ads definitely in core search results and could that have an impact in Q4?
And then maybe some detail on the hedging program, this is one of your worst year-over-year hedging, I’m sorry, one of your worst year-over-year FX impacts down $500 million and now you get a $62 million benefit and I think you disclosed the cost was 124. I guess there is there something you can do to kind of improve that the ratio is there and not spend so much and a get a better benefit win FX is negative thanks.
Lawrence Page
Yes, Justin thanks for the question. I don’t know the details of the particular queries on the Google Desktop, but I can tell you I think like for example in Travel we bought IT software for a sizable amount, we thought it was important to provide a better experience there, when you type cities and you want an airline ticket, you actually need that detailed information, and I think I’m not worried about any of that to the extend we provide great an amazing user experience for people. However they are looking for all types of different kinds of information as long as we’re providing again that very detailed, very organized customer results of people, I think that translates across all of your screen is just fine. Nikesh or Patrick, do you want to?
Patrick Pichette
Again jumping on to the FX issue if you don’t mind, look I think that it’s interesting your question Justin, but let’s remind ourselves of a couple of points, because I think our FX program has actually delivered amazing value to shareholders. One is, we don’t hedge revenue, we hedge profits. And we hedge a number of kind of major currencies like the Euro, the Pound, the Canadian Dollar, few others which is the core of our program, and not only but actually our hedge program is certainly designed for long-term kind of 18 months as a risk reduction strategy and doesn’t necessarily correlate in a way we should perform for three months kind of timeframe in our financial results. And it’s really also build to make sure, I guess you had a cost benefit ratio, thereof making sure that it’s set for bit dislocations.
So if it’s just a smaller variance in the short-term, you are not going to get us much benefit as it is a big dislocation. So for all these reasons and then what I mentioned a bit earlier, which is we’ve seen actually FX across a whole slue of currencies this quarter, which these smaller currencies just added up and we don’t hedge for them today. That’s what kind of ended up in the puzzle. So we are constantly looking at our forecast and if it makes sense we will actually throw in new currencies going forward. So that’s been the story on FX, but I wouldn’t read in anyway (inaudible) performed that it hasn’t performed well, it’s performed very low. So why don’t I turn it back over to Nikesh for the last question.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, in terms of the product listing ad as we talked about, we’re really excited that we actually went on a full rollout for product listing ads and as we’ve said we have 1 billion products that are in there. So as we’ve also, as Larry talked about getting more precise information. We believe that users when they search they come exploring on the web, when they have a better idea, what they are trying to buy. They start expressing intent by being more precise of what they ask for.
And we believe being able to do product listing ads gets us closer to intent because if somebody types a Nikon D800 then we know they are looking to buy or looking to get more information about a specific product and the fact that we can show them reviews pictures and pricing information gets us closer to action. And we believe in the medium term that’s going to create more monetization and a better monetization for us as opposed to having just 10 blue links of ads we’d send them to other websites. So I think that’s going to have a good impact in the medium term, I don’t think I’m going to comment whether that has an impact in Q4 or not.
Justin Post – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Justin, for your question. We will go for one last question. Jennifer, please?
Operator
We will take our last question from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
Brian Pitz – Jefferies & Co.
Great. Thanks. Larry, bigger picture question on your mobile comments, would you give us some rough sense of how long it could take to close the bulk of the gap between desktop and mobile monetization, is this a matter of quarters or years that will see that come together. And then maybe just you made a quick comment on travel weakness last quarter, I think you said travel was strong across the board. And then you came back today and said it sounds like that was a weaker category, just anymore color on the weakness of travel? Thanks.
Lawrence Page
Thanks Brian for the question. And we have kind of policy of not talking about the future, so I think it’s generally a good policy. I tend to be very impatient and I think, I kind of reiterate what I said that we are positioned well, very, very well, and uniquely well, because we have hardly very significant fraction to monetization on mobile and that’s a great start. And we’re working on changes, we do things we’ve been investing in this space for long, long time right, our mobile monetization is not zero, it’s a very significant number.
As we try to end also with $8 billion number. And I think that it’s kind of good pace there and I don’t think that the things we need to do are that huge, to have us in a very good spot and I think we have opportunity to be higher monetization than where we are now. Put some innovation which we’re kind of doing, it looks like that I’m very impatient and I think that, another point I make I guess that I’ve made already, I think that, advertisers are ads still requires they spend some metric to deal with mobile in general.
I think advertisers, mobile until very recently it’s been relatively small percentage of advertising spend from those advertisers. I think that’s starting to be in the long as the case, right, and that’s happening relatively quickly, and I think advertisers will also react to that, and you will see them invest, more efforts in targeting those users, running apps for them in phone which holds obviously benefit our monetization there. Actually we have a lot of trends working for us, so I am not worried about this in terms of our business at all. I think it’s more of an opportunity for us because we’re better positioned than most other companies. I guess (inaudible) estimate, short-term impact and I am quite impatient.
Patrick Pichette
If I can just close on just travel, I mean obviously there’s a couple of factors in there, one of them is clearly – there is seasonality in travel, so obviously that’s always an impact quarter-over-quarter, and then as we – the same news you read about Europe or other parts of the world that are in different economic situations. You will notice that if you kind of track Google Trends and you go and mine into the data, you will see that some sectors are performing better, others are not, and as I mentioned in my commentary, at the very beginning, travel and retail has been somewhat weak in Europe just given their situation, so no real surprises there Brian. Thank you for you questions.
Just before we close, I just want to take a ten seconds on behalf of Nikesh, Larry and myself thanking in the amazing work of our Googlers, all our employees, all our partners, what an amazing last 90 days it’s been both at Motorola and Google.
And I’ll let Larry close with the last words before we turn it over to Jennifer to close the call.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Google Inc. Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded.
At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Willa Lo, Investor Relations Manager. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Willa Lo
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today’s second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. With us are Pat Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer; Susan Wojcicki, Senior Vice President, Advertising.
Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So, please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google’s future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.
We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call to Larry.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Willa, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. So, well, this is a special call as we enter into a new chapter in our history at Google here with our recent acquisition of Motorola, and with it comes a new set of financial information for all you both at a consolidated, but also at the segment level.
So speaking of Motorola, it’s worth noting that given the recent close of the transaction, we can expect this specific segment of our financials to continue to show some accounting variability. So for example, this quarter it’s a stub period, so meaning it only reflects the results since the acquisition dates rather than the full quarter. And as a result of the close, we did a number of accounting adjustments typical for such transactions. So we’ll try to do our best to answer your questions on this call. And our investor relations team will also continue to support the analyst and the investor community during this transition.
So now, let’s quickly cover our consolidated result as well as segmented reporting for both Google and Motorola.
Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 35% year-over-year to $12.2 billion and 15% quarter-over-quarter. So again, please remember that these total consolidated numbers include the stub period for Motorola. Additionally, there was a significant year-over-year currency headwind in Q2. In fixed FX, revenue would have grown to 39% year-over-year instead of 35%.
Google on a standalone gross revenue grew 21% year-over-year to $11 billion and 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google website revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $7.5 billion and 3% quarter-over-quarter, which trends across most major geographies and verticals.
Google network revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $3 billion, and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our other revenue line grew by 42% year-over-year to $439 million and 5% quarter-over-quarter. It’s again worth noting that in fixed FX our revenue would have grown 25% year-over-year.
Motorola grew revenue for the stub period since May 22 at $1.3 billion. Our mobile devices revenue for that period was $843 million, encouraged by the strength of the North American Verizon franchise driven by the RAZR MAXX sales. Although we’ve seen also weaker revenues that were driven by the declining international sales of feature phones and mid-tier smartphones; the home business, revenue was $407 million.
So the core metrics of Google standalone business continue to perform very well against the backdrop of a somewhat difficult global economic environment. Our global aggregate paid-click growth was very strong, up 42% year-over-year, and also up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click growth was down 16% year-over-year, and up 1% quarter-over-quarter. And please remember that the currency headwinds also obviously had a quite negative impact on the CPCs in Q2.
Turning to geographic performance of Google standalone business, U.S., UK and rest of world are growing at a good pace as reflected in our results. In our earnings slides, which you’ll find in our Investor Relation website, you’ll see that we’ve broken down our revenue by U.S., UK and rest of world, to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for those exact calculation.
Revenue from the U.S. was up 20% year-over-year to $5 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 54% of our total revenue or $6 billion, and was up 22% year-over-year, which includes $81 million benefit from our hedging program. The UK was up 20% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, and then fixed FX term; in fact the UK grew 22%.
Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business; other cost of revenue was $2.3 billion in Q2. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $3.3 billion, which excludes stock-based compensation and charges related to the severance and benefit arrangements in connection with the Motorola acquisition of $652 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q2, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 32.3%.
For standalone Google, our traffic acquisition costs were $2.6 billion or 24.7% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.3 billion, and that's excluding SBC of $82 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.1 billion, also excluding SBC of $470 million.
Finally, non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q2, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 36.4%. This continued strong margin in our standalone Google business segment gives us the confidence to continue to fully fund our many strategic growth areas, such as mobile, Android, YouTube and Chrome. Obviously, Susan and Nikesh will go into more details of our initiatives in a minute.
At Motorola, our non-GAAP operating expenses including cost of revenue for the stub period were $1.3 billion. And keep in mind that, intangible amortization of expenses and the step-up cost attributed to standalone Google and Motorola are included in these non-GAAP measures. And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss at Motorola was minus $38 million in Q2 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of minus 3% for that specific segment.
Headcount increased roughly 21,500 in Q2, obviously Google itself added about 1200, while the remainder of this number includes the Motorola employees who joined in the acquisition. In total, the consolidated company ended the quarter at around 54,600 employees, full-time employees status.
Our effective tax rate was 19% in Q2, and that reflects not only the mix of our earnings between domestic, international subsidiaries and our hedges, but also capital gains offset by carried over capital losses.
Let me quickly turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $254 million for the quarter, which reflects gains related to a divestiture of a business, offset somewhat by lower interest income and by the impact of our FAS 133 expenses from our hedging program. For more details [underway any], please again refer to the slides of the company or call on our IR website. Operating cash flow was very strong at $4.3 billion for the second quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $774 million versus last quarter at $607 million. The majority of our CapEx was spent really related to production equipment, facilities, and man purchases. And obviously, we're pleased with our free cash flow, which was $3.5 billion.
So now, let me hand it over to Nikesh, who will cover more the details of our business performance in the quarter, then Susan will cover our product highlights. And then finally, we’ll open up the lines for your questions. And please note that Nikesh and Susan will discuss only the standalone Google business and not cover Motorola.
So let me turn it over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick, and hello everyone. Our business had a very strong quarter as you’ve heard with over $11 billion in revenue. I’m going to talk about three broad themes today. First, how our recent big bets in the ad business are coming together into integrated platforms. I think digital advertising is really in defrag mode.
secondly, we’ll take a look under the hood that how our investments and search advertising adds quality by helping our search business accelerate. And third, we’re going to talk a bit about our enterprise business, which I believe is reaching a real turning point, then I’ll discuss some ways for driving success for our customers and some marketing highlights.
So first, our big bets. In about four years, DoubleClick has gone from strength to strength at Google. Now it is the foundation of our display business. this quarter, we announced DoubleClick digital marketing, the first modern ad platform for the modern digital world. This was the biggest ever overall for DoubleClick ad platform. It is used by thousands of agencies and marketers and we managed billions in marketing spend across the world on this platform. It now spans the best of display, rich media, exchange buying, surge and measurement.
Some of our recent display acquisitions, Teracent and Invite Media, which both grew by over 50% last year, are also seamlessly integrated into this platform. At the same time, AdMeld, which we acquired, is helping provide publishers control, flexibility and more revenue opportunities. Our display platform helps direct response in brand marketers navigate the whole web.
For brands, this quarter we unveiled the Brand Activate initiative. As seas of measurement and planning solutions baked directly into our platform, with our partners are building an online measurement for GRPs or gross rating points in a way to measure viewable impressions. Effectively what we want to do is we want to drive more and more advertising dollars in the brand space and this platform is going to be an effective way for us and we’ll do that.
Recently InComm at a big advertising festival, creative agencies loved project [Rebif] this was one of our demos with the possibilities of how in modern digital marketing you can use multiple media formats to make advertising successful. That is quite a change from 2004 when our four line text ads weren’t quite as exciting.
Another big bet as part of our integrated solutions is YouTube. I think in 2007 it was when newspapers frequently said YouTube is groping for an effective business model. I think we can declare we found our model. YouTube now unites the world through video from the Human Rights channel launched this quarter to a (inaudible) study confirming YouTube as a major global news platform. And for the first time, YouTube will be powering NBC’s live streaming of the Olympics in the U.S. while also live streaming the games in London to 64 territories around the world.
Yearly account signups have doubled year-over-year and users are uploading over 72 hours of video every minute. This quarter we released a new YouTube app for Android helping users to find videos and follow channels from a mobile or tablet devices. We believe YouTube is now a proven winner for the whole video ecosystem. Thousands of partners are making six figures and we’re proud to work with major record labels in Hollywood studios on this platform.
In fact, earlier in May, we saw an incredible digital upfront of it, Ban Car, highlighting our YouTube programming partners. Slightly over 13,000 clients attended, some of the worlds biggest advertisers were there and they’re making significant commitments on YouTube including people like Unilever, AT&T and American Express. If you’re counting that’s five successful acquisitions well integrated and helping us succeed in the advertising space.
The sixth is Admob, which helps power our mobile ads, both across Android and IOS and other mobile platforms future. Admob was integrated this quarter into AdWords, this has further turbo charged our ability to provide in-house advertising. That’s more than a million advertisers with 300,000 mobile apps, 350 million devices at their finger tips.
The growth in the businesses with mobile website is stunning. Last quarter we rolled out GoMo which is the short for go mobile, that initiative was rolled out in 8 new countries including Germany, Japan and Brazil. Mobile friendly website are vital modern businesses and very important for our mobile search business. In less than one year the number of advertisers with mobile sites has doubled.
Other major upgrade to Google Analytics was made for mobile apps and the new AdMob SDK for developers turned out to an awesome quarter. For us mobile is like desktop was in 1999, smart marketers are getting great ROI and are developing native ad models that generate results for them. For example, we’ve had 15 million monthly calls for our click-to-call go format exclusively available in mobile devices in the US.
Let’s talk about my second theme, the secret souls of search advertising. This quarter showed why we’re so optimistic about search’s continued growth. You know about some factors that drive search, the overall move to digital media and new search ad formats.
Privacy, we often underestimate one factor that you don’t often read about. The amount of effort our product engineering teams put into the quality and precision for ads, that just keeps getting better. This quarter made 72 quality improvements and launched greater auctions transparency for search advertisers, effectively what results it improves the relevance of our add and making it more useful to consumers, it drives better results for our partners, clients and advertisers and it helps improve monetization.
Imagine if every single search ad was a perfect answer that drove the conversion for the customer, I think that’s the objective that our teams are aiming for.
In Q2, our improvements included better triggering of site links and ads and improved ad rotation system, better geographical targeting, expanded match for keyword variance and a whole host of other improvements. As an example of benefits of these changes, the advertisers taking advantages of new close variance feature and exact and phrase matching are seeing roughly a 2% increase in clicks in average.
Let’s talk about the third theme, the technology, where we are in our enterprise business. I think it’s become clear for us that we have a serious small, but growing business, which is going to be a future growth engine for Google. I hope you read this week about a company, who said competition was 50% more expensive than Google, and not as cool. That company is now $200,000 a year Google apps customer.
Companies, schools, governments worldwide are moving to the could faster than ever. More than 5 million businesses have now gone Google worldwide. The traction amongst large organizations even such as the U.S. Department of Interior, Fairfax Media in Australia, et cetera. I think it’s clear, you can’t fake a commitment to cloud computing, and we’ve invested to build and scale a business that has gone to upstart to upper crust.
Thousands of businesses switch to Google apps from our competitors everyday. Recently, we’ve launch products like Google Drive, Google Maps Coordinate, as well as the ability to edit documents off-line and in a whole range of mobile devices and tablets. That just shows you the pace of innovation that Google is bringing to the business technology.
With over 1 million active applicants of App Engine and the recent launch of Compute Engine, our Cloud Platform that makes Google’s infrastructure directly available to developers and businesses.
Let’s change the gears. Let’s talk about countries and how our performance was across the world. Across all products, growth in the Americas and Asia was steady relative to the first quarter. The U.S. and Canada remains strong. Southern Europe slowed slightly as it was hampered by a poor macro economic in overall ad industry conditions notably Spain. On the other hand, performance accelerated in non-Europe driven by the UK.
Our clients span a full range of industries that are making the web work for their business. Let's take a few examples. Take the hotel and travel sector; in France, we work with (inaudible) to revamp and improve the search investment allocation across 23 countries. In Denmark, top travel site, (inaudible) shifted some of their TV budgets to YouTube and other Google branding solutions.
We’re particularly proud about our achievements in the automotive sector from Detroit to Bavaria. This quarter's highlights included a contract with Tesla, and a (inaudible) deal with Audi to embed Google Earth in all of their cars. In Canada, we partnered with Ford around online video content and GM and Toyota is investing significantly in YouTube.
Switching gears to our agency partners, they are leading the charge in the digital era. I think we have the best relationships with agencies around the world than we’ve ever had before. And we are being able to more those relationships to real partnerships that allows them to work with their customers to make the web work for them.
I’m particularly proud of the work this quarter with our agency partner Starcom MediaVest Group to develop a global joint account planning project across 50 top accounts. We lunched a digital training curriculum, covering Google products and digital trends, and we’re able to train over 8,000 people.
(Inaudible) sectors are good examples, but our partnerships permit all the industries and across all countries. Spanish Health Insurance, Sanitas, made a major investment in search, and now that's become our most efficient channel from customer acquisition online accounting for about 25% to 30% of their new customers.
In France, Denon is working with us on a global initiative across our display and YouTube products, as well as U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturer Shire, Intel in China chose AdMeld for a cross-platform campaign on Android and iOS because of the reach that AdMeld provides them and the seamless solutions we offer.
And in Sweden, H&M is using Google+ social extensions for search addressing. Not only does it increase traffic, but it also gives them a large number of engaged followers. They’ve increased their (inaudible) in AdWords because of that by an average of 22%.
Let’s talk briefly about marketing. Marketing is a key focus for our consumer products, and speaking about Google+, our marketing team continues to do a phenomenal job supporting our investments there. That's a Plus campaign is now in the U.S., U.K., Japan, France, and Germany and is helping to connect communities in Google+. Since this quarter, we organized hangouts with diverse groups, so it advances into the NBA to the UEFA.
As I mentioned the Cannes Lions festival, I’m particularly proud not only are we providing great marketing solutions to our partners and our customers, our own marketing team received two Grand Prix awards, one for Project Re: Brief where we worked with Coca-Cola to take an old ad and make it relevant in the digital media space, and two for our U.K. voice search campaign. But not only that they brought back 25 additional awards, five golds, eight silvers, 12 bronze, our own min-Olympics. That’s our marketing team showing that innovation for everything we do.
I’ll leave you with two final examples that show the diversity of Google’s partnerships. In France, this quarter, we move forward with the commercial relationship with SNE, which effectively represents French publishers, to put out of print books into Google Play for Android. This helps user more easily access this material and enables publishers to generate additional revenue for their continent.
And second, from the sublime French literary tradition to even more sublime Doodle 4 Google contest. Our U.S. winner was Wisconsin second grader Dylan Hoffman, who in May compete a record 114,000 school children from 48 states. His school earned a $50,000 technology grand and Dylan’s Doodle grace to Google home page for a day.
I think Dylan is not listening to this call, but if he is, he’s had a pretty successful second quarter as well. So congratulations and thanks to Dylan, his family and his school from Googlers all around the world, and thanks to all the Googlers that allowed us to have such a wonderful quarter.
I’m going to handover to Susan now.
Susan Wojcicki

Thanks, Nikesh. We also had a busy and productive second quarter for all of our consumer products. Let me start with Search.
Our goal is to deliver technology that just works. Larry has described the perfect search engine as something that understands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want. We’ve made a start for a more intelligent search, thanks to the Knowledge Graph which understands real world thing, their defining characteristics and their connections to one another.
Our Knowledge Graph currently includes more than 500 million thing, people and places, more than 3.5 billion facts about them. This includes entities like landmarks, celebrities, sport team, works of art and a lot more. For a summarizing related content all at one place people not only find what they’re looking for, but they also make (inaudible).
For example, I was checking [films] this weekend, so I searched for the movie The Dark Knight Rises, from the Knowledge Graph results that’s showed up on the right hand side of my search results, I was able to find out that the movie is coming on tomorrow, some information about the film and which actors star in it. Since, I didn’t recognize all the actors, I clicked on the photos displayed and I was able to see biographical information as well as other movies they’ve been in.
The Knowledge Graph results also should need related movies that other people have searched for. I discovered a number of movies, including movies scheduled to come out later this year and next year that I also want to see.
The Knowledge Graph also works great on mobile. If you voice search for Julia Roberts movies on your phone, you will see a list of her latest films in the search results. And if you are running an Android device with Jelly Bean, our latest Android release, Google will actually say the list of movies back to you, powered by the Knowledge Graph in addition to giving you the traditional search results.
Also on Android, we introduced Google Now, a feature that intelligently brings you the right information at the right time, just for you even outward. For example, one morning last week, Google Now told me that (inaudible) 16 minutes longer than normal based on current traffic. All my schedules have been late or now gone. I didn’t have to do anything, the information just showed up as a notification. Google Now also shows me other things I may care about like weather, driving directions, my next appointment, cool places nearby, slide updates and scores for my sports.
As you can see, we’re serious about providing more intelligent results. We’re moving beyond the search engine that just matches strings of words to one that understands the people, the world where people do. Just as a knowledge graph connects real-world thing; Google+ is a social spine that is starting to connect everything across Google. With a new Google+ local feature accessible from desktop and mobile on Maps, Search and Google+, the users can find and share nearly 100 million places and local businesses like restaurants and museums.
You just can make decisions about where they want to go based on Zagat scores, summaries and reviews from friends and people they trust who are on Google+. Once they decided where to go, they can use the New Events tab in Google+ to plan their activity and to share photos and comments before, during, and after the event.
We’ve also redesigned the Google+ app for both Android and iOS, and we’re recently announced a Google+ experience for Google, for Android tablets and the iPad. More users are now accessing Google+ from mobile devices than from desktops. Today, 250 million users have upgraded to Google+ meaning, they’ve signed up for Google+ and created a profile. we’re excited about this momentum, but we know, it’s still early days that people build a community on Google+.
Moving on to shopping; this is another area where we’re helping people more quickly turn their intentions into actions. In May, we announced a new commercial model built on product listing app, it’s called Google Shopping and our transition to the new model will be complete in the fall in the U.S. By having a commercial relationship with merchants, we believe consumers will see more reliable and up-to-date information of our prices and product availability. A merchant should receive higher quality traffic to their site.
We’re also experimenting with new commercial formats on Google.com that have product summaries and larger product images. These new formats are clearly labeled sponsors and they help shoppers more easily find and compare different products, or refine their searches by brand or product type. Try searching for camping tents to see an example of these new results.
Users can find special offers and deals with Google Shopping, and can shop with confidence when they see a Google trusted store badge on retailer site.
On the platform side, we had a lot of key announcements and launches at our Google I/O developer conference. Let me give a quick summary of the highlights. We announced 1 million new Android devices are being activated each day with more than 400 million devices now activated worldwide.
We showed our Jelly Bean, our latest version of Android and the Nexus 7, a tablet that is build for Google Play. More than 20 billion apps have been downloaded from Google Play. We announced that Chrome has 310 million users worldwide, which is up from a 160 million last May.
We brought Chrome for Android out of beta and we introduced Chrome for iOS which became the most popular free app in the Apple app store within hours of its availability.
We launched our new infrastructure service product called Google Compute engine, which lets developers and businesses run Linux virtual machines on the same infrastructure that powers Google.
Google documents became editable offline and we announced Google Drive for iOS. Drive is a place to create, share and store all your content that’s available even without an internet connection, and it functions across Windows, Mac, Android, Chrome OS and now iOS.
We released 3D cityscapes in Google Earth for mobile, announced that travelers with an Android device can now access offline map of more than 150 countries. And expanded our Street View maps, our Street View feature in Google Maps to provide panoramic imagery in more than 3,000 cities, across 40 countries.
And then of course there was Sergey surprise demo of Google Glass, with a live video hangout with skydivers wearing Google Glass and jumping out of an airship nearly a mile above downtown San Francisco, and then landing on the roof of the I/O Conference Center. To see this demo for yourself, you can search on Project Glass demo on YouTube. I definitely recommend this video.
Thanks all for your time and now back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Susan. I’m never going to jump off with one of these balloon plane. So it was an absolutely unbelievable experience and thanks for Sergey’s innovation on that one. One more thing just before we turn to Q&A, just a couple of announcements, one, we have just launched our Google+ Investor Relations page, which is designed really to be a great source for Google products updates and company news relevant to investors and shareholders. So please be sure to check it out and let the IR team know what you think of it. So that’s just launched about an hour ago.
And as we are about to open the lines, I just also want to invite David Drummond, our Chief Legal Officer, he will be joining Nikesh, Susan, and myself to answer any questions that you may have. So welcome David to the call as well. And we are going to turn on now Jamie to the Q&A section. So let us know how we want to operate.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark S. Mahaney – Citigroup
Great. Thanks. Two questions please. First on Motorola, the comments at the time of the acquisition is that it would accretive, do you still feel that that asset can be in any thoughts would give us as to how you would make, what has been pretty consistently a loss leading asset that Motorola Mobile, how you make that accretive? And then a product on Search and what you find in terms of the appetite with the interest in voice search, Google has had a voice search capability for a while. But as you’ve noticed over time, people are more interested in using that less the quality of that versus whatever regular search. How interesting do you think that is as a growth area for Google in the future voice search? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So I’ll just answer the Motorola question, and then let Susan jump in on the Search. On the question of Motorola, look we’re totally excited about this opportunity that we have with Motorola, and our management team has been there only a few weeks. Clearly, everybody should expect some changes at Motorola that we have already talked about in the public domain and when we said, Dennis and the management team is there resetting and retooling it. but we have nothing really to announce right now. I think we have to let them do their work. but I can tell you that was a probable excitement in MMI for all the employees, but also for the clients.
So I just want to come back, Mark to your point on accounting. If you actually took out the accounting issues that were related to closing the transaction where it’d be just upgrade, the amortization of intangibles, and some of the adjustments that were related to the acquisition, in fact on the mobile side, they didn’t have – they had a pretty stable and good quarter, and there’s a lot of accounting noise in the data. So I think it’s going to take one or two quarters before all that noise comes out. Susan, do you want to comment on the voice search?
Susan Wojcicki
Sure. Yeah, so I mean voice search has been an area that Google has been investing in for a number of years. we believe like we have really good technology here, because we’ve invested for so long on this. and as I mentioned in my – when I talked before hand, now with the Jelly Bean release, we have the ability not only to ask a question, but also to have the answers given back to you. And so, I definitely recommend that you test it out. it is very powerful and we think in the right circumstances, users will want to – some users will want to type and some users will want to have voice. And so in the circumstances where they do, was developed a really amazing technology that is leading edge on that.
Mark S. Mahaney – Citigroup
Thank you, Susan. Thank you, Patrick.
Patrick Pichette

Thanks for you questions, let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
We will take our next question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse Securities

Thanks, I guess one question and two parts for Patrick on Motorola. You talked a little bit about some of the accounting noise, Patrick, and it doesn’t sound like it’s finalized. Yeah, but, I was wondering if you could give us a rough sense of the purchase price allocation in terms of the hard assets, versus goodwill versus other intangibles so we can sort through some of that noise.
And the second part is, I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the Motorola home business in terms of how that fits in, if you guys consider that strategic? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette

Okay, so on the details of the purchase price we haven’t given in terms of the asset and obviously the IR team can follow up with you on that, but I think in our disclosures the press release like, you will see like for example, intangibles was 30 some million in the case of Motorola and 32 I believe for Google. Just on the intangibles, so it gives you a sense of numbers for the step periods. As it relates to the home business, I mean, again a bit of the same story that I told Mark prior, which is, we’ve just got into the place and we’re in the process of evaluating every business of MMI, in every division of it. So it’s a little bit too early for us comment on big changes right now. So I just need a bit of patient for us to complete our home work as we’ve been there just for a few weeks.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse Securities
Sure, thanks a lot Patrick.
Patrick Pichette

Thanks Spencer. Let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.	
Carlos Kirjner – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions, one on mobile and one on YouTube. On mobile, have you conducted any studies on the impact of mobile adoption or search query demand by end users. And do you have a perspective on what portion of mobile queries are incremental versus cannibalistic for handsets and tablets.
And on YouTube, I think one or two quarters ago, Nikesh referred to Google Analytics as the unsung hero of the business. Thinking about YouTube brand advertisers, how do you give them visibility into brand advertising ROI in YouTube, and do you think you will be able to do that to get the dollars to flow and overcome the obvious challenges that you may have there?
Patrick Pichette

So, Nikesh would answer the second question; Susan on cannibalization of mobile versus desktop.
Susan Wojcicki
Yeah, definitely; maybe we’ve spent a lot of time looking at that to trying to understand how those two different types of devices and how those searches are interactive with each other. And this is very complicated, but I will say we believe that mobile searches are mostly incremental. For example on weekend, when you – those are out and about, you usually see a raise in mobile activity. And then when users are back on Monday, we see a raise of desktop. So, although it’s not a one-for-one, we do believe that they are mostly incremental.
Carlos Kirjner – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC	

And does it value Susan between handsets and tablets.
Susan Wojcicki
In terms of queries?
Carlos Kirjner – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC	
No, on the incremental versus cannibalistic.
Susan Wojcicki
I mean we’d look – I think we’re still in the process of trying to have run our analysis and trying to figure that out. I mean I think that the thing that handsets and tablets have in common is they’re both on the go and people are willing to take their mobile, people use tablet certainly in the office environment as well. So, I would say, we’re still doing the analysis on that.
Carlos Kirjner – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay. Yeah, so we have a clear view on the handsets and on the tablet there’s more analysis to be done; on YouTube, Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
(Inaudible) Carlos, hi, so in YouTube there are two different issues. And if you’re talking about performance advertisers, they’re able to look at ROI on YouTube versus other performance media on the online space. I guess more interesting when you start talking about brand, because brand is not just about the online space, brand is also about the television space. And we’ve done very exciting things, with single source panels, where we worked in Germany with thousands of users and try to look at advertising effectiveness and efficiency, not just on YouTube and online video, but also compared to television and we’re incorporating data into our analytics and our sales pictures to show how the ROI is available on YouTube. We’ve noticed only doing at higher ROI, but we also get higher reach and higher frequency capabilities on YouTube, because you are looking at users on a very large online platform.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question Carlos.
Carlos Kirjner – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC

Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Let’s jump to the next one please, Jamie?
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Ben Schachter – Macquarie Research Equities
And just two questions, I was wondering first, give an update us on Larry’s health situation and then I know it’s early, but can you update us on the usage of Chrome for iOS devices, and any comments you can give to help us understand the importance of that product and also how you plan to market it. And then also, historically you’ve talked about self driving cars and some of these other projects as relatively low investment, high media profile projects, but it seems with Google Glass and some others and they are taking more management time and focus, should we be thinking about those differently? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Yes, I want to let Nikesh talk about Larry situation, Susan can talk about the second question on iOS Chrome and then I’ll just take it to run, so Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
There is no more new news on Larry. Larry has lost is voice and we said that means he cannot do any public speaking engagements for the time including today’s earnings call, but he continues to run the company and he is here and involves in all the strategic business decisions that we’re making.
Patrick Pichette
Susan.
Susan Wojcicki
And on Chrome for the iOS device from the moment we launched it was a very popular in the app store and we’ve seen this one of the top apps and it’s something we’ve invested for many years on Chrome. It’s got a lot of really compelling features, from security, being very fast and we continue to expect to see growth just because of the users using it for the different features that make it a really great product.
From the other things, the self driving cars and Google+, I mean those continue to be projects that from a headcount perspective are very – are small, we’ve talked about them being they are small, but they have the potential to be very big. And I think they are also projects that – we sort of think about them as moon shops a lot of time, like projects that we think can have really amazing capabilities, but again, and they get the company excited, but in terms of actual resources, it is a very small number.
Patrick Pichette
Yeah, the fact that Sergey is actually leading the Glass project doesn’t change any of the strategy. So from that perspective just very exciting and fun to share it with people when we have such exciting demos. But I wouldn’t change any of the strategy in terms of the real focus of management and our capital intensity.
Nikesh Arora
Thanks, Ben. Let’s go to our next question please.
Operator
And we will go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley
Thanks for taking my questions. I had two please. You’ve previously referenced the Talent or in last year increased the cash compensation by 10%. I was just wondering given the transition of a number of companies that you compete with for Talent into the public markets, could you just give an updated view on the cost and availability of the Talent in the Valley? And then secondly on a last 12 months basis, Google has generated $12.5 billion in unlevered free cash, so you now have an 8% unlevered free cash yield and you are generating cash at an run rate that equates to about 30% of the current cash positions. So I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the way that you are currently thinking about capital allocation or specifically a share repurchase? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora
Okay. So let me start with the second one first. We continue, and I know that sound a bit like a broken record on this, but on a very regular basis, we actually debated with our board. In our – our cash position is really a strategic asset to us given all of the innovation that's happening, and all of the options that are available to us.
I mean it has been such, and you just take Motorola, which we just closed, I mean it was a real strategic asset to us to actually be able to pounce. So we haven't changed our position in terms of share repurchases or dividends or any of the others for a time being, which does not mean we don't evaluate. We do take a good look at it. We just think that it continuous to be a strategic asset for us, and so that's why we haven't changed our position yet.
In the case of the talent, I think that the Valley continues to be hot, I mean it's a hotbed of innovation. There's a lot of need for that talent, especially the very high, the engineering front, and we're delighted by our strategy. I mean we continue to see really benchmark levels for our retention purposes, and we continue to attract the very best talent. So for us, it is an absolute strategic asset again for the company. I mean, Googlers, the engineers that are here in the salespeople and they've really make a huge difference to the velocity of the company. So the Valley has not change, it content despite everything else is going on in the world out there are. The Valley continues to be absolutely hot, and we’re still pleased to have seen our strategy pay out so well. So thanks for your question Scott. Very good question.
Let's go to our next question please Jamie.
Operator
And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs
Hi, great, thank you. I had two questions. First, what are you seeing in terms of mobile CPC trend, and how do you see these trends playing out over the course of the next 12 months. And then, the second question is, with the Nexus 7 on the market, can you talk a little bit about your plan to accelerate content acquisition in particular in video and book? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
I think Nikesh is perfectly suited for both.

Hi, Heather. Thank you for your question. Well, I think the good news is that we’re seeing phenomenal growth in the mobile queries across the board, whether it’s tablets, whether it’s mobile phones, whether it’s geographical or whether we are seeing phenomenal amounts of mobile queries across the board. I think as I said, mobile is right now where Search was in 1999. we had a situation where Susan’s team was doing phenomenal product innovation to keep driving more and more efficiency for the advertisers. we were working with advertisers to get them to get better landing pages, better sites, get them to understand truly the opportunities on the mobile space for example. You can make phone calls, so we have a product called Click-to-Call. Now the Search takes on a whole different meaning, because there’s a better conversion and people actually click and make phone calls.
So we are seeing mobile CPCs are healthy and we expect them the long-term that they will continue to be healthy and sort of follow this trajectory that Search has followed, more inventory, more effectiveness, more ROI for the advertisers, better pricing in the market. In terms of your second question on Nexus 7, I think we have made tremendous amounts of headway in the content space that we have a lot, lot of content on Google Play. we are working very closely with the music industry, with Hollywood studios et cetera, to get more and more content on the platforms, so I think given that there are models out there where other people are offering content to the platforms. it is becoming to the standards that you can have the ability to offer content to the end user and we are making tremendous amounts of progress across the board.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question, Heather. Let’s go to our next question please.
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Doug Anmuth – JPMorgan
Great, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask two things, just first following up on the mobile CPC question, can you just give us some color on what percentage of advertisers are bidding on smartphone to N tablets in addition to the desktop? and then secondly, Patrick can you also just help us understand the accounting around the Nexus 7 tablet and how we should be thinking about that on a growth versus net basis and the impact it may have going forward? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Okay. So I will let Nikesh cover the CBC and I also come back after.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, actually I think I already said that in my prepared remarks that we have over 1 million advertisers working with us in mobile advertising and it gets over 300,000 mobile apps. So I think it’s a substantive number in terms of number of advertisers are involved in mobile space. And I think usually people will get enrolled in mobile space don’t distinguish between smartphones and tablets, they actually, they want to find the most effective ROI they can get and they want to capture as many queries as you get on these device. Patrick?
Patrick Pichette
No, the issue for the Nexus S, Nexus 7, the – I mean we have two sets of accounting, obviously, it’s distributed on it’s own by others like, you can get it at Best Buy and otherwise when you use the Play Store to actually buy it right, we book the revenue and then we book the cost as well and the cost will be in other cost of revenue rather than CAC or TAC, they’re neither of them and that’s how the accounting is set.
Susan Wojcicki
Yeah, and this is Susan, just one more thing I would add Doug on your question about the mobile CBCs and the percentage that are bidding, is a lot of campaign structures are setup so that when an advertiser participates in a bid, they actually bid, they can instead of one campaign and it can run across everything. And we adjust those prices dynamically for them, we have – it’s called Smart Pricing. And so some advertisers do bid specifically on mobile and then some advertisers have bundled campaigns and we adjust those prices. So it’s not just advertiser that are bidding only for mobile that are participating in mobile.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for your question, Doug. Let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
And we will go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Great. When you look at your international result ex-FX, they actually were stable or even accelerated. Yeah, we are hearing a lot of issues over there. Can you talk about geographic mix, what countries are doing well or vertical mix and any product enhancements or new products you’ve launched that are really helping your revenue growth there. And then secondly, TAC to distribution partners was up about $40 million quarter-over-quarter and continues to be a bigger chunk of your Google website revenues. What drove the quarter-over-quarter increase, was that mostly mobile or are there other factors? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So, let me jump on TAC, and then let Nikesh answer to the first question. So TAC, it's really a mix, right, obviously TAC reflects a mix of the different distribution methods that include toolbars, chrome distribution, mobile distribution, and also obviously the AFS business as well. So there's a – if you look at our revenue mix between Google properties and network, right network will attach stronger, so that will drive TAC as well. And then, mobile is also one of these contributing factors. So we don't break down all these specifics, but it’s not only mobile. I mean, we have a number of factors that are at play here. On the first question, I’ll let Nikesh circle back to you.
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, I alluded to some of this in the prepared remarks. I think, as I said growth in the Americas and Asia has been steady this quarter. The U.S. and Canada have stayed strong, and as I mentioned, as you’ve said there have been some issues internationally. Southern Europe, we saw slide dip as we think it is hampered both by pure macro economic conditions and all ad industry concerns. Spain was a notable sort of lowlight or highlight depending on how you look at it in that conversation. On the other hand, performance accelerated for us in northern Europe driven by the UK and the UK has been a little depressed over the last few quarters. So it is finally coming back and sort of we are seeing strength there again.
In terms of your question and on the sectors, I think travel has been strong pretty much across the board in the U.S. and the UK and around the world. Auto was strong in the U.S. for us, healthcare has been strong in the UK, and generally across the world, we've seen strong sort of performance both in finance and local, and we're seeing more and more sort of excitement and enthusiasm in sectors like CPG and entertainment given the shift to brand. But I’d say, this is the snapshot in time and these things change quarter-over-quarter.
Justin Post – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Justin. Jamie, let’s go to our next caller please.

And we’ll go next to Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.
Anthony Diclemente – Barclays Capital
Hi, thanks. One, I think for Susan, just if you can help us with the order of the magnitude the drivers of the divergence that we continue to see between CPCs and volume. I think in the past you’ve talked about, of course mobile is one of those drivers, but then FX, we have a sense of that, property mix, emerging markets and add quality changes, all driving that. So I was wondering if you guys could give us like a ordered magnitude of how important each of those key drivers were in the quarter and then how we should think about those trending going forward, if we should expect that divergence to normalize or should we actually expect it to continue to diverge? It will be helpful. Thank you very much.
Patrick Pichette

Susan, do you want to give some comments on it or Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
I think, I had the CPC (inaudible) on this quarter and you can’t have a good earnings call, if you don’t talk about CPC, so here we go. CPC is an important metric for us, but if you take that independently, it’s not necessarily a reflection of the fundamental health of our business. This quarter, I’d say the biggest impact on CPC was actually FX. We have four or five factors that impact CPC, but the biggest impact this quarter was FX. We have clearly an impact of mobile versus tablet versus desktop, we have an impact of emerging versus developed markets, and what’s happening from a macro economic point of view, that we’ve talked about, we have an impact on google.com versus network, so as you see the network playing a bigger role, it impacts CPC. And finally as quality changes, also impact CPC, but I’d say this quarter the impact has been felt because of FX, but from a positive perspective we see any time there was a change in CPC, which is more attractive for the advertiser that allows the advertiser get a bit of ROI, but for us it’s an opportunity for the advertising.
Patrick Pichette
Yeah, it’s important to know that the 16%, there was a big chunk of it, that was CPC versus the last quarter. I mean, as the euro kind of went down 9% year-over-year, I mean it obviously makes a big difference. So thanks for your question.
Anthony Diclemente – Barclays Capital
Okay, and that’s a nice one. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Cheers. Let’s go to the next question please, Jamie.

And we’ll take our next question from Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.
Ken Sena – Evercore Partners
Hi, thank you. Can you just maybe talk a little bit more about the Offers business and do you feel strongly about that business as you did in the past. And maybe how that business actually will come into play with Google+ or on payments or (inaudible)? Thank you.
Susan Wojcicki

Hi, Ken. So yeah Offers continues to be an area that we are investing in, we have, I mean we think that there is a lot of things that are really important about Offers the way it’s a local business and works with both small and large business it’s got, there is a lot of user interest in it. So it is an area that we are continuing to invest in. We’re also, as we continue to develop our business model continues to evolve. And for example, we are putting a little – we’re working with a lot of the different Offers and providing distribution for them in addition to generating our own Offers with our own sales team. So, but it continues to be an important area for us, and we’ll continue to invest in the cities that we’re currently operating in.
Ken Sena – Evercore Partners
Thank you.

And we will take our next question from Ronald Josey with ThinkEquity.
Ronald Josey – ThinkEquity LLC
Great, thanks for taking my question. Going back to mobile and the opportunity there, Nikesh I thought that might be interesting if you could talk a little bit about, perhaps what you are seeing in terms of the campaigns and there has been an acceleration, now that AdMob is fully integrated in AdWord, knowing that there is over a million advertisers and 300,000 apps. I’m wondering if there is been accelerations since that's happened? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora
Hi, thanks for the question. I think as I said, we are seeing phenomenal amount of growth in the mobile query space and it’s a consequence of more device, it’s a consequence of more adoption of tablets around the world. It's also comfortable with the devices and using them more often. So with the number of questions they asked on the AdMobs. so AdMobs just got completed in early June. So it’s a bit early to say, we're seeing acceleration. but generally, our performance throughout that integration has been very strong and we’ve effectively had a very, and what we’ve done about six months ago, as we took all of our sales efforts and we took our specialized mobile sales people, we had them trained all of our sales forces around the world. So that impact has even contributed more than just that integration part. but we think the integration is just going to turbocharge that effort and hopefully continue to help us drive mobile. and mobile is going to be here for a while. I think it’s a fact of life for us now. So we are mobile sort of becoming as core, as desktop search was, so we’re making sure that all of our sales people around the world are fully equipped and working with every advertiser, not just 1 million to make sure that people can see ROI in both mobile and desktop simultaneously.
Ronald Josey – ThinkEquity LLC

And we'll go next to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
Jason Maynard – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Hey, good afternoon. I have one question just on the shifted mobile and specifically around this will be both Nexus as well as Motorola. How important do you think it is for ultimate mobile modernization to actually control the whole experience on the device and given that you’ve got all sorts of different competitors some who subsidize evidently, some obviously telling full price, hardware, software combos, what do you think the right mixes for Google and when do you think you’ll sort of sort this out and be a little bit more declarative in the market with your intentions? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora
I think, hi this is Nikesh again Jason. thanks again for your question. And as I said, mobile is very, very important. I think it’s better to go back and think about what’s happening in the marketplace. We said we’re very committed to mobile; it’s evident in our commitment to Android in our ecosystem as well as Motorola acquisition.
So we believe that mobile us very and very important critical to the future. Now, I know it seems a little complicated when you look at the different competitors, and how you talked about subsidies et cetera. We simplify that by focusing on, how do we provide the best experience to the user. Now providing the best experience to user, is effectively working really hard with Andy Rubin, Stephen Android making sure he is getting the best experience for the end-user and in that process he works with the best OEMs in the marketplace to make sure that the combination of hardware and software allows for the best experience to be delivered. I think, for us what's important as to get that experience delivered and we will work with whatever the industry models that are out there, either we work direct with operators, trying to make sure that happens behind the end-user and more often they’ll not be work with OEMs, to see how we can get the best agreed experience in the hands of the end-user. I think that's what we're going to focus on. So, I think that's quite declarative in terms of intention.
Patrick Pichette
Yeah. I mean just to close, open is really important to Google and in that context you see our strategy is very focused on end-users and been open and we are going to get a lot of benefit that we already have and continue to get a lot of benefit out of that. So, it's a complex question, there is no doubt about it. Thank you, so much for your question. Let’s go for the next question please.
Operator
Now we’ll take our next question from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.
Lloyd Walmsley – Deutsche Bank Securities
Thanks, I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the rollout of the shift to paid inclusion for Google shopping and when you expect it to be fully rolled out and kind of what you're seeing today in terms of Paid Clicks and CPCs, now that some of the shopping links have been moved to high end results and where do you think CPCs there can go relative to just core paid search?
Patrick Pichette

I’ll let Susan answer this one. Susan?
Susan Wojcicki

Yeah, so Lloyd, so we made this decision to move to a commercial model because we saw that ultimately this would drive a better experience for users and having more up to date information and more accurate price and inventory availability and so we are in the process of rolling that out. We think it will be rolled out. We expect probably completed around the Q4 timeframe. And we are working really hard with all the merchants to get them all on board, and again we think this is actually really good for both the merchants and the users.
We actually don’t refer to this as feed inclusion, just because that actually is a term from the people who have been in the industry for a really long time meaning putting in, paid things into the search results, in a non-marked way. And we’re very, very clear when we show this, we do mark everything very clearly as sponsored, and again we believe that actually moving to this model is good for both the users and for the merchants and we’re really looking forward to this transition.
Lloyd Walmsley – Deutsche Bank Securities
Thank you.

We will take our next question from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company.
Kevin Kopelman – Cowen & Co. LLC

Hi, thanks. Could you give us a sense of how big your mobile search queries are, as a percentage of total search queries? And also on Motorola, I know you’re not giving us a business update, but could you give us what the Android unit growth was in the quarter on a pro forma basis? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette

Well, on the last one, on the mobile side, the non-home side, it’s all Android. And on the search queries, we don’t actually provide the details. We provide the geographics, but we don’t give the details of the other one. So, I am sorry Kevin if we can’t be more helpful on the granular details on this issue.
Let’s see, we have time for one more question, let’s jump on one last question, Jamie?
Operator
Thank you, sir. We’ll take our last question from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.
Jason Helfstein – Oppenheimer & Co.
Thanks for taking my question. I’ll ask you just two. One, can you just talk about the growth of Google+ number growth, are you happy? I think you alluded to how that's going. What can you do to drive faster member growth and is that kind of part of the strategy or you just led it organically evolve. So kind of a push versus, I guess the pull strategy there. And then second, can you give us the breakdown of depreciation between Motorola and MII for the quarter? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette

Well, you’ll have, in the segmented reporting you'll find that information. So, after the call, so this is for your second question, Jason. On the issue of depreciation, I think that the team can circle back which would give you the split, because we do the segmented reporting. On the first question, which is about Google growth and our success there, I’ll let Susan cover that one.
Susan Wojcicki

Sure. Yeah, so, overall we've been really pleased with the growth that we've seen, you’ve talked about the $250 million accounts that we have, Google+ accounts. And I do think it's also really important to remember that Google+ just celebrated its one-year anniversary. We actually celebrated that at IO. And so, we see that Google+ account growth has growing really well. We think that one of the most important things is that when you have a Google+ account you have the ability to share. And we've talked about Google+ being the social spine across all of our products ability to make all of our products better. Not just the stream, which is an important part, but also for example your search experience. So that if I have a friend, a friend went to hotel, and +1 that hotel, if I’m ongoing to that same location, I would you be able to see that information at the time that I'm doing that search. And so we have many, many use cases where we think being part of Google+ will be a better experience. And so we’re working across the board to make sure that our products are integrated, we have a number of integrations across the products, probably local with the most significant one that we did this quarter, and we find that having those integrations by making the products better, also tried to more usage of Google+. So yeah, so thank you Jason, that was an important question.
Jason Helfstein – Oppenheimer & Co.
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
And with that with an eye on the clock, we’ve got to run. I just wanted to do couple of things; one is thank Nikesh and Susan as well as David for joining us for the call, and Q&A. I also thank all our Googlers, I mean these last 90 days and the great results that we are posting now and beginning of the collaboration and integration of Motorola, all these things are possible because our Googlers do a phenomenal jobs every single day.
So I want to thank everybody and then as I close, remember to go and take a look at our Google+ website for investor relations. And I think you will find it pretty interesting. So with that Jamie, I’ll let you close the call, and I wish everybody a happy summer.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google Inc. First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Jane Penner. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Jane Penner
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; David Drummond, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, and Chief Legal Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.
Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call.
This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours.
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Page
Thank you. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. It's great to be here with all of you. I'll talk about our new class of stock at the end of my remarks, but first, I want to focus on our performance. We had a very strong quarter with revenue up 24% year-on-year at $10.6 billion. Since becoming CEO again last April, I've pushed hard to increase our velocity, improve our execution and focus on the big bets that will make a difference in the world. Google is a large company now, but we'll achieve more and do it faster if we approach life with the passion and the soul of a startup. This has involved a lot of cleanups. We've given many of our products including Search a visual refresh. They now have a more consistent look and feel. When we've closed or combined over 30 products, we have so many opportunities that without hard choices we end up spreading ourselves too thin and don't have the impact that we strive for.
Creating a simpler and more intuitive user experience across Google has been another important focus. I have always believed that technologies should do the hard work, but just takes scheduling and communications, so users can get on with what makes them happiest, life. Our products work seamlessly together so people don't have to navigate Google to get stuff done.
Chrome for Android, which launched this quarter, is a great example of this kind of simplicity we're shooting for. It does mean switching between devices painless. All of your tabs are there across your desktop and Android, you can even click the back button on a different device and it just works. Just try it out, it's a great experience.
It's the same with Google Play, which we also shipped this quarter. You can now access all your movies, your books and apps and games from the web or from your Android device, no cables, downloading or syncing required. We spent years working with partners to get all of this great content. So it's really exciting to see it brought together in a beautifully simply way that people can enjoy.
Now Google+ is truly at the heart of our efforts to create a simpler, more intuitive experience for all of our users. You should think of it in 2 parts. One is just our social spine. Once you're logged in and have upgraded to Google+, you're just using one Google, not a series of disconnected products. It's still early days, but with over 120 Google integrations to date -- Google+ integrations to date, we're on the right track. And your user experience on Google just gets better. You can see friends' recommendations when you're using Google Play and you don't think about that as Google+, but it just comes from that infrastructure. And we're seeing a positive impact all across the web. Google users can now recommend search results they like, a goal we’ve had ever since we started the company.
The other part is the social destination, which is accessed on your mobile client or on plus.google.com. This social destination part grew from a base of 0, not starting with all Google users like the part I was previously talking about, and is growing quickly. In fact, we see impressive engagement in fast growth here. It's just not all of Google. We are starting up a new community.
We're excited about the amazing speed with which some people have amassed over 1 million followers, and I have just been lucky enough to pass 2 million. I get high-quality feedback on the public post I make, which I really enjoy. And every day we make Google+ better. Just yesterday, we took another big step forward with a beautiful new UI for Google+. And the new customizable navigation driven in that redesign makes it much easier to access your favorite apps. There's better discoverability for Hangouts and you'll love the larger images that you see across that interface.
Now last time, there's a bit of confusion over the metrics I gave about Google+. I want to be clear about these 2 parts of Google+ and the fact that we have made great progress on both parts. As you would expect, the social spine is proportional to Google and all of the usage across Google. And Google’s pretty big. And well over 170 million people have now upgraded to Google+.
So to summarize, there are 2 parts to the Google+ experience: the part that is the social spine, and the other part that's the social destination part of Google+ exclusively. Both of these are growing fast, but the social destination part of Google+ is growing as a new product with very healthy growth.
I'm also excited by our big bets. We have some amazing new products that were seen as crazy when we launched them, but now have phenomenal usage. They can easily pass the toothbrush test. They're important enough that millions of people use them at least once or twice a day. Chrome has over 200 million users. Our Display business has reached an annualized run rate of over $5 billion and 850,000 Android devices are activated every day. And YouTube just keeps on growing. These are just staggering even by Google standard. They had over 800 million monthly users uploading over an hour of video per second. I'm incredibly proud of these achievements. They wouldn't have been possible without an amazing team of Googlers and the long-term focus with which we are able to run the company, which brings me to this afternoon's announcement about our stock.
Now throughout our evolution from being privately held startup to a large publicly listed company, we have managed Google for the long term and enjoying tremendous success as a result, especially since our IPO in 2004. The founders, Sergey and I, really hoped but we did not expect that Google would have such significant impact. And that this progress has made us even more impatient to do important things that matter in the world. Our enduring love for Google comes from a strong desire to create technology products that enrich millions of people's lives in deep and meaningful ways. To fulfill these dreams, we need to ensure that Google remains a successful growing business that can generate significant returns for everyone involved.
When we went public in 2004, we established some clear well-publicized expectations for investors around our governance. We wrote a couple of things in our original founder’s letter, I just want to read here. ""New investors will fully share in Google's long-term economic future, but will have little ability to influence its strategic decisions through their voting rights. And we are creating a new corporate structure that is designed for stability over the long-time horizons. By investing in Google, you're placing an unusual long-term bet on a team, especially Sergey and me.""
I wanted to quote all that because these are the clear well-publicized expectations we established for investors. And while this decision was controversial at the time, we believe with hindsight it was absolutely the right thing to do. Eight years later, these still -- statements are still remarkably accurate and everyone involved has realized tremendous benefits.
Given Google's success, it's unsurprising this type of dual-class governance structure is now somewhat standard among newer technology companies. In our experience, success is more likely if you concentrate on the long term. Technology products often require significant investment over many years to fulfill their potential. For example, it took 3 years just to ship our first Android handset and then another 3 years on top of that before the operating system truly reach critical mass. These kind of investments are not for the fainthearted.
Long-term product investments like Chrome and YouTube, which now enjoy phenomenal usage, were made with a significant degree of independence. However, day-to-day dilution from routine equity-based employee compensation and other possible dilutions, such as stock-based acquisitions, will likely undermine this dual-class structure and our aspirations for Google over the very long term. We have put our hearts into Google and hope to do so for many years to come, so we want to ensure that our corporate structure can sustain these efforts and our desire to improve the world.
Today, we announced plans to create a new class of nonvoting capital stock. These shares will be distributed via stock dividend to all existing stockholders. The owner of each existing share will receive one new share of the nonvoting stock, giving investors twice the number of shares they had before. Effectively, a 2-for-1 stock split, something many of our investors have long asked us for. These nonvoting shares will be available for corporate uses like equity-based employee compensation that might otherwise dilute our governance structure.
In November 2009, Sergey and I published plans to sell a modest percentage of our overall stock ending in 2015. We are currently halfway through those plans and we don't expect any changes to that, certainly not as the result of this new potential class. We both remain very much committed to Google for the long term. It's important to bear in mind that this proposal will only have an effect on governance over the very long term. In fact, there's no particular urgency to make these changes now. We don't have an unusually big acquisition planned, in case you are wondering.
Investors and others have always taken a big bet on Sergey and me, and that bet will likely last longer as a result of these changes. We are honored that so many of you have put your trust in us and recognize the tremendous responsibility that rests on our shoulders. We think this is a good thing because users rely on Google to produce and operate amazing technology products and to safely and responsibly store their data. That is our passion.
Thank you very much, and I will now hand over to David to explain some of the more technical aspects of this proposal.
David C. Drummond
Thanks, Larry. So first of all, I wanted to say that we'll be filing a proxy statement soon, which will have more details about today's proposal. But for now, I want to give a few broad strokes.
First off, as Larry said, what we announced today is basically a 2-for-1 stock split, and here's how it works. What we're doing is creating a new class of stock, Class C. That new stock will have equivalent rights to our existing Class A and Class B stock, except it will have no voting rights, and it will also be issued through a stock dividend on all Class A and Class B shares. So after the dividend, a stockholder who currently owns one share of Class A common stock with a single vote will continue to own that share plus one share of Class C capital stock that does not have a vote. Our existing Class A shares will continue to trade as they do now and the new class C shares will also be listed, so stockholders will be able to trade those shares, the class C, just as they can with the Class A shares today.
Now one thing to emphasize, because all stockholders will be treated equally and will receive one share of Class C for every share they now hold, everyone, including Larry, Sergey and Eric, will retain the same voting interest they had immediately prior to the dividend. And it's also important to note that as part of this, Larry, Sergey and Eric have all agreed to subject their shares to a transfer restriction agreement. This agreement maintains the same link between their voting and economic interest that exist today.
So if any of Larry, Sergey or Eric sell or transfer their nonvoting Class C shares, there's a stapling provision in the agreement that requires them to either sell an equal number of Class B shares or convert an equal number of Class B shares into Class A shares. Now the stapling requirement will end when their ownership levels fall below certain thresholds. So the basic thing to understand here is that the stapling provision is designed so that subject to these thresholds, the votes held by the founders and Eric will be reduced proportionally as their economic interest in the company declines.
Now a word about the process we used. Our Board of Directors carefully considered this proposal to create a new class of stock before reaching a decision. The process the board followed was robust and the deliberations were extensive. Back in January 2011, the board established a special committee comprised of independent non-management board members to consider this new class of stock or other alternatives. The committee met on numerous occasions over the 15 months that the special committee considered the proposal and that, that was separately from the board. The committee recommended and the board unanimously approved today's proposal.
In terms of next steps, the proposal’s subject to the approval of a majority of the voting power of Google's common stock and they'll vote together as a class that will happen at our Annual Meeting on June 21 of this year. Given that Larry, Sergey and Eric control the majority of voting power and support the proposal, we expect it to pass. Following that, the board will set a record date for the dividend to move the process forward.
So for more detail on the proposal, you can find the Founder's Letter that Larry and Sergey issued this morning as well as a postscript from me on our Investor Relations site. And as I said, next week, we'll file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC, so you'll have even more details about today's proposal.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick to talk about the quarter.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Well, closing this first year with Larry leading Google as CEO, all of us at Google feel a renewed sense of velocity, focus and optimism in our Q1 operating, but also financial results are a good reflection of this spirit.
So let's jump right into the financials. Our gross revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $10.6 billion, 1% quarter-over-quarter, and our Google websites also grew. Revenue grew 24% to $7.3 billion, with strength across most major geographies and verticals. Google's Network revenue was up 20% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, 1% quarter-over-quarter. And Network revenue was still negatively impacted by the search quality changes we began to make a year ago in late February, otherwise known as Panda. Other revenue was up 56% year-over-year to $420 million and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate paid-click growth was very strong, just shy of 40%, up 39% year-over-year, and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate cost-per-click growth was down 12% and down 6% quarter-over-quarter.
So given the recent trends in CPCs and clicks, allow me to spend a bit of time today addressing this. The most important thing for you to understand is that our business is healthy. We believe that shifts in CPC and paid clicks taken independently really do not reflect the fundamental health of our business. Now allow me some details on this. In general, we attribute these trends to a combination of really 5 core factors. Those include FX, and then there's 3 mix effects. For example, the mobile versus tablet versus desktop shifts, emerging markets versus developed markets shifts and even the basics of google.com versus our network. And then finally, ads quality changes which is also a huge factor. So as you can see, it's a complex set of dynamics with multiple variables at play.
Many in the financial community have tried to isolate or often I hear pick one of these among these factors as the primary driver for CPC or click trends. Some even say it's about -- all about mobile. Others suggest that it indicates weakness in demand for Google advertising. Well, on the latter point, I want to be very clear that that's not the case. One important signal we have for advertiser demand is bidding behavior. And in fact, our advertisers’ bid continue to be very strong and are growing.
So the dynamics around CPCs and paid clicks are just simply very complex because of all of these big factors and change continually. So trying to pick a horse, so to speak, just doesn't make sense. We internally track all these factors with the help of a number of statisticians, economists and engineers who dig into all these details on an ongoing basis. So we won't go into that level of detail every quarter, but again, the key thing to understand is that we believe that shifts in CPC, or paid clicks taken independently, simply don't reflect the fundamental health of our business, which we believe is actually very healthy. If anything, the recent lower CPCs present a great opportunity for advertisers to get an even better return on their ad spend. And lower cost, better ROI attract advertisers and thus, this is good for Google for the long term as well. So enough said on CPCs and paid clicks.
Let's just turn to geographic performance. The U.S., U.K. and rest of world are growing still at good pace as reflected in our results. In our earnings slides, which you'll find on our Investor Relation website, you see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world that showed the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
Our revenue in the U.S. was up 22% year-over-year to $4.9 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 54% of our total revenue or $5.8 billion, up 26% year-over-year, which includes modest $37 million benefits from our hedging program. The U.K. was up 19% year-over-year to $1.2 billion.
Let me now turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition costs were $2.5 billion or 24.5% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.2 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $74 million. And finally, operating expenses excluding SBC again, totaled $3 billion. SBC totaled $482 million for the quarter, and the increase year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and promotional spend and professional services.
So as a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit was $3.9 billion for Q1, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin slightly above 37%. These robust margins give us the confidence to continue to fully fund the strategic growth areas such as mobile, Android, YouTube, Chrome, all the areas that Larry talked about. And Nikesh will go into more details of these initiatives in a minute.
Turning to headcount, which was approximately 610 for the quarter, and we ended up the quarter with roughly 33,077 employees, full time. Our effective tax rate was lower this quarter, 18%, and this reflects the mix of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries and hedges and also some capital gains offset by carried over capital losses.
So now let me turn to cash, cash management. Other OI&Es or other income and expenses was $156 million for the quarter, positive, and it reflects a higher realized gain on our investments, offset somewhat by lower interest income and by the impact of our FAS 133 expenses from our hedging program. For more details on OI&E, once again, I refer you to the slides that accompany us on our IR website.
Operating cash flow was very strong, $3.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $607 million versus last quarter at $951 million. The majority of our CapEx spend was related to production equipment this quarter, as well as data center operations and facilities. And as a reminder, we will continue to make significant CapEx investments, and these have shown to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, mostly depending on when we're able to make these investments. So in total, very pleased with our free cash flow, $3.1 billion.
Let me close with my usual reminder that our revenues typically exhibit seasonality in the first half of the year, while our expenses do less so. So it's just a forewarning for everybody who's kind of tuning their models.
I'll hand off now to Nikesh who will cover in more detail our business performance in the quarter. Additionally, since Susan, who is typically on the call, is on a well-deserved spring break with her family this week, Nikesh will also cover some of the product highlights, primarily in Ads.
With this, I'll turn it over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. I will now give you an update on our business activities. As Larry and Patrick have mentioned, we had another quarter of excellent performance, resulting in $10.6 billion of revenue this quarter. Our results are actually reflective of 3 major trends that are happening in the online advertising space, so let me just touch upon those.
First, we're seeing a big move to solutions. Our clients and partners more and more want complete solutions that work across all screens: desktop; mobile, tablet; and in the future, television. And also work with all kinds of formats, whether they're search, display or video ads. It's like having individual solutions for different devices and formats. So we're driving our teams to sell solutions across the entire marketing funnel. From building brand awareness to conversions, we are converging our teams of over 8,000 people to setting these complete solutions in 60 countries, making us one of the largest online solutions player.
Secondly, the big trend is we're seeing a breakthrough on brands. More than at any point in the last decade of online advertising, we're at a point where major brand advertisers, from movie studios to CPG companies, are finally looking to digital media as a central part of their marketing efforts. We are making huge progress. YouTube has gone from an interesting ad buy to key buy for brands. In May, we'll be hosting our first upfront for brands and agencies, showcasing the latest channel content and opportunities for marketers, something television has been doing forever. We will do that for YouTube in New York.
And third, we're beginning to see a trend on cross-media measurement. Social advertising has always been highly measurable, and we have been leading the industry in extending the measurability, not only in Search, but in Display, Mobile and live video. We are actually taking that one step further and trying to move that measurability into offline sales. Our experience is that businesses may allocate experimental budgets to new areas, but they invest serious money only when they can measure the results. We are rolling our best-of-breed measurement technologies so all clients can measure their ROI, whether their goals are online conversions, brand lifts or just the ability to compare offline and online media.
Let's talk about some specific product areas. Search, our Desktop Search business has maintained robust growth with strong traction with our top partners around the world even in the face of economic uncertainties that we've been noticing in Europe. I think search advertising has broken through that sound barrier of being an online channel, which now finally proven to drive in-store sales. For example, we partnered with IKEA in Italy in a study showing that each click on a paid search ad generates $7.60 of revenue. And then interaction with paid search in conjunction with television drives 20% of contribution to sales. And there's a lot of room to improve on that, but it's a cut clear demonstration of how online advertising is no longer just restricted to online sales but also having a huge impact in the offline world.
Last week, we launched a range of features to improve location targeting so that marketers can reach users by zip code or have their physical location show up more prominently in their ads.
In sales, I want to highlight Google Analytics, which is an unsung hero. Over 10 million marketers and websites globally use Google Analytics to measure the effectiveness of their online presence in real time. From large e-commerce sites to small blogs, that means that our technology is at the heart of over 10 million businesses, helping them get the most out of the Web.
Last quarter, we made several important improvements to Google Analytics, helping marketeers to measure the impact of the traffic from across over 400 social networks. I didn't even know there are 400 social networks.
Let's talk about Display. On Display, we saw a robust revenue growth as our clients continue to see the value of integrated advertising solution in driving business results. For example, we signed a deal with Unilever in Brazil for a campaign that ran across all Google properties, including YouTube, Search, Google Display Network and Gmail. We also recently partnered with leading sportswear company, Reebok, to develop a global display campaign across YouTube, Mobile -- YouTube and AdMob -- and mobiles, YouTube as well.
On the platform side in Display, we continue to make progress. We are now the leading platform provider for agencies and publishers to help drive their business using display advertising. We are focused in building unified buying and selling platform that helps them manage their advertising across all media much better than they have been able to in the past.
Our good relationships with our clients are helped by rapid product development and innovation. Last quarter, we launched the Google Display Network app in AdWords, which makes it easy for all AdWords clients to build, monitor and find display campaigns across millions of sites in our network. This is helping bring the world of search and display even closer.
Let's take a minute to talk about YouTube. As I mentioned, YouTube is an amazing success story. It's gone from an interesting buy to an obvious buy. Our watch paid sales have accelerated, particularly in key emerging countries, but also in mature ones. Today, most of our in-stream ads in YouTube are skippable, while our TrueView ad format, which is fast becoming an online video standard. It's great for users and it's great for advertisers. For example, the U.K. mobile operator O2 is actively now using YouTube to support their brand launch. They're using several YouTube products, including TrueView YouTube Mobile. They even live stream the New York -- sorry, the New Year Eve's concert from the O2 arena in London globally in YouTube.
In addition to this, we're also rolling out our 100 new original channels in YouTube, featuring top talents like Jay-Z, Madonna, Tony Hawk, as well as innovative new media companies and YouTube's new own successful partners. We think YouTube is fast becoming the platform for the next generation of talents, which is great because we're also seeing initial success selling the sponsorship for these channels to large advertisers such as Toyota, Unilever, GM as all in anticipation of the big upfront event coming up in May.
Let's change gears and talk about mobile. Mobile is quickly becoming a backbone of many clients overall advertising strategies and has huge headroom to grow. We continue to innovate with our product offerings with a number of new tools for advertisers. One development we're particularly excited about is our new enhanced click-to-download formats. This format in Search helps marketeers and developers promote apps. These things help improve ROI to provide users with more relevant download information about apps such as star rankings, pricing, et cetera, and all this happens right in the ad creator [ph]. So we keep actively working to help develop the mobile ecosystem from enabling mobile commerce to empowering local businesses.
In Q1, we began to scale our GoMo campaign, which is our Go Mobile campaign. This initiative helps businesses get more and more assertive and set up great mobile websites so they can keep driving traffic to those websites and expand their businesses. We've done these efforts across the world in North and South America, in Europe, in Asia and Africa.
Moving beyond advertising. Our Enterprise business also saw excellent progress as large organizations and small businesses continue to see the value of Google Apps as a cost-effective and feature-rich productivity suite. Some of our top customers to go Google in Q1 include global pharmaceutical company Roche, more than 90,000 users; the State of Colorado, which announced they intend to move 26,000 employees and users to Google; also the University of Pennsylvania and Rome have gone Google. Not only that, small business adoption of Google Apps is on fire, with SMB signups almost doubling in the past 6 months. So we're happy with the business and we're happy with the way Enterprise continues to progress.
Let me go back and show some more color on the country performance, as Patrick also talked about. From a regional perspective, we saw generally stable performance in the Americas. We saw a sustained traction in most parts of Europe and we saw acceleration in Asia, all this was driven by strong performance from our long tail Sense sales channel. Growth in North America was steady and this certainly was boosted by seasonal events such as Super Bowl, Valentine's Day, tax season. Canada was a little slower. Of course, Western Europe was robust in spite of the macroeconomic conditions. We continued seeing good growth in the U.K. Germany, France and Italy grew slightly less quickly than before. We saw strong acceleration in Asia. Japan grew faster this quarter, led by successes again, in our small and medium client base.
Let's talk about marketing and our partnerships business. Our marketing and partnership teams continue to support the fantastic growth we've seen this quarter across all of our business lines, products and services. We continue to roll out initiatives to support of Google+, which Larry talked about. We rolled out our That's the plus campaign with spots airing during the Grammys, the Oscars. Google+ and Hangouts are getting great traction. We have President Obama, we have Governor Romney, they both conducted very successful Hangouts in the platform. Even NASCAR held a Hangout ahead of the Daytona 500. But the most interesting was Seaview Survey, it had underwater Hangout live from the Great Barrier Reef. It's amazing to be able to see our great products like Hangouts be so successful. I recommend that all of you try Hangout soon.
As Larry mentioned, we also launched Google Play, which provides users one place to find, enjoy and share apps, music, movies and books instantly anywhere across the Web and on the Android devices. To support the launch, we are on a 7 days to Play promotion, offering discounts and apps and media, and our YouTube video has received over 3 million viewers to date. Our partnership teams also kept its great work, supporting our products by being very close to our partners. For example, we launched Google Street View in Russia, which lets users walk around the historical centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg. And we are also thrilled that this quarter our Google Cultural Institute help bring Nelson Mandela's archives online. We expand our successful art project to include new museums from the Getty Museum in L.A. to the museums in Paris and Qatar. Project now provides access to more than 30,000 ultra-high resolution images, paintings, sculptures and photographs in 151 museums and other institutions in 40 countries.
So in closing, I think Q1 was an excellent quarter. It has led us off to a very good start for 2012. We look forward to continuing to serve our users, customers and partners for the rest of 2012 and beyond. Also, I want to say thank you to all the Googlers and our global business team, all of our partners in the product and engineering teams that allow us to make these wonderful things happen and allow us to continue to drive the business.
With that, thank you, and I'm going to hand you back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. So Jamie, our operator, is going to give us the instructions to get to the Q&A. So Jamie, why don't we just jump right in?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Two quick questions. First for Patrick. You mentioned the headcount growth was only about 600 this quarter. That's obviously slower than what you saw in 2011. Should we -- is this roughly the pace we should expect for 2012 or were there perhaps some timing factors? And then secondly for Larry, you talked about Google+ unifying the Google product. So when you think about things like Google Wallet and Offers, the mobile strategy maps, do you think of these as individual products or are they part of perhaps a broader local strategy? And if so, how do they fit together?
Patrick Pichette
Perhaps why don't I just jump on the technical question, then let Larry get to the second one. So look, I think that the headcount fluctuations, you'll remember last year when Larry said that we were at what was the kind of the edge of what was tolerable. And look, this short-term variability is actually the very best proof point that we don't manage kind of quarter-to-quarter and try to smooth things out. It just happens that in the first quarter, at this time of year, it's a bit different than when you come back in Q3 when you have all of the graduate students that actually start with us, so there's a bit of fluctuations there. So I wouldn't read that much into the numbers, but we're basically continuing to push on plan for hiring for this year.
Larry Page
And the question, I guess, about our products. I think we're working very hard, and I've talked a lot about this to make our Google experience be more unified and feel like one great experience for people. And many of the products you mentioned, Google Wallet, Offers, Maps, I mean, they apply kind of across many of the things we do. And so I think you'll see better integration of those products over -- through the rest of our products has already exist with Wallet, for example, across many different parts like Google Play and so on. And I think you'll see that increasingly happen over time just as we make these experiences better. They'll come up when you expect them to come up and when they make sense for users. I think that's definitely a big area of focus for us.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Two quick questions. First, in terms of appealing to major brands, and Nikesh I think you talked about how you're seeing major brands engage more with YouTube and other assets. Could you talk about how you're trying to go after those dollars? Are there new things that you're doing now that you weren't doing 2 years ago to kind of accelerate that momentum? And then just real quickly on the mobile CPC issue. Can you just comment again on over time, over what period of time you would expect mobile and desktop CPCs to merge or do you think that's a realistic expectation? What would cause that to happen or not?
Nikesh Arora
Let me take the first question quickly, then I'll give you a little color on the second one, then Patrick can jump in. In terms of what we're doing differently, as I mentioned, YouTube has gone from being an interesting place where brands to be to being a must-buy. So we're seeing tremendous demand for inventory, which is brand related. And for the most part, the online world in the past has been more performance related i.e., people wanted to get some transactions, they wanted to get more people to their website. Now they're seeing the benefit of using the Web for brand affiliation and for brand recognition. So we are beginning to have a different sales pitch with the large brands, which is oriented towards them coming and getting their brands seen a little bit, and YouTube is a phenomenal tool in that regard, which acts sort of like an anchor property. Then we're able to package our demographic base inventory around the Google Display Network, around YouTube and actually get the brands to engage in the large campaigns, which can run the millions of dollars. This was a capability we couldn't have a few years ago because the inventory didn't exist or the demographic tools didn't exist. So clearly, this is a new space and a new sort of pitch to our brand advertisers. As I said, we are trying to light this up across our sales force around the world in 60 countries.
Patrick Pichette
No, we just have -- let's go through the mobile CPC question. So Mark, I think that this one is -- think of it as so much upside for us because essentially mobile is exploding in query growth and the formats themselves are just adapting already a lot and from a relatively crude base to so much more in the future. So that you're absolutely right that right now they don't monetize as well because we're kind of in what search used to be in 2002, 2003, 2004. So as these formats kind of continue to get better and better, we'd expect much better performance on them.
Larry Page
This is Larry. I'll add something, Mark. I think the mobile CPCs -- I mean, people always spend their most effort on the major -- whatever the major source of traffic or revenue is, and those are growing really quickly, albeit currently, obviously, there's more on desktop. I think over time as a reverse, and I think that the ability to kind of on your mobile to do local kinds of transactions, to really easily communicate with people and to do the kind of capabilities you have on your mobile device. And the fact that you spend most of your money locally, I think that over time that may actually reverse and the CPCs action may get better. But I think we're very bullish about that. We're making a lot of investments in that area, in things like Offers and so on and Wallet. And we're very, very excited about the potential there, and also Click-to-Call and other things that we do. So I think, for example, it's a lot easier to call someone from your mobile than it is from your computer right now. And so if that's how you're relying for transactions, actually mobile CPC should be higher for that. So I think you just haven't seen the focus on it and we're moving more and more focused on to that, both on our sales side and our customers are moving focus onto that, but I'm very, very bullish on that.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research
Larry, in your 2012 update letter, you speak of all these notions of changing the world and ambitious goals on risky projects and having a healthy disregard for the impossible. Without getting into too much detail, at a high level, what types of projects is Google working on that would really surprise us? And are you remaining committed to the 70/20/10 rule where these noncore areas might get only 10% of the investment? And then separately, just on the google.com TAC, please, that continues to increase as a percentage of Google revenue. Is most of that coming from payments to mobile partners? And given the growth of mobile, should we expect that to continue to increase meaningfully?
Patrick Pichette
Do you mind, Larry, why don't I answer the last one first because it's really easy and then you can jump on the rest. Look, on TAC, if you look at our percentages -- as a percentage of revenue year-over-year, I mean it's basically stable. I mean, it moves a little bit here and there and you have partner mix and FX mix between mobile and others, but it's not actually changing in any dramatic way. So what you have to see in there is just the regular mix of both traffics and partners that come in and out all the time as well, so that I wouldn't read too much into that. I'll let Larry answer the real sexy question.
Larry Page
I think I didn't mention specifically the 70/20/10 in my letter. I should have, that's a good addition. So we definitely still see a -- most of our resources should be going to our core businesses, which really Search and Ads and a few of those things I mentioned that's really fallen to that core, I think. And then there's 20% kind of near things and maybe another 10% on the really speculative things. Through our whole history, we've really struggled this and have 10% kind of on the speculative things. Generally, it's much lower than that. I think the real thing that's needed on those projects is some management. Those take up bandwidth. You saw our announcements of Google Glass last week, which I was very excited to go out. You've seen the driver with his car kinds of things. And it does our take our executive time to deal with those things and so on, and so I think that's the real investment we make rather than being huge amounts of dollars on those kinds of things generally. We've got a limited number of things we can do. As I've been saying, we've been trying to focus. So trying to make sure that we have the right speculative bets as well as the right bets we're making on our core products and so on. And I'm pretty excited about our ability to do that. And I think it's hard coming from the outside because I mentioned in the letter I published today that Android took 3 years, plus 3 years kind of to really get to where it is today. That's 6 years, and you all haven't seen android, right, for those 6 years. We've seen it for those 6 years and we really invested in it. It's not so much money at the earlier stages, but attention. And that's an important, I think, discipline for the company to have.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Similar to detail on cost-per-click, would you discuss the key drivers of higher paid-click growth? Is it quality changes, Product Listing Ads or something else? And more broadly, maybe you can discuss how Product Listing Ads do impact results as we're tracking a substantially higher number of these ads on your site?
Patrick Pichette
Without giving -- look, the short answer is yes, and that's what the core answer of my message to the market was today. I think that you have a combination of international factors. You have a combination of new formats. Ad formats drive a lot in terms of paid clicks. If you think of even the sitelinks' extensions that we've -- like we have a new generation of sitelinks for this quarter, right? This is a perfect example of a product where by adding additional lines that are more targeted, so instead of having just kind of, trucks or -- and then you go down into the second layer, right, you have less CPC for that additional sitelinks. But if it's a better ad, people click a ton more on them. So it is really all of those 5 factors that actually drive them. And that's why we're continuing to kind of be pretty happy with the health of the net effect, which is real growth. Certainly, internationally, I mean it also -- you can see our mix between international and non-international. And that's driving it as well. So you have all these factors at play. And we're pretty happy with what we're doing there.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Two things. First, just want to follow up on the question on mobile and TAC. If you could help us understand beyond CPCs how the economics of mobile are different and perhaps a little bit more detail on how you're paying OEMs and carriers. And then secondly, any updated thoughts on the cash balance and an update perhaps on the split of U.S. and international cash?
Patrick Pichette
Let me start with the last one first. We don't give the breakdown of our U.S. cash. We do it kind of irregularly, so we haven't done so of late. We have -- we continue to have a very strong cash balance, both U.S. and international. You'll notice, if you go into the details of our cash balance and on our balance sheet, right, we have just slightly under $2 billion of sec lending programs. So when you really, really look at our net cash balance, you got to take that sec lending out because it's on both sides of the balance sheet. But for the rest of it, incredibly healthy cash balance, both domestic and international. And Nikesh, do you want to give a quick update on the mobile CPCs and their mix?
Nikesh Arora
Yes. I mean, again, I'm not going to talk about specific of the TAC on mobile. But as you know, we get people using our devices both organically as well as through our distribution partnerships with carriers and OEMs. And typically, the OEMs and carriers participate in some of the economics that are on the Android marketplace or Google Play and some of them participate in the economics around Google Search just the way we would do syndication on the Web platform, which you do with many partners around the world. We have similar deals on the mobile front. I think in the mix, it comes out. This sort of washes out and it sort of adds up into our number which we show in -- our total number of green desktop and mobile. But mobile is no different from the way the desktop business operates out there.
Patrick Pichette
And we benefit from the terrific growth.
Operator
And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Two questions, if I may. If you think of the future of Internet search 3 or 4 years out, how important will the social signal be and how important your personalization be? In other words, would the company with the best social signal be able to offer the best search? And if the answer to that question is no, why is Google investing so much in Google+? And second question, if I may, you probably end the year with about $50 billion in cash and marketable securities and that will give you quite a lot of strategic flexibility. Given that, what's the rationale to continue to increase that amount on market on cash to shareholders?
Larry Page
I'll take the first part, Carlos. I think the -- this is Larry, and I think it's a very good question. And I think one of the things actually had in my remarks when I took out was to talk a little bit about Search and just enough time to put it all in. And I actually covered the question you're asking. I think one of the most amazing things I think we can do today that we couldn't do even a few months ago is to really -- I have this friend Ben Smith, right, who's a person at Google. He has kind of a common name. Now when I do a search actually, it finds the right person and it puts him in the search box. So for the first time, the search box isn't really doing searching a string, just the sequence of letters. It's actually searching for that person that I know. Now it's not, obviously not all the searches you do, but being able to search for people well is important. And knowing -- having real feedback from users about what they like and don't like and things they're sharing and so on is very useful for search. And we have a lot of those signals already, but we can always use more signals. We can always use better relevance and we can always use more data to generate that. So I think it is very important. I think it's not -- think social data about identity and ability to easily share things with other people and comment on them and things like that is a basic utility for people in all of our products. And that's where I was talking about Google+ really working across all of Google for identity and sharing and notification and other things that it does really well. So that all applies to Search and I think it's important for Search. I think search is going to change a lot. We're going to make it a lot better over the next 5 or 10 years as it's changed a lot in the past. And it will include a bunch of those signals and a bunch of other things as well.
Patrick Pichette
Carlos, why don't I take the next one, the issue of our cash balance. We have a healthy cash balance, I had mentioned a minute ago, and we still believe  that it's an incredible strategic asset for us. You saw it last year when we decided to make the purchase of MMI, and we continue to monitor this cash balance. And for the time being, we really believe that, that strategic asset has a ton of value. So we'll continue to monitor it and we have a process by which we actually review it on a regular basis with the board, and those questions are always asked. So we have a good governance process around it. But for now and the time being, we have nothing to announce on it.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I was wondering, Larry, if you could walk us through your view on Google's tablet strategy via Android and the relative importance of having success with these devices in terms of achieving your long-term goal?
Larry Page
Heather, that's a good question. I think that we're very excited about tablets. I think there's a number of Android tablets out there and obviously, we have strong competition there as well. I think you've seen us really invest substantially also in things like Google Play, which really give you great access to entertainment, media, books and videos and so on, and as well as the apps. And we think that's an important component of what we're doing. I think there's also -- obviously, there's been a lot of success on some lower-priced tablets that run Android, maybe not the full Google version of Android. But we definitely believe that there's going to be a lot of success at the lower end of the market as well with lower-priced products that will be very significant. And it's definitely an area we think is important and we're quite focused on.
Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I have one for Larry and one for Patrick. Larry, Android is obviously a key focus. You talk about it a lot in your letters. Can you help us understand the strategic value for Google since you're not licensing it? Do you see more revenue per device if it runs on Android or lower TAC or what else can you tell us about what the real advantage to Google's advertising businesses? And then Patrick, obviously, higher in CapEx in Q1 this year, a lot lower than Q1 last year. Can you tell us if you factor in your revenue growth when you make that spending decision, your outlook? Does that -- give us any clues on your outlook for revenue growth over the next couple of years?
Patrick Pichette
Why don't I jump on the -- because mine again is not a very strategic one, it's more how we proceed. Look, it's lumpy because there's just timing decisions, right. We would -- there's probably a few areas where we would have like to actually make investments in Q1 and for a bunch of logistics reasons or otherwise, we couldn't. And so -- and you'll notice that's why there's kind of like $350 million difference between Q4 and Q1. And you should just expect it to be lumpy and that's just the nature of -- data centers are kind of big and clunky. And when you buy some piece of real estate, it's big and clunky. So there is quite a bit of variability into it. But we're -- again, I wouldn't take any one data point to start making a trend out of. So it's tough for, but I think that you can see we're committed to capital. If you look at the last couple of years, we've really made kind of significant investments and we'll continue to do them because it's a real strategic asset to us as well. So I'll let Larry answer the first question.
Larry Page
Justin, I think on your questions about Android, I think they're pretty short-term focus and I think it's good to think about the longer-term issues. We don't get very many new operating systems, kind of only a few in my lifetime, and I think they're pretty important. And I think Android's really about increasing the pace of innovation, usage of mobile devices and our ability to get a great user experiences out to our users, which I think we're doing a great job of. I mentioned over 850,000 devices per day are going out. And it's important to remember we're very early stages of that like we've only -- I'm amazed the computer that I'm carrying in my pocket is as good as the one I had a few years ago on my desktop. And I think we're only at the very, very early stages of what's possible with those devices. And I'm excited about a whole bunch of things we're doing in that area. We already mentioned kind of things like I said I'm very bullish about CPCs will improve on mobile over desktop due to all those capabilities. And so I think the benefits we get from Android are a lot. I mean, obviously, we have great integration with our products and Search and Google+ and photo uploading and there's a hundred things that we do really well on Android that benefit us across the board and across our users across the board and our products across the board. And I think that's going to continue to be the case. And I think it does lead to better economics for us too because we're providing amazing experiences for people that are well integrated and work well and they demand. So that's -- I'm very positive on all those things.
Operator
And we'll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Larry, just wondering as you look out on a very long term kind of 5-year view, do you see tablets taking perhaps the majority of home Internet usage? And if so, how strategically imperative is it for Android to have a big success in the tablet space given partner TAC could impose a high cost to the extent Android doesn't have a hit?
Larry Page
Yes, I mean, I think I've sort of already answered this question previously about tablets. I think the -- I mean, like I said, I think it's an important area. I think your computing experience, obviously, if you have an Android phone or use Google a lot online or you care about all those things in terms of your experience. And so I think you're thinking about your user experience. You're thinking about across all the devices use. I think people are going to get a lot more devices. We see kind of a convergence between all the services on those devices. And right now, I feel like each device you got is kind of a hassle the deal with and you're thinking about each individual device and all the issues with it. And I think that's not really right. I think you're going to have a pretty unified experience and a great experience from a user point of view and you won't have to manage all these devices. So I think you want to think about all these screens around you working seamlessly and working well for you. And I think, obviously, tablets are important. We have Google TV obviously. Big screens are important, computers are important, phones are important. Everything, all those devices are important. And I expect that they'll work well together. So I think that's kind of how we would think about it, and I think it's -- I don't think any single device there is going to drive all the usage or all the kind of convergence that needs to happen.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
I had a question for Nikesh. Can you give us an update on the growth rate you're seeing today in your core Search business by small, medium and large advertiser tranches? I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that Japan had strong growth, primarily due to smaller advertiser tranche. So how does that growth look in the various advertisers' size buckets across your GOs? And then is the speed of small advertiser adoption increasing right now versus prior periods given all the new local products that you have?
Nikesh Arora
Yes, I mean, I think the one way to think about it is that fundamentally we have one auction, and that auction every advertiser participates, whether it's the small advertiser or large advertiser. So they way we think about it is that we try and go ahead and get more and more advertisers to see the benefit of online advertising and the solutions that we offer. So as more and more advertisers come into the auction, it drives the price up of the auction for both large and small advertisers. And the way to think about it is that there's a price as we talked about CPCs and paid clicks, but it's really the third variable that goes into it, how many advertisers can we bring into the auction and how many various things can we get them interested in, whether it's mobile, whether it's YouTube, whether it's Display, whether it's Search. So there has been a lot of effort we have put in from our end, both to get more small business online. We've been adding GXBO campaigns around the world where we get small businesses online. We've also been cleaning up our signup flows for our adverts products, which is a self-served product where really small business can sign up. We have been working on getting people to have more mobile sites and getting people out in the mobile campaign. So effectively, it's a lot of effort towards getting more and more advertisers into the ecosystem. And as that happens around the world, you will see seasonal patterns or some sort of spikes when we work harder on small businesses in one quarter in certain parts of the world. But eventually, it all benefits the auction and we see the trend over time ends up working the same way for large and small advertisers.
Operator
That final question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.
Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Just one question for Nikesh or whomever wants to answer it. It seems like even though as you're shifting to mobile, you have this presumably double-digit pricing step down for CPCs. But in the Display world, certainly, that pricing difference could be even more dramatic. In some cases, by half or 2/3. Prices getting cut on that shift to mobile. And so you guys at Google have the unique ability to compare and contrast the difference in price between like Search and Display and how the 2 are monetizing relative to desktop. And so any color on that comparison would be appreciated because I think there are folks out there that have a view that actually Search, core Search, monetizes better on that shift to mobile than Display does, and I would love to just understand that better.
Nikesh Arora
Yes, I mean, I guess -- let me try to just explain to it from the advertiser perspective. So what we're striving towards is advertisers are interested in ROI. Advertisers actually are not interested in whether they're on the mobile product, the Display product, the Search product on the Web or the Search product on mobile. So what we are fast converging towards is we're basically sitting down and understanding ROI targets of our advertisers. And then we have immense amounts of inventory at our behest, whether it's mobile inventory, on Display or Search or desktop inventory or even inventory to our network. And what we are trying to work towards is being able to dynamically allocate across these various products, what allows them to get the maximum ROI. In that case, they are sort of -- they don't really care about whether they got that transaction to happen off one platform, one format or the other. So that's what we want to aspire, and that works really well in performance advertising because there is a specific objective the advertiser has. On Display, on brand, it works slightly differently, obviously, because you're talking about CPMs. But generally, that's the way to think about it. In the long term, we think mobile will monetize better. And we usually don't see the difference happening on Display and Search as you alluded to. Larry, you want to add something?
Larry Page
I'm just going to close the call here, and I really thank everyone for spending so much time with us today. And thank you all for spending time with us today and for being so interested in Google. And now, I'll turn it over to the operator.

Also, as you know, we now distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany this call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours.

Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Page
Good afternoon, everyone, and happy new year. Welcome to our first earnings call of 2012. Great to have all of you here. 
I'm very happy with our results. Google had a very strong quarter with revenues up 25% year-on-year, 9% quarter-on-quarter, and we blew past the $10 billion mark for the first time. Pretty exciting. 
Looking back on 2011, I am most excited by the fact that we significantly improved our velocity and execution, my priority when I became CEO in April. With Google+, we shipped on average a new feature every day since we launched in June. That's more than 200 updates in total. And those things include a bunch of new Hangout features. In fact, David Beckham just did a great Hangout with his fans here this morning. We launched circles in Gmail and + Pages for businesses and many, many other things. 
I'm also pleased to announce that there are over 90 million Google+ users, well over double what I announced just a quarter ago on our earnings call. Engagement on + is also growing tremendously. I have some amazing data to share there for the first time. + users are very engaged with our products. Over 60% of them engage daily and over 80% weekly. 
As I said last quarter, Google+ is much more than the individual features themselves. It's also about building a meaningful relationship with users so that we can dramatically improve the services we offer. Understanding who people are, what they care about and the other people that matter to them is crucial if we are to give users what they need, when they need it. 
Take last week's Search announcement, which I'm really excited about. We've now included personal results in Search. So you can easily find information like photos and + posts that are super relevant to you, as well as the people you care about or are interested in. You can even restrict all personal results or easily view Google in the world mode just as you would have before. I really like it, and I encourage all of you to try it out, too. 
Each of improved execution and velocity is focus. There are so many opportunities for Google today. But to make a real impact in the world, we need to make hard choices about where to focus our efforts. 
Since we last spoke, we've announced that we're closing 12 of our products, including Buzz, Knol and Friend Connect, integrating a whole bunch of others into features of existing products. This means that we can double down on the really big bets we had made like Android, Chrome, Gmail, Display and YouTube. And I'm pleased to say this big bets are really paying off. We're seeing extraordinary velocity, the kind of velocity we only we can dream about. Android is, quite simply, mind-boggling. 700,000 phones are lit up every day. And I'm pleased to announce 250 million Android devices in total, up 50 million since our last announcement just in November. In just 2 days over the holiday weekend, 3.7 million Androids were activated. And today, we're announcing over 11 billion downloads from Android markets. Wow. Ice Cream Sandwich, which is the new Android release in October, is by far our best build yet. And our exciting new phones. I simply love my Galaxy Nexus. Superfast, it's great for photos, has an amazing 720p screen. 
Chrome is on fire, too. It's a wonderful example of kind of beautifully simple, intuitive experience that really improves users' lives. People thought we were crazy. Who wants another browser? It turns out a lot of people wanted to get to web quickly and securely, and we've got an amazing, fast-growing fan base all around the world. 
From the start, Gmail had security, accessibility. Get all your emails from anywhere on any device. An insane storage. That made it a winner with consumers, businesses and education. From an internal beta project 8 years ago, I'm proud to tell you today that Google Gmail now has more than 350 million active users, and it's growing rapidly. That [indiscernible] said, our merging high-use project -- products can generate huge new businesses for Google in the long run, just like Search, and we have a ton of experience monetizing those old [ph] products over time. Take Display. We brought the science of search to the art of the Display, creating a business that our latest figures show has now reached an annualized run rate of over $5 billion. 
I have some exciting new numbers also for the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, spending is up over 130% year-on-year, and the number of buyers and sellers have both more than doubled over the same period.  I'm very pleased with the advertising on YouTube. TrueView gives users much more choice over what they watch, and advertisers only pay when someone watches their ad. 
It's not just in advertising that we're doing well. Enterprise is doing great with over 5,000 new customers signing up every day. In fact, last week, we signed our biggest ever deal, about 110,000 users at BBDA, one of the world's leading banks. All of our experience says that well-run technology businesses with tremendous consumer research, make a lot of money over the long term. 
Now all of this is made possible by the exceptional people that work here. I've always believed that you attract the best talent by working on things that matter in the world and creating a great workplace environment. People want to feel part of the family even when they're at work. So I'm super pleased that Google topped Fortune 2012's Best Company to Work For list, which was published today. We've taken the #1 spot 3 times now, more than any other company. I want to thank everyone at Google for all their hard work that has made this possible. 
Let me finish up by saying that 2012 promises to be a fantastic year. We're still at the very, very early stages of what technology can do. By building a meaningful relationship with users, we can start to offer  them, just what they need, exactly when they want it. Everyone here at Google is super excited about our work today and what the future holds. It's great to be here. Thank you for taking the time to join us today, and I'll now hand over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you very much, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us again. Like Larry, I'm also very happy with our results. Google had a strong, a really strong quarter, in fact, with revenues up 25% year-over-year, crowning a year of disciplined investment, strong growth and actually great operational and financial performance. 
Let me go through these financial results, then I'll turn it over to Nikesh and Susan for more commentary on our operating performance. So let's jump right in. 
Our gross revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $10.6 billion, 9% quarter-over-quarter growth. By the way, it's worth noting that although currency rates had an immaterial impact year-over-year, they, in fact, had a negative impact on revenue quarter-over-quarter. In fact, if we applied last quarter's exchange rates to our Q4 revenue, these would have been roughly $240 million higher. So FX is a key component here. Google website revenue was up, in fact just shy of 30% year-over-year to $7.3 billion and 8% quarter-over-quarter with strength across most major geographies and verticals. Our Google Network revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $2.9 billion and 11% quarter-over-quarter. It's important to note here that the Network revenue was again negatively impacted by the search quality improvements we made early last year, and also that the momentum in our Display business continues, something that Susan will talk about in a few minutes. Our other revenue was up 50% year-over-year to $410 million and 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our global aggregate paid click growth was very strong, up 34% year-over-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost of click growth was down 8% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Remember, too, that this is an aggregate number, which includes both google.com and our AdSense properties. On this, it's important to look at CPCs and clicks together. There are numbers of factors that affect each, again something that Susan will address in the next few minutes. 
If we turn to our geographic performance, the U.S., U.K. and rest of worlds all were growing at strong pace, reflecting in our result. In our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor website -- Relations website, you'll see we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. 
Revenue from the U.S. was up 22% year-over-year to $5 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue, or $5.6 billion, up 28% year-over-year, which includes a modest $25 million benefit from our hedgings program. The U.K. was up 21% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. 
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $2.5 billion or 24.1% of total advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $1.2 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $77 million. And finally, operating expenses, which excludes stock-based compensation, totaled $2.9 billion. Our stock-based compensation totaled $459 million, and the increase year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and promotional spend and legal and professional services. As a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 38.2%, a strong margin performance that gives us the confidence to continue to fully fund our strategic growth areas in Search, Display, Mobile and apps. 
If we turn to headcount, it was up approximately 1,100 for the quarter, and we ended the year roughly at 32,500 full-time employees. Our effective tax rate was 22% in Q4, and this reflects the mix of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries, but also an impairment charge for Clearwire, which is not [ph] deductible for tax purposes. 
Let me now turn to cash management. In other income and expenses, our line was minus 18, which is a large negative variance, in fact over $300 million quarter-over-quarter. This reflects a couple of things. First is the impact of our significant FAS 133 expense from hedging program, which accelerated the expense of our portfolio this quarter now that this portfolio is much deeper in the money. In addition, as I mentioned, we took an impairment charge for Clearwire. And so for more details on our OI&E, which changed quite a bit this quarter, again please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. 
Our operating cash flow was very strong at $3.9 billion, just shy of $4 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $951 million versus last quarter at $680 million, and remember that the majority of our CapEx spend was related to facilities and production equipment. And as a reminder, I wish to continue to make -- we'll continue to make significant CapEx investments, and these have shown to be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on when we're able to make these investments. In consequence, we're very pleased with our free cash flow, which was $3 billion. 
So in summary, with such a strong performance, we continue to be optimistic about investing in our growth agenda. Let me now hand it off to Nikesh, who'll cover more of the details of our sales performance for the quarter. Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. I will now provide an update on our business activities. We've had an excellent quarter, good growth over the holiday season. Robust [indiscernible] growth on Black Friday and Cyber Monday has led to strong performance across our product portfolio and $10.6 billion in revenue this quarter. Let me talk first about how our sales team have driven the introduction of innovative ad products that delivered impressive results for our advertising customers and outline performance by region. And finally, a few highlights from our marketing and partnerships teams. 
First in Search. Our core desktop Search maintained robust growth as we continue to help our customers grow their businesses. Beyond our robust core growth supporting online sales, we're increasingly helping our advertisers to use Search for branding, as well as something interesting, which is driving in-store sales for them. For instance, by using the power of data insights, we collaborated Carrefour in France to analyze over 2 years' worth of data demonstrate how 1 euro invested in online ads helps deliver almost EUR 8 of in-store sales. We expect to promote these kinds of programs further in the coming quarters. Additionally, we saw similar success in the study with SFR mobile, France's second largest mobile carrier, where we demonstrated a 20% marketing ROI for off-line sales resulting from online advertising. So our Search business continues to be strong. 
Let's move on to Display. As Larry mentioned, we're continuing to see great revenue growth. Our investments have really paid off in the last few years. Display has now reached an annualized run rate of over $5 billion as we engage with multiple advertisers and get tremendous support from our agency partners. What is particularly satisfying is how we're able to drive this growth as a consequence as of our continued investment in innovation with products like Ad Exchange and new ad formats like TrueView. I'm sure Susan will talk a lot more about these. All these are resulting in more efficiency and in revenue for both of us and our publisher partners. On the sales side, we have continued to align our teams, now the combined Display and Search sales, to help meet the needs of our advertising partners. We continue to activate the Display ecosystem of agencies, advertisers and other publishers. Advertisers like Ford, GM, Electronic Arts, L'Oreal and their agencies continue to see the efficiency of online branding and move more and more of their marketing spend towards our products, to Google Display Network and YouTube. For example, at L'Oreal, we demonstrated that online advertising is far more efficient than television as our new formats in YouTube, which include TrueView in-stream, in-slate and in-search have provided significant reach for their branding campaigns with millions of impressions, great click-through and efficiency gains. 
Let's move to Mobile. We had another record quarter for mobile advertising as mobile search continues to surge across all platforms. The number of our clients who are using mobile within their campaigns continues to grow rapidly. For example, Mali [ph] Hotels of Spain with 350 hotels in 35 countries, they use mobile search campaigns to support their mobile e-commerce activities. As a result, Mali [ph] has experienced a 60% increase in visitors for mobile devices, and their mobile-driven bookings have multiplied by 12 in 2011. 
We also worked hard to develop the Mobile ecosystem. This quarter, we kicked out -- kicked off the go mobile campaign in the city of Mobile, Alabama, where we helped hundreds of customers build their mobile sites for free, starting a program that will inspire, educate and empower businesses to continue to go mobile. 
Let's move to Enterprise. As Larry mentioned, we are seeing great traction in our Enterprise business, both with large partners, who tend to be early adopters and future looking, and in many small businesses who see Google Apps as a comprehensive and quick solution. We now have more than 5,000 customers signing up to Google Apps every day. As Larry mentioned, BBDA was the first major bank to go Google with Apps. Costco, one of the world's largest retailers, has also gone Google. In addition, in Q4, we signed government deals with the states of Maryland, Utah and 5 top universities, including Berkeley, Harvard and Michigan. 
Let's move quickly to country performance. From a regional perspective, we continue to see strong performance in the Americas. However, generally, country growth rates are flat or softened slightly partly due to comparisons with a very strong Q4 in 2010. North America saw slight decreases from preceding quarters. Year-to-year growth rates, however, [indiscernible] remained robust boosted by a strong holiday season. In particular, Cyber Monday led the way as the biggest day of the quarter. Western Europe was broadly stable as the U.K., France and Italy held steady, while Spain accelerated slightly for the third quarter in a row. However, revenue growth in Germany slowed this quarter. Our key emerging countries continued to see rapid growth across all of our product areas. 
Let me switch gears to marketing and partnerships. Our marketing and partnerships programs continue to provide strong foundations for the growth of our business. You may have seen many of our initiatives on Google+ this quarter, in addition to the Hangout with David Beckham Larry mentioned. Our sales teams have helped our customers create over 1 million Google+ pages, as Larry pointed out, including Global brands such as Toyota, Zaphos and The New York Times. Additionally, we continued the momentum of our Get Your Business Online program. In 2011, this program has helped bring hundreds of thousands of businesses online across the world. And we got 100,000 businesses to come online in 20 countries in Q4 alone. Last quarter, we expanded internationally to India, Sweden and Malaysia, as well as domestically to additional states like Michigan and New York. 
Our partnership team continues to drive great results with our partners. We renewed 35 of our direct search partner deals, and our long-standing Search distributor deal with Mozilla was renewed as well. These and other efforts helped our syndicated Search revenues accelerate in Q4 as we saw the full impact of large deals and fast growth of 3 partners. 
In closing, Q4 was a great quarter for us, finishing a strong 2011. We're excited to continue serving our customers, partners and users in 2012. And before I hand over to Susan, I want to give a shout-out to our business teams around the world and our partners in product and engineering for these great results. I will now turn over to Susan, who will discuss product performance this quarter. Thank you.
Susan D. Wojcicki
Thanks, Nikesh. Larry mentioned last week's launch of Search, plus Your World. And I'd like to start by talking about that a bit more. 
Google Search has always been about finding the best results among billions of web pages. And until now, those results have been limited to the public world of the Internet. What we added last week was the ability to search your own world, including Google+ post photos and profiles relevant to you, all from the same search box. 
Let me give you a few examples of how this transformed my searches. Last week, I searched on CES, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, to find out more details about the show. In addition to the public results, my search magically included pictures my friends and colleagues had taken while at the show, as well as products they thought were interesting to share. In addition to seeing all the standard news for CES, I was able to get a much more personalized view of the show. This weekend, I also searched on Yosemite since I was thinking about our summer plans. In my results, I was able to see pictures my friends had taken while in Yosemite and posts about interesting things to do there. There was even an article from my mom that she had shared with my family circle, warning us not to get too close to the waterfalls. 
Turning now to ads. We continue to improve ads quality, and we launched about 20 improvements this quarter. Patrick mentioned that paid click growth was very strong this quarter and that CPC has declined. It's important to look at clicks and CPC metrics together since more clicks can often lead to decreases in average CPC and vice versa. When we make ads quality or format changes, CPC and paid clicks may be impacted differently. For example, when we introduced sitelinks, we saw an increase in clicks. But the additional clicks were on lower-CPC ads, which reduced the average CPC. Many of the ads quality changes in Q3 increased paid clicks at lower CPCs, and they were revenue positive with good user and good advertiser metrics. These ad quality changes from Q3 had a cumulative effect on Q4 metrics. Another important and key driver of the change in CPC growth was foreign exchange. And lastly, there are mix effects with Mobile and emerging markets. 
Moving on to new ad formats. These new formats now appear on about 30% of queries that show ads. Product Listing Ads, which include prices and pictures of products, saw a lot of success over the holiday season. Traffic to consumer sites from Product Listing Ads was up over 600% year-on-year. This quarter, we expanded Product Listing Ads so they can show up to 5 products, which was great for holiday shopping. We are also working to make it more efficient for advertisers to use AdWords. Many businesses have a large and dynamic catalog of products, and it can be time consuming for them to select the keywords and the CPCs for each product. So this quarter, we beta-launched Dynamic Search Ads, which generates the ads automatically based on what's on a customer website. This enables businesses to advertise a lot more of their products, and our system can also monitor the advertiser's available inventory and show ads only for what is in stock. For small local businesses, we ramped up AdWords Express. This product lets businesses get up and running with a campaign in just a few minutes. Customer sign-ups have more than tripled in the past 6 months. We now offer AdWords Express in the U.S., U.K., Germany and France, and we are trialing it in several other countries. 
In Display, which now has reached a $5 billion annualized run rate, as Larry mentioned, we're creating a comprehensive solution to buy and sell display ads across many types of digital media, such as desktop, video and mobile. One key driver of growth has been our success in audience buying. This technology enables marketers to deliver ads to specific audiences across the web, such as in-market hybrid car buyers or adventure travelers. Many audience buyers purchase via the Ad Exchange, which now has customers in 26 countries and is growing very rapidly. We also expanded to video and mobile inventory on the Ad Exchange. And on the Google Display Network, we're also growing audience buying. From Q3 to Q4, the number of active advertisers using interest category marketing increased over 60%. And that was from an already large base. By understanding users' interests, we've been able to serve much more relevant and useful ads to our users. 
Our success in Display has also been driven by brand advertisers, with video formats being an important factor. Our TrueView in-stream ads give users the option to skip the ads. This means that users who see the ads are more likely to be interested in those products, and advertisers are incented to create compelling ads. View rates range between 15% and 45%, and the people who choose to watch those ads are highly engaged. Over 60% of our in-stream ads are now skippable. It's an increase of over 4x since the beginning of the year. We now serve TrueView video ads across the Google Display Network and on YouTube Mobile. 
I'd also like to give a quick update on Offers, which has been bringing online users to off-line stores and services. Offers are now live in over 30 cities, and we're starting to feature national offers from partners like REI, JetBlue and Toys ""R"" Us. We expanded our collection of deals to include offers from partners so that users get a wider variety and partners get access to a broader user base. 
And lastly, among the many launches that we did in the quarter, I'd like to highlight one project we did called Memories for the Future. This site compares before and after Street View photographs of the areas affected by last year's tsunami in Japan. We drove thousands of miles so that future generations can see what happened. Thanks all for your time. Now back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Susan. So what we'll do is we'll turn it over to Jamie to set up the Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Maybe you could just give us a sense for mobile usage. Did you see a major shift in the mobile usage among the consumer during the holiday? And then I've got a quick follow-up.
Larry Page
This is Larry. Let me give that question to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Look, we're seeing mobile usage grow with leap -- by leaps and bounds. It's happening by a proliferation of Android devices around the world. It's happening by a proliferation of tablets around the world. It's happening generally by people getting more and more active on their mobile devices as they discover the utility and the various apps that allow them to be able to go find things, whether they're local searches, they're product searches or they're searches for generic things on Google. So yes, we are seeing tremendous mobile usage, and we saw -- seem to be an uptick during the holiday season where people were looking for products and searching for e-commerce-related activities during the holiday season.
Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
So just as a follow-up to that, so do you think that the reason for the significant decline in the CPC is -- the down 8%, is a function of the clicks going through mobile more so? Or is it more some of the other factors that you explained to us? Because I'm just trying to get a sense for the down 8% CPC number was, I guess, significantly different than what we were expecting. And I understand the trade-off with the clicks, but is mobile largely responsible for that?
Nikesh Arora
I'm going to pass that question on to my friend Susan here who's going to talk about the CPC.
Susan D. Wojcicki
So there are definitely multiple factors whenever we look at these metrics because these metrics are aggregate. But I would say the 2 biggest factors this quarter were FX as well as the changes that we had made, their ad quality or format changes, which increased the paid clicks and again were revenue positive, advertiser positive, user positive. But those clicks, as I explained, may be lower CPC like in the example that I gave in my script with sitelinks. So those were the 2 factors. But again, it's always important to remember there are many factors that contributed to these aggregate numbers.
Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Great. Just a quick housekeeping. Patrick, can you just qualify what's in that $5 billion Display run rate? Is that comparable to the $2.5 billion you provided before?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, it is exactly the same definition. So you take out all the text ads, and then you look at both mobile and desktop. So you go back to the same definition.
Operator
And we'll go next to Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Two quick questions. I guess first for Nikesh. It looks like international, excluding the U.K. revenue price load, the most kind of sequentially. I was wondering if the macro economy played at all a role? And if so, any sense of magnitude there? And then secondly, for Susan, with respect to the $5 billion Display run rate number, there's obviously a lot of stuff that goes in there between YouTube and Mobile and the ad network. I was wondering if you could just give us some maybe color of what the blended TAC rate would be for that $5 billion.
Patrick Pichette
So I'll take both questions, if you don't mind. So first, we will not -- we don't provide the TAC rate on the blended. And you're right that, I mean, if you think of the big properties that are in there, right, so you will have the GDN, we'll have YouTube, right, we’ll have all of the additional elements of our Display business, which includes the Teracents and then all of the other optimizers but also the AdMob on mobile. So that's the kind of key elements of it. But we do not -- we don't kind of comment on the details of the blended TAC on them. On the economy, look, we had actually quite a solid Q4 performance, and we're really pleased of our revenue growth. I mean, even despite the FX issues -- so you have to separate the FX issues from the economics fundamentals of our business. And performance in Europe was actually quite healthy despite the environment that we got there. And that's driven by the secular shifts of off-line to online continues, and the secular shifts of more mobile continues. So from that perspective, right, obviously, we don't control the economy, we don't control exchange rates, but we're actually quite pleased with the performance that we've had internationally in addition to the U.K. and the U.S.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I just wanted to ask about YouTube. I know that in that Display bucket. Could you quantify it at all? Is the growth you're seeing out of YouTube similar to what you're seeing in the overall Display bucket? And specifically, are you seeing a sign that TV ad budgets specifically are migrating online into assets like YouTube? When you ask advertisers who are spending more money in YouTube, where those dollars are coming from? Where are they coming from?
Patrick Pichette
So let's do a 1-2 punch quickly. YouTube is doing absolutely terrific. And on the advertising side, Nikesh will probably be the better answer to give the details. Or Larry, whichever of the 2.
Larry Page
Yes, I’d say on  the advertising side, I think we're tremendously excited about our growth on YouTube. And the amount of success we're having in advertising there is very significant. But it's not significant compared to the overall kind of video advertising space. It's a tiny percentage of that. We have a huge amount to grow. But I don't think the advertisers are thinking about it as being a significant percentage of their other spend on video. So we don't really see that.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research
On Android, the numbers are obviously very, very strong. But can you talk about the monetization potential that’s beyond Search? What has to happen with Android for you to actually make money on this? And how are you going to do it? And then secondly, the revenue growth did decelerate more than I think most people expected. And you had such strong tailwinds with Mobile and Display. Do you think that some of the deceleration came from people going to information directly through apps or going directly through vertical search like going to Amazon directly for commerce or Expedia directly for travel?
Larry Page
Yes, I mean, Ben, maybe I'll take the first on there on Android. I think we are in a very -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we're in the early stages of monetization for a number of our new products, and Android is one of those. I think we do make money from Search on apps. We do make -- we mentioned that we have a very strong advertising business on mobile, which we obviously -- a lot of those people are on Android as well. And I think that you also see we announced 11 billion downloads on Android markets. Obviously, a lot of those are free, but we also are having a lot of people buy stuff there, too. We've seen a lot of potential for us to make money on Android, and I think you'll see us increase that a lot over time. It's hard to give you details about that right now, but I'm very, very optimistic.
Patrick Pichette
On the second part of the question, let me jump in. If you look at our growth -- first of all, you're right that FX played a part. You also have to remember that last year at this time, right, we had such a strong comp. We had such an amazing Q4 of 2010. That the year-over-year comparison in a way represents also this really high kind of level on which to start from. And so from that perspective -- and if you also look at our mix between our own Google websites versus all of our network, I mean, our core properties continue to be actually very strong. So for all these reasons, I wouldn't be worried of the way that you've described it. In fact, we've got -- continue to have very strong growth.
Operator
And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I just had another follow-up on CPC. And kind of as you look out given -- to the first half of the year, and given the metrics that Susan rank-ordered or impacting them in Q4, how do we think about how those metrics that you rank-ordered might impact them in the first half of the year or just even looking out over the next quarter? What are the things we should be paying attention to?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, I mean, at the highest level and then maybe Susan can jump in if she wants to add additional, if you think of the core elements of it, she mentioned quality. And we -- the -- all of the Panda changes and everything we talked about, right, its full year is going to be represented only by the next spring. And then FX rate, we don't control ourselves. So obviously, it has a significant impact. The rest of it is actually the mix between how the innovation that we drive to our products, which is if you have a great product that drives a ton of clicks and it happens to have lower cost or CPC, then that's still for the benefit of everybody. So then, that's really about our innovation agenda, but we don't give forward guidance on that.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Right. But it just looks like those trends that you mentioned that impacted Q4 are in existence as we look out, at least initially, into 2012.
Patrick Pichette
I think you have to make the call on the FX yourself. And then on the...
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Aside from FX, obviously, right.
Patrick Pichette
Yes, yes and then the quality, I think will going to -- flow through the year, sometime in the spring.
Susan D. Wojcicki
I mean, the one thing I would just add is, the way we think about the business is we're focused on how do we provide better ads for our users and for our advertisers, and we look at all of those metrics combined. And what we saw in Q3 was we made a bunch of changes. They were small. There was no one individually that actually affected things, but it just so happened that the changes we made drew more attention and caused an increase in paid clicks. And so, as I mentioned, there are many factors. But really, what we use as a guiding metric are to understand that something is revenue, advertiser and user positive.
Operator
And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford C. Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Help me reconcile the 15% year-on-year growth in Google partnered revenue with the 130% growth in the DoubleClick Exchange and the $5 billion run rate for Display. I mean, something -- it seems that something must be decreasing. And how do we make these numbers close?
Patrick Pichette
Look, I think that you have to remember -- in the highest level, you have to remember that sites and network lines in our financials are not good proxies for Search and Display revenue, right? I mean, in its most simple term, YouTube, which is Display, right, ends up in our Google sites. And yet, AFS which is Search, is included in the network. So when people actually do the math, right, it's really easy to get confused between these lines. So I would kind of caution you to have one which is growing at 15% obviously being -- jumping to the conclusion that that's Display. That doesn't work.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
So does that mean that a material portion of the $5 billion come from YouTube?
Patrick Pichette
All I'm saying is we don't give the breakdown, but you could -- I just want to make sure that you --  caution you that because of these mix issues, right, it can lead to interpretations that are wrong.
Operator
And we'll go next to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
I just wanted to go back to the CPCs for a minute. And it sounds like -- and we can obviously take the FX out, but it sounds like you're saying that the improvements in 3Q were perhaps a much bigger factor than the mix shift toward mobile in terms of CPCs. Susan, can you provide any more color there in terms of the improvements that you made which could drive sort of a meaningful shift like that? And then secondly, TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues have been down for many straight quarters now, and here they ticked back up a little bit. Can you clarify that at all, the reason for that?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, on the latter -- let me just jump in on the latter and then I'll let Susan give a bit more color, commentary. But it's just mix issue between partners. So as you have partner mix, it will just affect. But it's not a dramatic number, by the way, right? It's still kind of hovering around 24. So it hasn't plummeted in any way shape or form.
Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Is it more partner mix? Or is it possible that it's more mobile mix like desktop to mobile?
Patrick Pichette
Yes is the short answer. But partners mix affects it as well. Like, it's not only mobile, I guess, is my point. I'll let Susan give you more details on the colors of the -- if any, on the changes that we've done that would have impacted the CPC.
Susan D. Wojcicki
So the 2 biggest factors, as I mentioned, were the FX and also the changes that we made to -- in terms of ad quality or format changes that we made. And those were changes that we made in Q3. There was no, I think, one significant one that drove the metrics. Or like this quarter, we made 20 different changes. Last quarter, we made something similar. And it was the combination of those different changes. Now it's important to remember that we rolled those out over the course of Q3. And so that meant that if we rolled one out at the end of Q3, that you wound up seeing that impact in Q4 period. And so there was a cumulative effect. But again, there was not any one big one. It was the sum of a bunch of other changes. And those changes that we wind up making are changes that may make the ads more readable, they may be more visible, they're UI treatments or quality changes. They're a bunch of different things that make it more visible so that users are noticing the ads. And we see those as positive. We measure the metrics, how do our users respond, how do our advertisers respond. And they are revenue positive.
Patrick Pichette
Yes. Another way to think about this is in many quarters, we would have a bunch of them that would actually move down the CPC, a bunch of them that would have moved up in [ph] click. It just happens that in the latter part of this year, they kind of all moved one way, which is not neither good nor bad. It just happens that the quality team and the advertising teams actually have kind of unearthed these type of opportunities. So it's a bit of circumstantial as well.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jeetil J. Patel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Two questions. First of all, I think, Larry, early on you referred -- you talked about shuttering a couple of products and then doubling on key products that are showing some quite bit of success. I guess can you speak to are you still innovating across new products around the consumer? And anything that's not tied to advertising as we look ahead? Second question, can you talk about -- I guess when you look at mobile distribution costs in general, do you envision a scenario where mobile distribution costs stay about where they are today? Or how do you think those kind of play out over time as you think about the development of the mobile market?
Larry Page
Maybe I'll take the first question and Nikesh can take the second part of the question. I think we -- I didn't mean to imply in any way that we're stopping innovating. And I think we will continue to launch new products in new areas and things that aren't necessarily advertising supported, as we have been doing for a while. And I'm very excited about that. But we may not launch 100 such things. We may launch a few of those such things over the next few years. I think we'll try to make sure we're more concentrated in our efforts to make sure we're producing really amazing products for our users and for our customers that are really well thought out and work really well. And so, I mean, we've put a lot of effort into those things. So we're just really just been concentrating our efforts around our innovation and making sure we're doing a really great job on the things that we really care about and that really matter to the world. And so that's very consistent with sort of everything I’ve said. Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
Yes, I think on mobile distribution, it's pretty similar to what happens on Search today. Many consumers get their mobile applications from Google directly on their devices. Some people get them through our distribution partners, and some people get them through our carriers. And to be honest, the distribution costs really depend on the mix of those devices. And you can see, traditionally the mix is less and less specific to other distribution partners in the middle, and more and more people are organically getting access to device and applications that they choose given the large plethora of opportunities and options that they have.
Operator
And we'll go to Justin Post, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
A couple of things. Patrick, on the hedging program, you had $134 million loss on the expenses of getting the hedges, but you only made $25 million and it was a pretty volatile quarter. Do you have a lot of backlog saved up for next year in profits? And is this working the way you want? And then maybe for Larry, obviously CPC growth is really accelerating. Can you explain why that's good for Google and why you think you're going in the right direction? The mix seems to be a big controversy, but obviously you're making these changes. Can you really explain the positive benefit to the user experience or to the company?
Patrick Pichette
So on the first question, actually thanks for your question, Justin, because I'm sure a lot of people are thinking about that. Our hedges -- so the cost that we accelerated is actually relative to the entire portfolio of hedges that we have that spans over 18 months forward. So what -- think of it as a complete program that extends 18 months out and -- of which think of it like a bond ladder, right, with a lot in the short term and -- less in the long term. All of those hedges, right, you have to mark to market. And when you have to mark to market, they're so much in the money. Then you have to actually accelerate your expensing of them. So you're absolutely right that today as we stand or as we close our books on the 31st, right, they signaled about the weakness of the euro because the euro had lost quite a bit in the quarter and relative to our portfolio. So we would -- if things stayed exactly the same, right, we wouldn't reap a lot of benefits in the coming quarters and wouldn't have those expenses because we took them all in one shot. So I hope that makes sense. And it's really tied to FASB 133 that doesn't allow you to just do it pretty [ph] early.
Larry Page
I can take, say, a little bit about CPC from my perspective. I think -- and I don't have the detail here, quarter or whatever, but I do think that CPCs -- do vary a fair amount, and we're not surprised by that. There are lots of product changes that we can make that can increase CPCs or decrease CPCs and kind of have a -- or an inverse effect on the number of clicks and sort of not change the actual dollars spent, for example. And that's not that surprising because we can do things that -- in product changes that affect people’s attention to ads that Susan mentioned or that affect the quality of the conversions that advertises receive. They might receive better quality clicks, or they're -- or those -- each CPC that they got that's more likely to convert into  what they care about. And so we are constantly optimizing all those things across a number of different product areas and ad placements and everything else. And our advertisers are doing the same, and the algorithms are also doing all that. So I think in any healthy economic -- economy, like we have of advertising, we're going to see variation in the different factors we use to measure it. And I'm not surprised by that.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Are you happy with the results in the quarter? Are they going the direction you expected based on the changes you made?
Larry Page
As I said, I'm very happy with our results overall in the quarter. And I think those are a function of all the metrics that we gave you. So yes, I'm happy with our results.
Susan D. Wojcicki
Yes. I mean, one additional thing I'd like to say about the increase in paid clicks is the increase in paid clicks, in a lot of ways, is a proxy for where the ad is useful. Do the users find interesting enough to click on them? Do we have enough advertisers who served ads? So an increase in paid clicks shows that our advertising system is working, that we have more advertisers, we have more clicks. And as Larry alluded to, there are many, many different variables that go into it, but an increase in paid clicks is something that we see as a sign that our advertising system is in demand and it's healthy.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I'll ask about paid clicks and their relationship to CPCs. There's a third-party data that suggest that paid clicks continue to grow faster than free clicks. And so the 34% paid click growth that you reported, it would seem to make that fairly accurate that there's a mix shift that's occurring in favor of paid versus free. And with search quality improvements as the driver of this potentially, it would seem that advertisers would be paying more for better distribution, yet CPC is down. So if you were to look at your business on a same distribution basis normalized for mobile and increased ad coverage and all the other potential drags on CPC, I'm just -- the question is a simple one. If you look at advertisers, are they paying more or less on a unit basis for distribution?
Patrick Pichette
I think that -- let we make 2 statements on this. The first one is that we shy from talking about -- anything about specific which is third-party data, because typically we find there are so much errors and methodology issues with them. I think that we're seeing -- what we have clearly seen this year once again, right, is more holiday shopping happened online this year again, right. Nikesh talked about, right, record Cyber Sundays and Fridays that are black. And, I mean, all of these things have hit record year -- this year again, and we're seeing again a transition of off-line to online. I think that Susan's last point is really the critical point, which is as we're moving and exploring formats that really work well for both the advertiser and the user, you should see a symptom which is more clicking. And that's exactly what we see. And if there's a slight pressure on the CPC as a consequence of it, but overall we get a better result, right, that's actually a pretty healthy environment and an innovative one. And then -- and just again, as we mentioned and as Susan said, it happened that in Q3, we had just a number of them that just went one way. And I wouldn't read any data points in that as saying that that's the future or that it will not revert back to others. It's -- that's just the nature of experimentation in our systems.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
I guess I'll spare you on CPC. I have actually a couple of questions for Larry on Google+. Last quarter, I think you referred to it your as social lair. And I guess I almost think of it like Google's -- it's like your social operating system, I guess, to a certain extent. So I'd love to get your vision on how you think G+ can improve engagement across all your properties. And then the second question would be, identities that are on Facebook and Twitter, do you think ultimately those firms will open up the data stream and we could see even richer results with clearly Facebook- and Twitter-like information?
Larry Page
Yes. I think we see -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks that we see really engaging with users on -- really deeply understanding who they are by getting them the right things that make sense for them and so on. It's really, really important. And I think we are at the early stages of that, and Google+ is a big part of that effort. If you look at some of the things we've done, I think that if you look at in Search, you can do a search now and get somebody's name and have that name really appear as a chip in the search. And that means that it's no longer a string that you're searching for, it's actually a real person. That notion of identity is really a deep, deep part of what we're doing. And it's an example of how we can make all of our products better by really understanding people. So we definitely think about that. There's a reason why we called it Google+ in that way. I think -- and so I think you're -- you've got the right idea in general about that. I think that -- I think with other big companies, other big companies that work on social data and so on, I think we've seen very much general tendency to wall that data up and to wall the card in and not make the data available. Where we have publicly been able to access the data -- for example, in Search, we've provided a lot of third-party social data in Search, and we love doing that and we'd love to have more such data. But in general, I would say companies generally have been walling that data up, and we'd love to be able to use more of it.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Great. Can I maybe ask a follow-up and get a prediction from you in terms of how many G+ users you expect in a year or so?
Larry Page
Oh my goodness, I won't try to predict that. But we're very excited about the growth we had, and we're certainly seeing tremendous number of people being added every day.

And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Two quick questions, neither on CPC. Susan, on Google Offers, quick question there. Given Google [ph] and LivingSocial’s early success in this space, it seemed like scale is an advantage in the local and national deals area. Is there any reason why Google is only in 30 markets to date? It seemed like you've got all the merchant relationships that you need. So is there something else that's preventing a broader rollout? And then a follow-up for Nikesh on Europe. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that Germany was a little weak in the quarter. Can you give us a little color on which verticals? Was it travel, retail, finance? A little color on the verticals that were weak. Or was it broad-based?
Susan D. Wojcicki
So right now, we have 30 markets to date, and that's just what we have to date. So as there are more markets and as it makes more sense for us over time, then we will roll out more markets. But I do think that there is -- it's very important to understand what's working in a specific market and in a city and perfecting that and really understanding the dynamics that make sense for us for the success of that city. And so as we expand, we'll expand with that knowledge. And we'll expand as we -- as it makes sense for us in terms of the users, the solution and building all of those learnings that we've made in those initial 30 markets.
Patrick Pichette
Nikesh, any comments on your side?
Nikesh Arora
Yes, I guess in terms of verticals, generally auto has been strong around the world. We've seen that. And then in different markets, different verticals have been special in terms of the -- the U.S., we had – education, we had health. So there have been different vertical performances around the world. And Germany has been a market which has been doing really well for us in the last few quarters. So part of it is we're running up against some very, very tough comps versus last year. But it was general sort of weakness across the board. It wasn't specific to any particular vertical that has changed.
Larry Page
I should mention, too, you can actually go to Google Insights for Search, and you can look at our Search free graph over time for any of these verticals yourself. It's some great data.
Operator
And we'll go next to Herman Leung with Susquehanna International Group.
Herman Leung - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Just 2 quick questions. First, I remember last year in the fourth quarter there was a pretty big change that you guys made on the quality side, which I think you mentioned a bit on the prepared remarks. Wondering if that -- how much of a headwind that was relative to the fourth quarter of this year. If there's a way you could sort of quantify that. And second question is the hiring rate that you guys have made, 1,100 people, this quarter. Wondering -- that's a bit of a slowdown from the previous quarters in the past. Wondering if there was something there to look into.
Patrick Pichette
So a 1-2 punch on this one, Herman. On the first one, we mentioned it because we thought it was material. It was such a big impact last year. We don't comment on the specifics, but it was sufficiently material that that's -- you're absolutely right that it created a headwind for us this year. No doubt about it. And that's why we mentioned it. On the second question, you'll remember that in Q3, we kind of had a double hitter where Larry had already said that we had reached what was kind of tolerable in terms of the pace of hiring.
Larry Page
The edge of what’s manageable.
Patrick Pichette
The edge of what is manageable. And thank you, Larry, for that clarification. And we also had at the end of Q3 all of the -- we had the summer -- everybody comes -- leaves -- comes from school, comes into Q3. So we had quite a bit of a bump in Q3. We're really pleased by -- and you can see in our results now that actually, it's a good evidence of we're managing -- we have managed down our numbers into Q4, and a good evidence of we are managing it to make it digestible for us.
Operator
And we'll take our final question from Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company.
Youssef H. Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
So first, one product we didn't talk much about is Google Wallet. So I was wondering that based -- if based on your early test, is that a product that you're planning on doubling down on? And if so, what is the path to wider adoption? And second, on MMI, I know the deal hasn't obviously closed yet. But just given the size of that transaction, it certainly has the potential to really change Google's growth and margin profile pretty significantly, which is a big concern to many. So at a very high level, Larry, I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about your commitment to be a principal in the handset business. And if so, how does -- how do you avoid channel conflicts with the partners?
Susan D. Wojcicki
Youssef, this is Susan. So I can talk a little bit about Google Wallet. And so as Larry has mentioned a number of times, we want to focus on products that people use every day. So products that are core. And all of us use our wallet every day. And we think that's a big opportunity for us. So we are continuing to invest in our Wallet business. And we see a lot of opportunity. And for example, there might be opportunities in the future in terms of how online and off-line are linked together, and better opportunities with the way different parts of our business wind up working. So we are very excited about Wallet, and we will continue to invest in it.
Larry Page
And I should mention on Motorola obviously we're going to break that out separately, so you’ll be able to track the changes to margins and so on. I think that -- and able to track the business separately. So that should not be an issue. We've been very clear that Motorola's obviously going to remain a licensee of Android, and Android will remain open. And when we announced the deal, we really said our strategy is working with different manufacturers on lead devices is going to continue. And Motorola will bid with -- just like any other OEM for those devices. So that process will be unchanged. And obviously, I think we have done a great job managing our partner ecosystem. That's a difficult thing to do, and I think we do it quite well. And I expect we're going to continue to do that well with Motorola. And obviously, it shows our commitment to Android in making sure that we have the freedom to innovate and as do all of our OEMs.
Patrick Pichette
So even more specifically, we -- you can expect segmented reporting for Motorola. So the Google will continue to be very clear in terms of its performance and transparency to investors. Motorola will also, on its own, be very clear and transparent to investors. And just before we close the call, just a reminder to everybody, as the headcount question that was asked a minute ago reminded me. As we launch into Q1, it's important to remember that there's a lot of expenses. As people kind of think of resetting their models, it's really -- I just want to remind everybody because every year we go through this, that the employer taxes and 401(k)s and all of the things that launch into Q1 typically get reset. And so I just want to give a friendly reminder to all our -- the people that have financial models out there to make sure that -- to take that into consideration because it surprises everybody every year. So rather than get another surprise at the end of Q1, I just thought I'd remind everyone. On that note, I think it's really -- I'd love to, once again on behalf of the 4 of us here, thank profusely our Googlers. I mean, they do an amazing job and, as we said, landing a great quarter, crowning a terrific year and really well set for an absolute exciting year for 2012 and look forward it. So on that, Jamie, I'll let you close the call.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google Inc. Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jane Penner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Jane Penner
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Susan Wojcicki, Senior Vice President, Advertising; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer. 
First, Larry, Patrick, Nikesh, and Susan, will provide us with their thoughts on the quarter. Also, as you know, we now distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings release, as well as supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours. 
Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments and our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. 
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are also expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Larry.
Larry Page
Well, thank you, and it's great to be here, and thanks for taking the time to be with us today. When I look back over the last quarter, the word that springs to mind is gangbusters. Revenue was up 33% year-on-year, and our quarterly revenue was just short of $10 billion, not bad for a 13-year-old. 
I'm also incredibly excited about the progress we've made on the product side. Ever since taking over as CEO, I had to focus much of my energy on increasing Google's velocity and execution, and we're beginning to see results. 
Look at Google+, we had 100 features launched in 90 days, the team is really cranking. We had Hangouts on the phone, Hangouts on air, Will.i.am did a Hangout from his concert in Central Park. You can now share Circles. You can search Google+ and you can play games in Google+. And far and most exciting of all, open sign-ups, Google+ for everyone. 
Looking at the numbers for Google+, I was taken aback. I now want to announce that we passed the 40 million user mark on Google+. People are flocking into Google+ at an incredible rate and we're just getting started. 
The engagement we're seeing is phenomenal too. Over 3.4 billion photos have already been uploaded in Google+. But it's still incredibly early days for Google+ because our goal is actually far bigger than the individual feature launches themselves. Our ultimate ambition is to transform the overall Google experience, making it beautifully simple, almost automagical because we understand what you want and can deliver it instantly. 
This means baking identity and sharing into all of our products so that we build a real relationship with our users. Sharing on the web will be like sharing in real-life across all your stuff. You'll have better, more relevant search results and ads. Think about it this way. Last quarter, we shipped the Plus, and now we're going to ship the Google part. The new visual design, beautiful, consistent UIs for Search, News, Maps, Translate, and lots of other features, is only the beginning of that process. 
Last quarter, I talked about focus, and we've made great progress here too. To create products that really change people's lives, that they use every day, 2x or 3x a day, is really hard. So we have to make tough decisions about what to focus on or we end up doing things that don't have the impact that we strive for. 
Since we last spoke, we've begun the process of shutting over 20 different products including Sidewiki, Google Pack, Google Notebook, and Fast Flip, and we'll continue to simplify and streamline our products going forward. This prioritization is crucial if we are to really invest in the extraordinary opportunities in front of Google today. 
Let me give you a few examples. Chrome, usage is going through the roof. We have now hit over 200 million users and still growing fast. Turns out that people really care about getting to the web quickly and securely and having a whole ecosystem of apps at their fingertips. 
I'm super pleased with Google Maps, it's a favorite with our users, especially on mobile devices. In August, we launched in 40 new countries, taking our total to 130 countries. The growth of Android is mind-boggling too. Over 190 million devices have now been activated globally. I'm super excited about the soon-to-be released new version of Android called Ice Cream Sandwich, that's right, Ice Cream Sandwich. You won't believe what we managed to get done in this release. 
We're also seeing a huge positive revenue impact from Mobile, which has grown 2.5x in the last 12 months to a run rate of over $2.5 billion. Generally, I found that high usage products will make a lot of money over time for well-managed technology companies, and that's why it's so important to run these businesses for the long term. 
That said, we must never lose sight of the fact that today's revenues and growth serve as the engine that funds all of our future innovation. People are a crucial part of Google's long-term success, because great companies are no greater than the efforts and ingenuity of their employees. So our goal is to hire the best people at every level and keep them at Google. Our hiring has to be manageable, if we are to balance our short and long-term needs. 
You may have noticed quite substantial hiring this quarter, driven in part by a lot of university graduates. Despite the seasonal effect, the total number of people we hired was about the same as last quarter. Our attrition remains low, which is great, though obviously it contributes to our overall current headcount. As I said previously, I continue to believe that our headcount growth is the edge of what's manageable. 
Let me finish by saying that we are still at the very early stages of what technology can deliver. These tools we use online will look very different in 5 years time. We're building those tools now as Google+, which is why I'm so excited to be here. 
So thank you. And again, we had a great quarter. And now I'll turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let me first turn to the specifics of our performance in the quarter from a financial perspective. Our gross revenue grew 33% year-over-year to $9.7 billion and 8% quarter-over-quarter. Note that while some currency fluctuation boosted our revenue again this quarter a little bit, even in constant FX terms, our growth rates remain very strong. 
Our Google website revenue was up 39% year-over-year to $6.7 billion and 8% quarter-over-quarter, which trends across most major geographies and verticals in fact. Our Google Network revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $2.6 billion and 4% quarter-over-quarter. 
On the one hand, year-over-year network revenue growth slowed slightly due to a few factors, including the Search quality changes that we made earlier this year that we already commented on. On the other hand, the momentum of our Display business, which comprises only part of the network line, continues. And Nikesh will have more to say on this in a few minutes. 
Our other revenue was up also 52% year-over-year to $385 million, and that was up 24% quarter-over-quarter. Our global aggregate Paid Click growth was very strong, up 28% year-over-year, and up 13% quarter-over-quarter. The corollary, the aggregate cost-per-click growth was up 5% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. Remember too that, that's an aggregate number, which includes both Google.com and our AdSense properties. As usual, there's some variability quarter-over-quarter in these metrics but, overall, we continue to be very pleased with our revenue and the performance of our ad system. Again, Susan will give you a few more comments in a few minutes. 
So turning to our geographic performance, the U.S. and rest of worlds are growing at a very healthy pace, and our results clearly reflect that. Even the U.K. continues to show some positive momentum. In our earnings slides, which you'll find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. 
Our revenue from the U.S. was up 26% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 55% of our total revenue or $5.3 billion, up 41% year-over-year, which includes a modest $1 million of benefits from our hedging program, and this is compared to $89 million benefit in Q3 of last year. The U.K. was up 25% to $1 billion and year-over-year growth and fixed FX still is pretty healthy and would have been 20% -- or is 20%.
Let me now turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition growth and costs were $2.2 billion or 23.7% of total advertising revenue. And our other cost of revenue was $1.1 billion, which exclude stock-based compensation of $72 million. 
Finally, operating expenses, also excluding SBC, totaled $2.8 billion. And SBC, itself, totaled $499 million in Q3. So our increase year-over-year in SBC is primarily due to the annual equity refresh, which we do at this time of year. And the increase in year-over-year for our OpEx was primarily due, as usual, in payroll, increased professional services and advertising and promotion spend. So as a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit was $3.6 billion in Q3, which exclude SBC, and are resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 37.3%. 
Headcount was approximately up by 2,585 versus Q2, ending the quarter with 31,353 full-time employees. And as Larry already noted, there are 2 factors at work here. Q3 usually has significant headcount additions and this quarter is no exception due to a bumper crop of university hires. In fact, we had the second-highest number of university hires in Google's history this quarter. Additionally, acquisitions this quarter added a large number of people as well. Our effective tax rate was 19% in Q3, flat with Q2, and the lower tax rate is driven by a mix of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries. 
Now let me turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $302 million for Q3. OI&E was driven by a strong portfolio management performance and, additionally, we saw lower-than-expected FX cash flow hedging expenses due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in September. For more details on OI&E, again, please refer to the slide that accompanies this call on our IR website. 
Operating cash flow was very strong at $4 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter, down from last quarter, to $680 million, and the majority of the CapEx once again in Q3 was related to facilities and production equipment. And as a reminder, we continue to make these significant investments in CapEx, and these have shown to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on where we're able to make these investments. We're very pleased with our free cash flow and consequence of all this, which was $3.3 billion. 
So before handing it over to Nikesh, I know that many of you have had questions about general economic outlook and have been kind of asking us those questions. Look, what we're seeing is not terribly surprising or different from what you're all seeing, watching on TV, reading in the press. And while, obviously, we don't control the economy or the exchange rates that fluctuate so much, we do very much control our own operating agenda. And that's why we will, as always, stay focused on what we control, our agenda for the long term, with the strategy and investments that are not calibrated for quarter-to-quarter views but really designed to create, as Larry said, fantastic products that transform our users lives and create significant value for our shareholders. 
With that, let me now hand it off to Nikesh, who will cover more details on our sales performance in this quarter. Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. I'll give you an update on our business activities. To reiterate what Patrick said, we saw strong performance across our portfolio, supported by the strength of our products. Our sales, customer support, marketing and partnership activities drove $9.7 billion in revenue this quarter. 
First, let me talk about the results for our advertising products, then our performance by region, and, finally, some highlights from our amazing marketing team. On Search, our core desktop Search business maintained its momentum. Google.com growth was faster than one year ago. Our syndicated Search revenue also accelerated this quarter with new large global deals contributing to our growth. 
We're monetizing clicks better by working closely with our clients to grow the value of search advertising. What's interesting is, we're increasingly able to link search marketing efforts to both online and off-line sales with various other media. This quarter, we worked with our clients, such as leading apparel retailer, H&M, to promote sales through classic search campaigns. Additionally, clients like J&J and Sharpie, use search advertising support large online branding campaigns on other media, like YouTube and our Google Display Network. 
Moving on to Display. Growth this quarter was robust, with products like YouTube and Google Display Network, we're giving advertisers more options to engage with their customers online. What's interesting is, we've seen a marked increase in our average spending from 2009. 2009, our top 20 display deals averaged approximately $2 million each. Now, our top deals are over 7x larger, averaging approximately $15 million each. 
Some of our biggest display campaigns this quarter came from DreamWorks and Disney. We've launched Space Lab, a partnership between YouTube and Lenovo. It is a video competition for 14- to 18-year-olds, in which winners will have the opportunity to send a science experiment to the International Space Station. So we keep doing interesting things to try and keep driving more usage and more revenues for YouTube and our Google Display Network. 
We have equally strong traction with our ad agency partners, with whom we're very excited about the partnerships we've developed. Just over the past 6 months, we've signed display deals of agencies which total almost $600 million to help deliver online advertising options to our shared customers, which all form part of our Display initiative. 
Let's turn to mobile advertising. Larry mentioned $2.5 billion as a run rate. Our revenue growth continues to accelerate even in Mobile, driven primarily by mobile search. This growth, obviously, is driven both by the underlying expansion of Android devices and of tablets, as well as stellar performance of our sales teams who are working closely with our customers to help them craft compelling mobile advertising solutions. Many advertisers have greatly increased the size and frequency of their mobile campaigns. Mobile is becoming a must-have. This includes clients like InterContinental Hotels Group, which spans pretty much across our entire portfolio of properties, including Mobile search, Mobile GDN and AdMob. 
Moving our sights to Enterprise. We see continued revenue acceleration in our Enterprise business. More companies are fundamentally going Google. Our Apps products continue strong growth with recent app wins, such as people like Goodyear and SOFTBANK of Japan. We're particularly excited, obviously, also, that we just deployed apps to 450,000 teachers in Morocco. 
Finally, Chromebooks have been available for purchase since mid-June, and we're beginning to see lots of interest and good uptake, both from the businesses and educational institutions. 
Let's switch gears and look at our country performance. If you look across countries, we continue to see strong business growth despite uncertainty in the global economy. In particular, North America was broadly stable this quarter. U.S. revenues have stayed on their gross trajectory, and Canada has actually accelerated. In much of Western Europe, we have seen some softness in ad sales. However, in markets like Spain, we are seeing that the sales execution efforts are continuing to keep our revenue stable and, in some cases, accelerate the revenue growth. 
Of course, across Asia and our key emerging markets, we grew much faster. Japan's post-earthquake recovery has continued and it's been driven primarily by large advertisers. We also see revenue growth in Australia, India, Brazil. They all are strong and they're continuing their strong growth trajectory. 
Finally, let me spend a few minutes on marketing and partnerships. Our marketing and partnership programs continue to help scale and grow usage of our products. Start, we're very proud of our Get Your Business Online program. This is a campaign which, basically, we work with our partners, we help small businesses and bring their companies online. This is great for the business, this is great for the economy, and this is great for future ad spending. 
So during Q3, we helped 7,000 U.S. businesses get online in places like Texas, Vermont, Kansas and Missouri. We also drove multiple customer launches this year. Our teams have helped expand the footprint for Google Offers, our deals business to about 11 cities in the U.S. after our pilot last quarter in Portland. 
Additionally, we continue to grow Chrome user base, which I talked about, the penetration continues to grow with our campaign called a Better Web campaign. We've laid the foundation for Chromebooks, which I talked about. If you haven't had a chance, if you fly Virgin America, you might have the opportunity to surf on a Chromebook in-flight. 
Finally, we've been supporting the growth of Google+, which we're very excited about, building a richer user experience by connecting users to public figures, celebrities, including Will.i.am from right onstage, Britney Spears, Richard Branson, just to name a few. 
In closing, we had a phenomenal Q3 and we hope to continue the good work for our customers, partners and users in Q4. I will now turn over to my partner and colleague, Susan, who will discuss the product performance of this quarter.
Susan D. Wojcicki
Thanks, Nikesh. Let start by talking about Search. We had another great quarter for Search quality with over 100 launches. We improved our preview feature so that when you hover your mouse over a search result, a large thumbnail of the site appears on the right. We also expanded the site links feature to include more links, with full snippets for each link. 
A good example of this is when you search on Metropolitan Museum of Art. You can see links to exhibits, the store, and general information. What I love about features like these is they magically make Google easier to use. 
The same goes for our new speedy Flight Search option. When you enter a query like SFO to JFK, and then click on the Flight link on the left-hand side panel, you can see all the different flight options. You can sort it in a variety of ways, airline, pricing, nonstop, times, and bring up a map that shows the flight route and other potential destination and prices. Flight Search combines IT expertise with Google technology. We are still very early with the product. Think of this first version as the takeoff, not the final destination. 
Turning to our Ads business. As Patrick mentioned before, our revenue growth was very strong. We are pleased with the Paid Click growth, which increased this quarter while keeping ad quality high. After a number of quarters of strong CPC growth, we continue to see year-on-year CPC growth. As we have said in the past, these average CPC metrics incorporate a number of factors, including mix effects such as Mobile and emerging markets, as well as true changes to keyword prices. It's also important to look at clicks and CPC metrics together, since more clicks can often lead to decreases in average CPC and vice versa. 
We also made a number of improvements to our core advertising product. Starting with the local and the small business market, we launched AdWords Express in the U.S. and started product trials in the U.K., Germany, and France. There are a lot of businesses who want to advertise online, and they haven't done so because they're too busy running their business. AdWords Express makes it possible for these businesses to start running an ad campaign in just a few minutes. The advertiser gives us some basic information, and we do all the rest. The keywords and the bids are automated. 
We're excited about this product because we believe it's the first time we successfully simplified all aspects of AdWords, while keeping its effectiveness for local and small businesses. And the results, so far, are quite positive with our advertisers. 
With regard to the local market, we also expanded Google Offers to 11 cities. The latest launch was in Miami last week. On the other end of the spectrum are large businesses and agencies. We made a number of significant improvements to Google Analytics this quarter, since we know that when site owners have more insight into site traffic and better information about how to optimize their campaigns, they tend to increase their spend. 
This quarter, we launched multichannel funnels in Google Analytics. This gives marketers aggregate information and insights into the full path to conversion, including clicks from paid and organic searches and display ads, not simply the last click. So advertisers can tell which marketing and ad programs are working. 
We also added real-time reporting to Google Analytics so that marketers and publishers can see what is happening on their site right now. This is especially useful to measure the immediate impact of social media. So if you put up a new blog post, or you send out a Google+ update, you can instantly see what happens to your site traffic. We also launched a premium version of Analytics with more data, advanced tools, dedicated support, and service level guarantees. 
Nikesh mentioned how well things are going with display advertising. From a product perspective, we'd like to highlight interest category marketing. We've completed rolling it out to all advertisers at the end of Q2. And since then, thousands of advertisers have signed up and the annual run rate has doubled. With interest categories, we look at the types of pages a user visits, and associates their browser with relevant interest categories, such as ecotourism, mobile phones, or hybrid cars. Then advertisers can show that user relevant ads across all types of sites. Users can opt out at any time, but the results of interest category ads is that they are more useful to users and more effective for advertisers, which, in turn, leads to higher returns for publishers.
We are making it a lot easier for advertisers to set up and manage video ad campaigns on YouTube, and the Google Display Network, as well. We began beta testing AdWords for Video, which integrates video buying campaigns directly into the AdWords interface. 
The momentum around Google+ is starting to apply to our ad products as well. Users can now +1 Display ads on the Google Display Network, and we've had +1 buttons on search ads and results since the end of Q1. Although it's still pretty early, our data shows us that ads and results that are socially annotated are more relevant for users. 
And finally, we shipped Google Wallet to Sprint Nexus S 4G phones and started working with Visa, American Express, and Discover as partners so their cards could be added to future versions of the apps. This morning, I bought my latte using my phone as a wallet. I'm looking forward to leaving my traditional wallet at home in the future. 
That's it for now. Thanks, and back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Susan. So we'll circle back with Jamie to open up the call and take your questions. Thank you, Susan, Nikesh, and Larry. So everybody, grab their handsets, and we're ready to go. Jamie, we'll look for you for instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
I've noted the proliferation of newer, richer ad formats, like product listing ads. Can you help us understand the impact on your financial model? Are they more or less profitable to you? And then secondly, on your comments on Western European ad sales softness, is the softness across all formats or are Mobile and display holding up generally better?
Larry Page
I think I'll ask Nikesh to answer that.
Nikesh Arora
Yes. I think we are constantly improving search as well as improving our ad formats. So if you look at our revenues, we will always be trying to drive new ad formats to our customers because we believe they are better, they provide better information, both to the user as well as they're great for the advertiser. Effectively, I'm not going to comment on the profitability of the ad formats except for the fact that they're great for users and advertisers; and good ads are delivered, and users click on them more, obviously, it will have an impact on the financial end. I'll let you figure that one out. In terms of my comment on Western European ad sales, it was more of a relative comment vis-a-vis prior quarters as opposed to an absolute comment about softness. Generally, we're seeing that the economic impact in some of those markets might flow through to some of these things, but it's just mildly soft. We're generally comfortable. Generally, queries are growing up. People are happier with Mobile, people are happier on Display. We're seeing Search query growth. So it's a bit of a mix across-the-board, but it should not -- it's just slight softness, not weakness.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
On that paid click growth, that's a real sharp acceleration but the organic revenue growth didn't sharply accelerate. So could you just provide some color on that? Is that just this market shift towards Mobile searches? What's driving that? And secondly, what's behind that other revenue that really spiked as well?
Larry Page
I'll let Susan take that. Susan?
Susan D. Wojcicki
Yes. So there were certainly a number of factors at play in terms of the CPC and the Paid Click growth. But the most important thing that I want to emphasize is that it's really important to look at these 2 factors together. Since they often move in reverse from one another. The other thing is there certainly was a mix factor where we do see changes in our mix, and that sometimes does have impacts on how our CPCs are -- how the aggregate ones are being affected.
Nikesh Arora
Just on other revenue, let me comment on other revenue. It really is the year-over-year impact of ITA. So, Mark, that's really the key issue there.
Operator
And we'll go next to Spencer Wang with Crédit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Just 2 quick ones, if I could. First, Larry, on the $2.5 billion Mobile run rate revenue, could you give us a rough sense of how much of that is Mobile search versus Display, perhaps? And then the second question relates to the people strategy. Given, Larry, what you said about being at the edge of what's manageable, should we expect headcount growth to moderate in 4Q and into 2012? And are you contemplating any sort of adjustments to base salaries as you saw earlier this year?
Larry Page
Yes. And I think that we're not going to break out more than we've already given you there. So we thought it was important to show the tremendous success of our business, and so we want to give you a nice milestone for that, but we're not going to break out more data. And also, on headcount, like I said, I think I had already said we're at the edge of what's manageable in terms of our headcount growth and you see our numbers are, as I said, were consistent with last quarter. I think we are always running our business very carefully and prudently, and making sure we're investing in the right places. And we make those kind of decisions every day. And we don't give guidance on what we're going to do in the future.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research
A couple of questions. First, could you discuss the strategy around video content? It seems to me there's sort of UGC premium and then all the stuff in between. Is that how you're thinking about it? And if it is, how are you thinking about emphasizing each area? And then just quickly on emerging markets, you mentioned India and Brazil. Any chance you can quantify some of that, how fast are these markets growing? How big are they overall? Are these top 10 markets, how big are they in the overall scheme of the different countries?
Larry Page
Ben, I think we think about -- certainly, YouTube is just tremendously successful. It's going gangbusters in every way. And we see that site is redefining the way we think about video. And I'd also note that it's very small percentage of people's overall video usage still. So we see opportunities for tremendous growth there. I think the other interesting thing about YouTube is it really blurs the lines between the kinds of content you're talking about. You can move from one type of content to another very easily. And we're finding our users don't really think about it that way. They think about having a great user experience. And we see it as serving our users well, and serving all the content creators well, regardless of their size. And that seems to be working great for us. And for the second part, Nikesh will take that.
Nikesh Arora
Yes. We're not going to break out the numbers for India and Brazil. But what I can give you directionally is both of them are very, very important markets for us. Our products are successful. You see search traffic continuing to rise. YouTube is very popular. Chrome is very popular. So really, we're very happy with the usage of our products, and we believe there's tremendous sort of runway in product usage in those markets because of the changing characteristics of those markets, both from an online penetration perspective and the economic growth perspective of those markets. So with that sort of tailwind behind us, we have great teams on the ground, which are driving businesses to come online. And we're seeing tremendous growth in the ad side, pretty much across-the-board and Display, Search and Mobile. So we're very, very happy with the success of those markets, with the progress of those markets. I'll just give you that as a directional statement.
Operator
And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
But I wanted to ask if you could give us a sense for how much growth in Mobile impacted Paid Click growth this quarter and how sustainable you think that level is? And also, if you could just tell us a little bit on the progress you're seeing in narrowing the gap between CPCs between Mobile and traditional search.
Susan D. Wojcicki
Yes, this is Susan here. So first of all, we don't really break out how Mobile impacted any specific part of Paid growth or CPC. I will say that our ad system is designed to be very flexible. There are always lots of different factors at play that we see changing in terms of users, queries, advertisers, bids. And so, really, we are designing our ad system to be as flexible based on what we're seeing at that specific moment. In terms of narrowing the gap between -- in CPCs of Mobile and traditional search, we see a lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow Mobile. And for example, advertisers having landing pages that are mobile-enabled, we can continue to improve a lot of our algorithms. So we see opportunity for us to continue to improve that over time.
Larry Page
Yes. And I would mention too, Heather, that the mobile phones are just getting amazing. You'll see our work there, and other people's works in coming out, that I think that your experience on phone could actually get to be better than your experience on a computer. I mean, the phone knows where you are, and can help you even when you're mobile and so on. So I definitely -- we definitely see that the experience on mobile improving greatly, especially with Android.
Susan D. Wojcicki
We've introduced a number of formats, just kind of building on Larry's point. So we have advertisers, we can give location. We can actually say, if you search on one specific store, that store is 0.1 miles from where you're located right now, with a map. Or include a phone number, when you click on the phone number, then that's like a CPC. So we're seeing that there are a lot of formats that we can really optimize for mobile, which will make for a great user and advertiser experience.
Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Larry, I know you have to be careful because of litigation, but maybe you could help us understand what steps Google can take to help defend the Android ecosystem on a big picture basis? There's a lot of questions about some licensing threats out there. And then, secondly, maybe this is for Patrick. Can you tell us what verticals performed well in the quarter? I know you've been able to do that in the past. But which verticals really did well in the quarter and maybe others that might have been a little slower?
Larry Page
I think we are very, like I mentioned, we are very excited about Android. And we see our partners and that whole ecosystem continuing to grow hugely. And while there's been lots of people trying to attack that and so on, we see absolutely no signs that, that's effective. And ultimately, we think that other companies' actions there will alienate their customers and their relationships with the other companies. So if anything, we see our strategy is getting stronger there. Obviously, we announced our intention around Motorola, and we're serious about protecting the Android ecosystem, making sure that, that continues to be incredibly successful. But we feel good about our efforts there.
Patrick Pichette
And on my side, Justin, look, we were -- again, quite a reflection of the economy around us. So the U.S., some of the verticals that have been stronger, right, travel, auto, you go to rest of world, interestingly retail, which is not as strong in the U.S. than it would have been in rest of the world because there's more activity in real estate and in retail in rest of world. In the case of the U.K., automobiles have been kind of particularly strong. And so these are the kind of verticals, again, they are a snapshot and reflection of the economy around us. And maybe Nikesh has kind of more color commentary on it.
Nikesh Arora
No. I agree with everything Patrick said. I think the only, sort of nonsecular event that's happening, is that we are continuing to see strength in the CPU verticals. Because we are doing well on Display and CPG have traditionally verticals that advertise more in display. So there was a bit of a opportunity there, whereas search wasn't their prime focus, but those guys are doing really well with the Display offerings we have for them. But I agree with Patrick with everything else.
Operator
And we'll go next to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Two things. First, one business you didn't really talk about was Google Offers. I was hoping you could add some more color there in terms of your strategy and what you think you can do differently in this space. And then, secondly, I know this is probably tougher but just related to MMI. We've obviously seen examples in the past around CPTN and Intel and McAfee, around writing in concessions in certain ways. Is that something that Google would potentially be willing to do, in terms of licensing patents, to open source software and then, also, delivering product updates and roadmaps at the same time as for MMI?
Larry Page
I think Nikesh will take the first question there.
Nikesh Arora
I guess it's early days for Google Offers. As I mentioned, we have expanded from one Portland trial to over 11 cities in the U.S. And we are leveraging some of the sales efforts we already have with our Ads business. We are leveraging our relationships with small, medium sized businesses. Google Offers, for us, is just one part of the overall opportunity to work with SMB. So it's early days. We're very happy with the progress we've made so far. You might have seen us launch Google Wallet, which is also a part of an enablement strategy for that. So, so far so good, very pleased with the progress so far.
Larry Page
Yes. As you know, Motorola deal is under review, and I think it would be premature for us to comment about anything we might do with regards to that.
Operator
And our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Just had 2 questions. In certain areas like shopping, payments, travel, reviews and mortgages, the company seems to continue to get deeper into the purchase funnel or closer to the actual transaction. And Susan, you noted the ITA example on the call. I was wondering if you could talk a little more broadly about this more vertical approach, the benefits of it, and the categories that you're particularly focused on. And then secondly, noncash stock-based comp, I think was up 31% sequential and 50% year-over-year. Patrick, you noted the annual grant. I was just wondering if this is the new run rate or if there is something one-time or, potentially, there's been a change in the cash versus noncash comp.
Patrick Pichette
Why don't I answer the last question first and then flip it over to Susan. I mean, you're seeing the full year impact of our salary raises last year flowing through in all aspects of our compensation. So when we did the equity refresh this quarter, obviously, it's augmented by the fact that people have 10% more salary and all of the corollary issues around it. So it is a onetime item but you're changing the plateau, if you wish, and then it will flow through into the next year and then it will stabilize itself. That's the best way to think about it. And then on the issue of the verticalization, I'll have Larry take a crack at it, please.
Larry Page
Yes. Thanks, Patrick. I think that we really think about Google as providing the exact right answers when you need them. And those things are not necessarily particular websites or whatever. They're actually -- maybe actually trying to get a very specific piece of information, like you do with an airline ticket, for example, as we were talking about. So I think we see this as a general instance of a problem, of just making search work better across anything you might want to be able to do. And we're pursuing that in a lot of different areas, and have our whole history, basically. So I think you'll see us do a better job of providing a great user experience on more and more specific things over time. And that's what we do, when we make a better search engine.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
I've got 2 questions. First, a quick follow-up on Android. So we've seen some of the Android partners now agreeing to pay Microsoft licensing fees. So in order to protect the ecosystem, is Google planning on subsidizing a portion of these fees? Or is there -- how does that strategy play out? And then second question on Google Wallet. Is the long-term plan here to partner with other financial transmitters, like PayPal and maybe their credit card networks for some of the heavy lifting in the payment space? Or does Google plan on kind of vertically integrating with the banking system to offer customer service and risk management around transactions for the Google Wallet customers?
Larry Page
I think that maybe I'll answer it in just kind of a general way. Rather than seeing, for example, Microsoft compete in the marketplace with their own smartphones, they've really continued resorting to legal measures to hassle their own customers, right? So it seems kind of odd. And we haven't seen the details of those total agreements, and I suspect that our partners are making good deals for themselves there. And so while there's a lot of press around that, we're really looking forward to our announcements with Samsung next week, which I think will be very exciting. And like I said, we see Android going gangbusters, and we don't see anything that's going to stop that. On your second question about Google Wallet and so on, I think we're very early. We just released a phone with Sprint, the Nexus S with Sprint, that's sold out and has had tremendous demand. And we think that the customers who have gotten that experience are amazingly excited about it. And like Susan mentioned, she can buy her coffee that way. And that's an amazing experience, and we're just at the very early stages of that.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jeetil Patel with DB.
Jeetil J. Patel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
A couple of questions. Can you talk about in the Mobile business as a whole, how do you structure some of the revenue sharing agreements that you have on the advertising side relative to in-browser searches? And I guess, who is it, typically, that you're typically paying for that distribution, the wireless carriers, the handset vendors, and how do you see that evolve going forward? And then I have a quick follow-up around kind of vertical integration. You've seen companies launch new devices, hardware-wise, to layer on top of some of the content and applications they sit on. You've obviously looked at Motorola now, and you're stacking from hardware OS into the applications environment. Do you think that, as you look at mobility, the world -- there's a unique opportunity to develop a much richer, deeper relationship? And I guess maybe a little bit more elaboration on the vertical integration there that you're looking at.
Larry Page
Yes, I mean, I think it's an exciting time. There's a lot of innovation going on in different business models and so on. I think we're very excited about our Android ecosystem and the growth of that. And I think we have very, very successful strategy there, as you see from the numbers that we talked about, over 190 million devices, and growing quickly. So I think there's many -- you're asking about different kinds of structures but we're very, very excited about the structure we have now, and about continuing that growth and continuing to evolve that platform ecosystem. And maybe Nikesh can take the second part there.
Nikesh Arora
I think Larry's right. There are many interesting models out there. As you know, Android is an open ecosystem, and our Mobile strategy is a very partner-focused strategy. So in many cases, we work with various partners to deliver the experience to the end user. And there are different partners, there are different value they bring to the equation, whether it's distribution, whether it's making Google Search part of their services, whether it's allowing us to be an ad-serving platform there. So each of the relationships are slightly different, and they have different negotiated deals with them. But generally speaking, I think we believe there's a fair value transfer to whoever in the ecosystem brings value to the table. And we get our fair share for providing services in that ecosystem.
Larry Page
We've been very successful with these models on the web, and we have a lot of experience with it, and I think we're good at doing those kind of deals.
Jeetil J. Patel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
It seems like owning content, at least in the Mobile space, seems to be a differentiator. Is that something that you'd possibly look at longer term? Is that owning more the content structure out there?
Larry Page
I think, again, we're not going to comment on what we might or might not do. I think that we've had very, very successful models for a long time without owning content. And I think many of the models of you see don't involve people owning content but actually selling it or distributing in various ways. And I expect that will continue.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
One of the threads that drew a lot of these questions in the Mobile market is, how do you increase monetization, and kind of where we're at. And I think one of the things I'd love to get your view on is where we are in the process of bringing together some of the disparate local services? How does Offers intertwine? And when does that sort of take on a little bit more of a unified feel versus sort of a set of one-off products that a user would use?
Larry Page
Jason, I think that's a great question. I think that -- I think first thing to keep in mind is that we're still very early in the Mobile business, and you see it's incredibly exciting business. There's a lot of activity. The user experiences are getting tremendously better, just growing like crazy. And there's a lot of economic activity and so on. So we've done well by having a long-term view about it. And I think that we also sort of want to balance having total integration with really fast iteration and fast progress and experimentation. And I think you definitely, I mentioned our unified look and feel that we've rolled out on Google which I'm very excited about, and we'll continue to do things like that, that really unify experience and make it more intuitive for people. But we're also going to do some experimentation, also, on new things, and then have a little bit less integrated. So it's always a mix of that. I think that offers, specifically, we think about our local business as being how do we help merchants and users, users like yourselves, get really good information and help the merchants get the right users at the right time and for the right amount of money, and so on. And that's a very hard problem across a whole bunch of different areas, basic information about merchants' interaction with between the merchants and the end users. And we have things going on in all of those spaces. And it's going to be a mix of, again, rapid iteration and also the integration of those things into, then, a more cohesive whole. And I'm very excited about that space.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays Capital.
Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I have 2. The first question is for Patrick or Susan. You cite your Mobile business as a run rate, which was very helpful. I was wondering if you could do the same for your Display business, particularly interested in YouTube, and so if you could comment on pricing and volume trends at YouTube in the quarter, at least directionally, that will be helpful. And then I have a follow-up.
Patrick Pichette
So we, as you know, we don't provide any guidance. We had this extraordinary moment this quarter in Mobile where we had a confluence of so many things going on. And that we thought it was on a onetime basis, again, appropriate to kind of provide number of users, the Android ecosystem that's going gangbusters. And therefore, it was, we thought, appropriate to kind of round it up with kind of a snapshot of where we stand. So for that reason, right, and because of the competitive nature of the environment in which we are, we don't divulge typically these numbers, and you shouldn't expect us to actually give you more information in the future on them, whether it be Display, or Mobile, or others. In the case of YouTube, it's the same thing. I mean, as Larry said, we're incredibly pleased about the growth of YouTube, whether it be the number of videos viewed a day, the revenue growth rates, the performance overall of the content, and the ad system within it. So I mean, all I could say is this is a really, really kind of well-growing property for us in which we are really excited.
Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Okay. And then just for Larry, I'm just wondering if you could comment on your broader media strategy. Unlike traditional cable providers, the Google platform isn't limited by geography. It's not limited by the contiguous networks or territories. So I just wonder -- there's been some conversation in the marketplace about a multichannel video offering in the U.S. to supplement your media product. And so I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that, even just philosophically, that would be helpful.
Larry Page
It's hard to talk about what we might do in the future, again. But I think, in general, I just think there's a lot of opportunity in providing better services for end users around media. And you see that, I mean, there's tremendous growth in all these businesses that are doing that. And I think we're, obviously, in a good position to help users find the content and the media and so on that they're looking for. And we're in a great position to also help those companies, and publishers, and authors, and content creators to find the right users, and get paid both through advertising and directly. And so I think that's just a logical place for us to be in, and a logical place where you'll see a lot of activity in general.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company.
James H. Friedland - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
Two questions. First, you'd talk about shutting 20 products and you've got some further products in Q1, I believe. Is there any way you can give us sort of a percentage in terms of how much resource that opens up? Is that sort of a 10% increase, or any kind of color you can give us there. And then second, at what level of Google+ users do you need to see a material improvement in ROI and Search, and really move the needle for the business there, just maybe in terms of active users?
Larry Page
Yes, I think those are great questions, Jim. I think that I'm not prepared to give you specific numbers about projects we shut down or whatever, but I will tell you, it's been a pretty significant effort, we've had to really streamline our business and we've made, like I said, tough decisions about where we should be focusing so that we really can generate amazing products and businesses. And those are not easy decisions. So I think there's significant resources involved in the kinds of things we're talking about. And it's also -- it's a fair amount of work, also, for us to just go through those -- that process. But I'm excited about that increased focus for us. I think, as I mentioned on Google+, I think we're seeing tremendous growth, which I'm very excited about. We're still very, very early. It's been out just slightly more than one quarter now, and not even fully open until -- only for a very small part of that. So I think we're very early in that. But on the other hand, I encourage you to all try Google+, and sign up, and flock to it. And you'll find that you will see data on search about what other people are doing. You'll see someone had +1'd something or so on. And I think those things can be very meaningful to you as a user. So I have no doubt that there'll be significant impacts from that.
Operator
That final question will come from Colin Sebastian with RW Baird.
Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Just 2 brief ones. First on Chrome and your efforts there to expand penetration. Can you talk about the specific drivers of growing distribution, adoption, maybe how we might expect this to impact margins over time? And then, secondly, the growth in the Google Site revenues. I wonder if you can add just a little bit of color there on the specific uptick, if that's an acceleration from a Display on YouTube as well as Mobile, or is that core search-related?
Patrick Pichette
I'll take the latter, and then maybe Nikesh will cover the Chrome. On the latter, the answer is yes. Yes, yes, and yes. So yes, YouTube; yes, mobile; yes, format. And I mean, that's why you see such an acceleration of our revenue, and that's why we're so excited about it. And maybe Nikesh, if you have comments on the Chrome and our penetration and how it's working.
Nikesh Arora
I'd love to answer the question like that, like yes, yes, yes. But unfortunately, that's not how the question is phrased. As far as Chrome is concerned, as we have talked about in previous quarters, Chrome is very strategic for us because we believe it is a phenomenal user experience and a user benefit. It just improves the user browsing experience so phenomenally. And we believe that it's important that Chrome be distributed, shared, with almost every user around the world. And a lot of our marketing efforts, and distribution efforts, have been focused around getting Chrome in the hands of our users. We are doing distribution with partners. Our partners encourage people to download Chrome. We are doing distribution where we do direct advertising to consumers to get them to download Chrome with a clear user benefit of better browsing, better video watching, and better security. So we are doing a lot of that. I think, I'm not going to comment on the margin part, but you have to understand, a great consumer experience from Google as part of Chrome makes Google -- makes users use more Google services. So from that perspective, we're very happy with the distribution strategy we have on Chrome. And we don't see any abatement of that strategy.
Larry Page
And I want to thank everyone for all the time that you spent with us. We had a great quarter, very excited about our progress so far. And I also want to thank all of our employees who've worked so hard to make these results that you all see. So thank you, all, very much.

A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours.
So let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments in our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. 
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin, are also expressed on a non-GAAP basis, and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to the Larry.
Larry Page
Well, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. It's really exciting to be with you today and share directly with you the progress we have made in my first quarter as CEO. 
As you will see from our press release, we had a great quarter, with revenue up by 32% year-on-year and a new record for quarterly revenue at over $9 billion. We've substantially increased our velocity and execution this quarter, which is a key goal of mine since taking over as CEO. So I created a new product focus management structure, with clear leaders responsible for each area. 
The new management team is working together fabulously and has already achieved a lot in just these 3 months. First of all, I want to talk about Google+, which we launched a field trial invitation only. Our goal at Google+ is to make sharing on the web like sharing in real-life, as well as improve the overall Google experience. 
Circles lets you choose with precision who you're sharing with, not surprisingly this has been very well received, because in real life, we share different things with different people. Hangouts allows for serendipitous interactions. Like in real life, when you run into a few friends, gives you seamless and fun multiuser video, and it's really amazing. 
Last quarter, we launched the +1 button in search results and ads, enabling users to recommend stuff they like and to have those recommendations show up in the search results of people they know. This quarter, we released the +1 buttons to the entire web and many sites like Huffington Post, The Washington Post, and Best Buy has added +1 buttons. Google+ is still in field trial with limited access as we scale the system. Users have to be invited and sign up with a profile in order to use it. However, the growth on Google+ has been great, and I'm excited to release some new metrics for you today.
Over 10 million people have joined Google+. That's a great achievement for the team. There's also a ton of activity, and we are seeing over 1 billion items shared and received in a single day. Our +1 button is already all over the web, and it's being served 2.3 billion times a day. So while we still have a lot of work still to do, we are really excited about our progress with Google+. 
Google+ is also a great example of another focus of mine, beautiful products that are simple and intuitive to use, and actually was one of the first products to contain our new visual redesign. We also launched that beautiful, consistent and simpler design on our homepage, Gmail and calendar, with many more products soon to come. Reader focus has also been another big feature for me this quarter. More wood behind fewer arrows and last month, we announced that we'll be closing Google Health and Google PowerMeter. We've also done substantial internal work, simplifying and streamlining our product line. 
While much of that work has not yet become visible externally, I'm very happy with our progress here. Focus and prioritization are crucial given our amazing opportunities. Indeed, I see more opportunities for Google today than ever before, because believe it or not, we are still in the very early stages of what we want to do. Even in Search, which we've been working on for 12 years, there's never been more important changes to make. 
For example, this quarter, we launched a pilot that shows an author's name and picture in search results, making it easier for users to find things from authors they trust. Of course, when we started doing Search, people thought we were crazy. They said there was no money to be made in search over and above a bit of banner advertising. Most new Internet businesses have had that same criticism. Fast-forward to today, it feels like we're watching the same movie again in slow motion. We have tremendous new businesses being viewed as crazy. Android, I actually have a new metric to report in Android of 550,000 phones activated a day. And that's a huge number, even by Google standards. 
Chrome is the fastest-growing browser. We have over 160 million users. Now people rightly ask, ""How will we monetize these businesses?"" Of course, I understand the need to balance the short-term with the longer-term needs because our revenues in growth serve as the engine that funds our innovation. But our emerging high usage products can generate huge new businesses for Google in the long run, just like Search. And we have tons of experience monetizing successful products over time. Well run technology businesses with tremendous consumer usage make a lot of money over the long term. 
And I think about our products in 3 separate categories. First, there is Search in our Ads products, the core driver of revenue for the company. And Nikesh and Susan are going to talk more about Ads later in the call. Next, we have products that are employing high consumer success: YouTube, Android and Chrome. We are investing in these in order to optimize their long-term success. Then we have our new products, Google+ in commerce and local. We are investing in them to drive innovation and adoption. Overall, we are focused on long-term, absolute profit and growth, as we have always been, and I will continue to have tight financial management we have had in the last two years, even as we were making significant investments in our future. 
I'd like to finish on our people. Great companies are no greater than the efforts and ingenuity of their people. We're continuing to hire the best. Keeping them happy and well-rewarded is crucial to our future. Many of you will be interested in hiring whether we hired a few hundred more or less than you expected this quarter. But we will optimize headcount for the long-term in the opportunities we see. 
I'm happy with the investments we've made in people, but we're probably even a little ahead of where we need to be with headcount growth at the edge of what's manageable now. Easy to focus on things we do that are speculative, e.g. driverless cars. But we spend the vast majority of our resources on the core products. We may have a few small speculative projects happening at any given time but we're very careful stewards of shareholder money. We're not betting the farm on this stuff. 
All of us at Google will want to create services that people in the world use twice a day just like toothbrush. And we strive to make those services beautiful, simple and easy to use. That way we can provide huge benefit to the world. We've made a good start, but we're only at 1% of what's possible. Google is just getting started, and that's why I'm here, working hard to lead the company in the next level. 
Thank you. And again, we had a great quarter. Now over to Patrick for the financial results.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Larry. Thank you, everybody. Thanks for joining us. And Larry is going to stay with us for the Q&A. So I just wanted to make sure that everybody knows he's not going anywhere. 
Okay, so let's go through the number. We had obviously an excellent quarter with 32% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2, and it clearly demonstrate the continuing power of Google's product innovation, but also the relentless momentum of the digital economy. The strength continues to be driven by our core desktop search ads, but also increasingly, by new emerging areas just like the Mobile, Display, including YouTube and Enterprise that we regularly talk about. 
So let's turn to the specifics of our performance in the quarter. Growth revenue grew 32% year-over-year and we've reached $9 billion in revenue, 5% quarter-over-quarter growth as well. Note that while currency fluctuation boosted our revenue somewhat, even in constant FX terms, our growth rates remain strong, particularly in what tends to be a seasonally slower quarter. 
Google website revenue was up 39% year-over-year to $6.2 billion and 6% quarter-over-quarter, with strength across most major geographies and verticals. Google Network revenue was also up 20% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, 2% quarter-over-quarter. Network revenue was again negatively impacted by the Search quality improvements made during the latter part of Q1, as you will remember, and know that Q2 reflects a full quarter of this impact. This impact is to be expected in the short-term, given that it is now different publishers that are receiving traffic and may not have yet optimized their sites for our advertising programs.
Other revenue was also up 20% year-over-year, just $310 million and 15% quarter-over-quarter. Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong, up 18% and down 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our UI changes to search ads such as BizURL drove year-over-year click growth in Q2, along with the ongoing and accelerating shift from offline to online. The slight decline quarter-over-quarter is just typically consistent with our summer seasonality. 
Aggregate cost-per-click growth was also very healthy, up 12% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Note that FX also had a positive impact on CPC, and remember too that this is an aggregate number that includes both Google.com and our AdSense properties. 
Turning to our geographic performance, the U.S. and Rest of the World are growing both at very good pace, and our results reflect that. While the U.K. still continues to lag slightly in the global recovery, year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in Q2 continues to show signs of acceleration in the U.K. as well. So revenue from the U.S. was up 26% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, and in our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and Rest of the World to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. 
Non-U.S. revenue accounted for 54% of our total revenue or $4.9 billion, up 38% year-over-year, which includes only $4 million of benefits from hedging programs, compared to last year where we had $79 million of benefits for Q2. Year-over-year growth in fixed FX would have been 29% versus the 30% I just mentioned. Japan's future revenue was again negatively impacted by the aftermath of the disaster there, but there again we see signs of faster recovery, faster than expected at first. The U.K. was up 27% year-over-year to $976 million, and year-over-year growth and fixed FX was still a healthy 19% for the U.K. 
Let me turn to expenses. Traffic Acquisition Costs were $2.1 billion or 24.2% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.1 billion dollars, including stock-based compensation of $51 million and finally, our operating expenses, which exclude stock based compensation totaled $2.6 billion. The stock-based compensation totaled $384 million in Q2. 
The increase in year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and promotional spend and also professional services. So as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $3.3 billion in Q2 which excludes the stock-based compensation, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 36.7%. 
Headcount was up approximately 2,450 versus Q1 ending the quarter with 28,768 full-time employees. When we exclude ITA adds of roughly 450, the net headcount growth is roughly similar to Q1. 
Our effective tax rate was 19% in Q2, and the effective tax rate is down due to the mix of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries, as well as our hedges. 
Let me turn now to cash management. In Other Income and Expense, our result was $204 million for Q2, a solid portfolio management performance from our team, which, like every quarter, is offset by the impact of our hedging expenses associated with FAS 133, which in itself was also significantly lower in Q2 gave us these great results. For more detail in OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
Operating cash flow, very strong, $3.5 billion for Q2. CapEx for the quarter was $970 million versus last quarter of $890 million. So pretty much in line. The majority of our CapEx spend in Q2 was related to facilities, expenses, and production equipment. And regarding specifically these facility expenses, like last quarter, we just happened to have a great opportunity in Q2 to purchase buildings in Dublin and in Mountain View, and we took opportunity. As a reminder, we'll continue to make significant CapEx investments, and these have shown to be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on when we're able to actually make these investments. But overall, we can be nothing but pleased with our free cash flow which was $2.6 billion for Q2. 
As Larry mentioned earlier, we continue to deliver growth with a disciplined agenda. This means investing and making sure that our resources are deployed wisely with focus and a balance between that short and long-term that Larry covered.
So with those financial highlights covered, I'm going to turn it over to Nikesh who will actually cover now our sales performance in the quarter. Here you go Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. I'm going to give you a quick update on our business activities, which spans sales, partnership marketing, and customer service around the world in support of our product and revenue. 
Let me start by focusing on the first priority of our sales team, the need to continue to drive revenue growth in core and new businesses. This quarter we continue to drive revenues in our corner areas like Search, as well as new areas like Display, Mobile, and Enterprise. Core Search and Desktop has done very well this quarter, with Google.com accelerating and our large advertisers continuing to spend more as they see more value in Search. We've also have been able to drive tremendous focus on small advertisers around the world, with programs like GXPO, which I will talk about slightly later. 
Broadly, however, our sales teams are getting better at tailoring Integrated Solutions for clients, using the full area of our advertising products. These solutions create better opportunities to improve our customers marketing ROI. Clients have used Search to focus their targeting capabilities, such us such as audience and topic targeting, to help improve the marketing effectiveness. Some of our most successful Search clients include people like GM and EgyptAir. 
On the other hand, in addition to our core desktop Search business, we continue to be very excited about our investments in Display and Mobile. Let me first focus on Display. We've seen continued healthy growth in our Display product space across all fronts: Advertiser, publisher and technology solutions. 98 of the top AdAge 100 advertisers have bought Display across YouTube and the Google Display Network this quarter. Customers continue to use our DoubleClick products and we are happy with the increased use for the DoubleClick Ad Exchange and Invite Media for ad buying. With our announcements to acquire Admeld, we hope to deliver even better solutions to our publishers and buyers. 
Continuing on Display -- on YouTube, where we have over 3 billion daily views, we have had great success bringing popular content to our users, further increasing audience engagement. Take for example, our April broadcast of the Royal Wedding which generated 100 million YouTube views. Our range of platform and content means that advertisers are beginning to use them for superior branding solutions. A great example of our branding products in action was T-Mobile's launch of the Samsung S4G on YouTube. In this campaign T-Mobile took over YouTube running ads in their home page, watch page, Mobile. That particular campaign helped them reach 46 million unique users. 
Continuing to talk about revenues, our Mobile business continues to be another area of robust growth. The number which Larry just shared of 550,000 Android, that and the success of smartphones in and general Mobile Data devices around the world is acting as an accelerator for our Mobile advertising effort. 
Let me just take one quick example. One format which was launched by Susan's team called Click-to-Call or Click-to-Share has been particularly successful. Unilever is a great use case of these formats. They integrated our AdMob product into a very large campaign of launching a new product to use the banner to drive traffic to a campaign Mobile site and achieve unprecedented results with almost 700,000 unique visitors accessing their content. 
Another leg of our revenues is the Enterprise Business. We've seen great results in enterprise as well, in particular apps for business continues to grow as organizations move to the cloud. We've had key wins at Intercontinental Hotels, [indiscernible] State of Wyoming. In addition to that, some small simple changes in our product side have allowed us to tremendously accelerate Google Apps for small businesses. 
Looking at our revenues from a slightly different perspective, geographies and customer segments, we've seen strong growth in regions and across customers of all sizes. First let's take a look at geographies, we maintained our strength in large, mature countries while we accelerated in emerging ones. 
Now a large majority of countries which are countries even though some of our facing economic challenges, this secular trend of online advertising and the effectiveness of the teams to continue to drive healthy revenue growth is showing great results. Several countries are worth noting as Patrick mentioned. The U.K. has accelerated this quarter with strong growth by small advertisers. In Japan, we've seen recovery, driven primarily by Display and Mobile spending by large advertisers. Our focused execution in Canada and Spain has led to these markets beginning to show recovery. Finally, we saw tremendous growth in emerging countries especially Brazil and Russia, where our Display products are getting strong adoption from advertisers. 
Across each country, we focus to improving the product knowledge and selling capability of our sales force, our frontline teams can now sell Search, Display, and Mobile to the needs of our customers, which is a great trend we're seeing of integrated products selling across multiple Mobile ad formats. As a result we're becoming better advisors in the digital space for our large advertisers. For example, Nike, Sony Ericsson, Telefonica, all of them partnered with us to create integrated solutions down there, sponsorship of Copa América.
Outside of revenue, one key area of responsibility is marketing. And if we continue to use marketing as a strategic blipper. We use marketing to both drive customer acquisitions as well as usage of our key consumer products. I'm very proud of my team's work on getting business online GXPO as I mentioned in Q2 we successfully launched Brazil, Canada, Australia Thailand. To objective is to try and bring another million small, medium businesses across 20 countries online for the first time. As you know, more advertisers gets more queries, has more adserves against it. There's nothing in a more robust option for us. 
In addition, also we saw strong results from our own advertising campaigns, including the most recent one around Google Chrome. The web is what you make of it. I'm sure many of you might have seen Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga in these campaigns. These campaigns have shown tremendous effectiveness and have also convince more users to switch to the Chrome browser. 
Last but not the least, I want to spend a quick minute on talking about something we're more and more passionate about, which is continuing to drive better customer satisfaction on an advertiser front. We continue to improve service and support across all customer segments. We've started providing large sets of advertisers proactive full support and on boarding help, which includes signing up for campaign building, signing up and getting assistance, as well as free full support after they become a customer of ours. As a result of these initiatives and others, spending by our small businesses continue to accelerate. 
Overall as Patrick and Larry have mentioned, it was a great quarter. I'm very proud of the wok of our teams across the world in various countries. We have done a tremendous amount of effort to serve our customers, partners and users. 
Now I'm going to turn over to my business partner, Susan, who is going to talk about all the positive impact that our products will have this quarter.
Susan Wojcicki
Thanks, Nikesh. Larry started the call by talking about a few of the quarters product highlights and I'd like to cover some more of them. So let me begin with Search. We're always looking for new ways to help our users find answers to their questions. This quarter, we brought 2 of the most popular mobile search innovations to the desktop, Voice Search and Search by Image. 
Voice Search traffic for Mobile devices is up 6x in the past year. So we thought this would be a useful feature for our desktop users as well. It's especially useful for searches that you know how to say but don't how to spell like Bolognese sauce or Schenectady, New York, neither of which I could easily spell. 
With Search by Image you can draw pictures of places, art, or even mischievous creatures like the Loch Ness Monster right into the Google search box and Google can identify and tell you about those pictures. 
In addition to these changes, we released about 100 other quality improvements to the Search algorithm. More and more people are searching and using apps from Mobile phones, where Android has had terrific momentum. There are now 135 million Android devices that have been activated in total, up from 100 million just 2 months ago. There are also now over 400 different Android devices available globally. 
Android market is also picking up momentum. It has over 250,000 different apps, and users have downloaded apps over 6 billion times, which is double the downloads from just a few months ago. We're expanding beyond apps too. This week, we started renting movies and selling books on phones from Android market and earlier in Q2, we launched Music Beta, which lets users upload their personal music collections and playlist to the cloud. All this media, movies, music, books and apps, are instantly available on their Android devices, no cable required. 
Smartphones are also becoming key to the shopping experience. Making shopping mobile and local is a vision behind Google Wallet and Google Offers. We announced the Google Wallet mobile app in May in partnership with Citi, MasterCard, Sprint, and First Data, and we are now testing it in field trials. And as of this week, Google Offers are available in San Francisco, Oakland, New York, and Portland. 
But now on to Ads, which is the product area that I manage. On the Search Ads side, we had a great quarter for quality with over 50 ads quality improvements and a big upgrade to the ads relevancy system. We launched the latest in a series of small tweaks for a search add format. This format, this quarter, we added the landing URL to the headline so that users know where click will take them. This may seem like a small thing, but we launched several of these small tweaks over the past year and cumulatively, they have had a big impact. 
There were also a lot of quality improvements across our Display Network. Over 20 launches, making it one of our strongest quarters from a quality perspective. In general, Display advertising is moving to a scientific model based on technologies like real-time bidding. But this technology when you land on a web page, advertisers decide what they want to pay for the ad space, and then auction is held. And the best ad is matched with the publisher's ad space. It's a lot more efficient. It provides better performance for both advertisers and publishers, and more relevant ads for users. Real-time bidding is an important technology shift that we are investing heavily in. 
Invite Media, which is the buying platform for advertisers and agencies that we bought last year, has doubled its client list in the last year, with over 5x growth outside of the U.S. Mobile Display is starting to take-off too with traffic on the AdMob network up more than 3.5x in the past year. More and more of that traffic is coming from tablets, so we launched a new set of formats designed specifically for tablets. These formats are web-based. They use HTML, and brand advertisers don't need to make different versions of their ads for different models.
Nikesh also mentioned our great momentum with YouTube, where we're getting strong performance from the YouTube skippable ads. Because users can choose to skip these in-stream ads, the people who choose to watch them are much more engaged. More and more advertisers are choosing to make their ads skippable and now, over 1/3 of in-stream ads on YouTube are in a skipable format, which is a pretty remarkable stat given that we launched this format in December.
Finally, I'd like to update our progress on Chrome. Larry mentioned how we passed 160 million users which is more than double year-on-year. This quarter, our partner Samsung and Acer Search using Phonebooks in 7 countries. Phonebook are designed to be fast, to just work, and to get better over time, thanks to our automatic updates. And they're now available through Amazon and Best Buy. Phonebooks are also available to schools and businesses via subscription model. The subscription includes Phonebooks, of course, administration, warranty, and support, starting at $20 a month. 
So overall it was a very busy quarter for us. But maybe the coolest thing we did was the Les Paul doodle we ran last month. It was a guitar you could actually play, and users recorded over 40 million songs while it was up. That's about 5 years of music. 
I'm looking forward to hearing your questions and comments. And for now, back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Susan. So Jamie, our operator, is going to help us through this. Jamie, you can just set up the call for Q&A. And as I said, we'll have Susan, Nikesh, Larry, and myself to answer any questions you may have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG
Two quick questions, if I could. First for Patrick or perhaps Nikesh, International revenue growth as you mentioned was really strong. I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on perhaps that's driving that? If you could give us a sense of how much of that is core Search versus some of the newer initiatives like Mobile, YouTube, and Display. And then the second question is for Larry. I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit, Larry, about the patent strategy. Our understanding is you guys have about 650 patents. So just given the Oracle situation, I was wondering if you could talk about the patent strategy to ensure that you guys can continue to innovate going forward.
Patrick Pichette
I'll let Nikesh answer the first part of the question, and then Larry will talk about the patent issues.
Nikesh Arora
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we've seen tremendous growth across pretty much all product areas. So the growth you're seeing in international is driven by Mobile, by Display, by Search. Clearly international is not one market there are many different countries. So we have seen different effects in different markets. Places like Japan, as I said, have been driven more by Display and Mobile. Various parts of Asia are just getting up the curve for us in Display and are strong contributors in Mobile. Having said that, Russia has been very strong for us. Brazil has been very strong for us. Brazil in the back of Mobile and Display as well, and as well as core Search. So if you think about what we're seeing, we're seeing more and more a pickup of Display and Mobile because we have established sales team are pretty much on almost every major market around the world to help sell Display. And the Mobile tick up based on tick up of smartphones and Android et cetera is helping that trend as well. In addition to that, a lot of effort has gone in to bringing small business online and that increases a number of advertisers in many international markets. As you get more advertisers in international markets. It has a very positive impact on our RPMs in those markets. So we're seeing that effect as well.
Larry Page
To your question on Android and patents and so on. Obviously we have a number of intellectual property patents in progress not just already issued. I must just say, Android's really on a tear. I mentioned there were over 550,000 new Android daily activations previously. And there's over 400 such devices, 39 OEMs, 231 carriers in 123 countries, and over 78 open handset alliance partners. And that velocity is only increasing. And of course despite the efforts of some of our competitors, there hasn't been any slowdown in any of those things. And partners and developers are continuing to expand the Android ecosystem. Of course we're really committed to Android and continued to support that platform and ecosystem, and do it in a cost effective manner.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup Inc
Two questions Larry. Could you talk about what you have maybe put in to improve the velocity of decision-making? And as you step back and think about the management improvements you could see over the next year or 2, how significant do you think -- how much better -- how much more efficiently do you think Google could be run, than what we've seen maybe over the last 2 or 3 years? And then Susan, real quickly, social search signals, how important do you think they are now? How key are they -- how much of that is Google+'s strategy for trying to make the core search results more relevant?
Larry Page
This is Larry. I'm super excited about the changes we've made and I think as companies scale, we always change how we're running the company over time. So I think we have a much more of a product focused structure now, which I'm very excited about and talked about it. And I think that maintaining and improving our velocity and execution is a really noble goal for us. And it requires always a lot of work in companies. And I think that's super important direction for us, and I'm really excited about it.
Patrick Pichette
Susan, on social?
Susan Wojcicki
Yes, so I think the first thing I would say about social is that we're very early right now. And really our focus with Google+ will be to focus on making sure that we have a wonderful consumer and user experience. From a targeting perspective, there are a number of signals that we use right now. Obviously keyword on Search, contextual, interspaced advertising, demographics, and social signals overtime can be an important part of that. But it would be one of multiple ways that we actually do targeting. When we did rollout Google+, we do have pluses on all the ads this is what we do in search results. So if the user does click on it, and someone on their circle has actually does a query and triggers that, then there will be social annotations, which will be useful information for the user to see that their friend has +1-ed that ad.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Research
Congratulations on the execution and the launch of Google+. Larry, at a high-level what, if any, are some of the key differences on how you think about managing specifically the economic model of the company today versus when Eric was CEO? Specifically any changes to target margins, revenue growth targets, et cetera? And then separately, on Mobile Search specifically, it's clearly been successful in terms of search share. But when we're trying to figure out the overall impact to net revenue in kind of balancing out some of the positives like incremental searches and share gains and higher click-through rates, but also having the headwinds of TAC payments to partners and lower CPCs, how should we think about the overall net impact of Mobile to the business?
Patrick Pichette
Why don't I'd take the second part of that question, and then Larry can talk about the economic model versus in the context of what you said. But for Mobile search, you have to go back and focus on what we focused on. Build businesses that are going to be billion-dollar businesses and that actually contribute significant operating dollar margins. These are businesses that scale to a humongous scale as they grow. So for us, that is the focus that we have. And the second piece in the specifics of Mobile is we really see Mobile a bit like Search was in 2001, 2002, 2003. All these formats are so new that you know that there's so much more room for optimization on top of it. So it is in fact a bit of a mistake to kind of say okay, today whatever we have is a good proxy for what the future will look like. And that's why we're excited about it. And that's why we focus so much on Mobile. For the economic model and how we run the company, maybe Larry, your thoughts on that?
Larry Page
Absolutely, thanks for the question. I think certainly Eric is a great partner and leader for me and for Google for the last 10 years, and continues to play a big part in the company. So I don't think there's, like we said before, there's no major changes in what we're doing. And I'll reiterate maybe a little bit and add a little detail to what I already said. I think about really in our products in 3 separate categories. First, through Search and our Ads business, which is the core driver of revenue for the company. We really invest in that, we work hard on it. Next we have businesses that are enjoying really high consumer success. For example, YouTube, Android, and Chrome. And we invest in those in order top them for long-term success. And we have some new businesses on Google+, Commerce, and Local that we're really excited about and are at pretty early stage and those things we invest in as well. And we don't do things that we don't think will generate really big returns over time. So we're optimizing for our long-term economic success. But we do have these very different buckets of things that we work on.

And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with RBC.
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets, LLC
Two questions. First on Google+ and then second on Google Offers. So on plus, we haven't seen real integration. We know it's only a couple of weeks old but with Google's kind of core competencies around search and other things that you've been very successful at in the past. So can you talk about plans on integrating some of Google's core strength into Google+ to further, I guess, differentiate the products from other services that are out there? And then on Google Offers, can you just talk about your overall strategy in terms of rolling out offers? You're in 4 cities today. How fast do you think you're going to accelerate into these newer cities, and is international territories also on the roadmap and the near-term for Offers?
Larry Page
I'll answer the first part, this is Larry. Google+ actually has a lot of interesting product integration. The black Google bar that you see is an entry point and notification point for Plus across basically all of our properties. And we're really excited about that, and think it's a big deal. Suffice to say there are many things that you would do with Plus and with +1 that affect what you would see in search results. Like I mentioned, when you +1 something, your friends will see it in search. So absolutely, and I hope it was clear that was our strategy, but we're very focused on improving all of Google, improving the sharing and identity across all of Google.
Patrick Pichette
Maybe Nikesh can give a comment on the rollout of Google Offers.
Nikesh Arora
Thanks, Patrick. We won't give out details on how we rollout our offer strategy. I think Susan said it very well in our overall strategy, because Offers for us is not just an isolated event. It is a combined, a bit of a commerce offering, which includes their Mobile phone and other things we talked about. We were very happy with the rollout we've had in the one city where we've been for a while, which is Portland, and we just rolled out 2 more cities earlier this week. So from our perspective, you can expect us to roll out other cities, but we're going to be testing and looking at the models see what's working and what's not working because we want to build the next version of how we rollout an Offers product. So stay tuned.

We'll go next to Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian Pitz - UBS Investment Bank
Two quick questions. As we note the proliferation of the newer, richer ad formats like product image ads that we're seeing more and more of on your site, can you help us better understand the impact on paid click growth specifically? And then separately, can you also give us a little more color on some of the [indiscernible] quality changes you're doing on the network? Any commentary on how much impact to growth of AdSense that had this quarter and how long should we expect to see more than expected impact from continued quality changes?
Patrick Pichette
Why don't I let, actually, Susan tackle those questions? Susan?
Susan Wojcicki
On the richer ad formats, we see a few important opportunities for us, and what we feel about them is it gives us the opportunity to make those ads better for the users. And as we can create better experiences for our users, they're more likely to have the information that a user wants. And so what we'd hope to see is a click-through increase over time. And hopefully, for the advertiser on the back end, a better conversion. So in terms of click growth, and what's actually driving the click growth that we see, it's a matter of factors. One of them is always going to be query growth that we have. Second thing would be on improvements that we have to our back end quality models. So the better the quality model is, the more likely we are to actually match the right advertisement to the right user. And we had a number of good ads, as I mentioned, not just good, we had great ads quality launches this quarter, and a number of ad formats that made the ads more readable. And by making them more readable, the users are more likely to click on them. And that turns into click growth. And then on the last question that you had, which was Panda, Panda was a change made by the search team with the goal of improving overall search experience. There was, as we talked about last time, some negative effects from the AdSense partners. However, Panda does -- or any search quality that we make, does have a change of ranking, which means that there are different sites that wind up getting traffic. And that those sites may adjust their monetization strategy over time. And so it may just take some time for that to actually balance out. And also, in terms of the last question, we don't really comment about future changes that we're going to make, but we're always thinking about the right way to continue to improve the search results for our users.
Patrick Pichette
Panda, once again a great example of putting the user first ends up benefiting everybody in the end, the publishers, the advertisers, and the users.
Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch
Larry, thanks for joining the call. And while we have you, I'm just going to ask you a question I get all the time. How focused is senior management on the stock either as an employee retention tool or a measure of management's performance over, say a 3 to 5 year period? And then secondly, if I could just ask about the local opportunity, it looks like a lot of launches happening for Google. Do you see it as a different ad market than your current search ad market? And how might your model be different than some of the larger players in that market currently?
Larry Page
We have a lot of stuff to do here at Google, and unfortunately one of the things we don't get to decide is our stock price. So you all are in charge of that. I think we're really focused on our long-term success as a business and the kind of things I mentioned already are absolute, overall profitability over the long-term and our revenue growth. And so, we tend to focus much more on that, with a much more long-term view than we do on our stock price.
Patrick Pichette
Susan, views on the difference and the similarities between the local and our traditional ads market.
Susan Wojcicki
Yes, Local can be thought about 2 different ways. Local can be the large retailers who have many different points of presence. So, for example, Starbucks or Pizza Hut or any retailer which is a large holding company or one large retailer, but then has many different local points of presence and then there's a separate bucket which are the small Joe's coffee shop example. And both of them need different things from a product perspective in order to be able to advertise more broadly. And we are working in both buckets to solve and make them advertisers on AdWords with solutions that will work for them. The large ones need functionality of how do I run a campaign in all of these different locations with different keywords, different pricing. And so we're working to enable location in our AdWords campaigns where you're managing a large account to make that much easier. The Joe's Coffee Shop example, what we're working on is enabling signing up for AdWords to be a much easier experience. So we actually have a product that we released this quarter called Google Boost. And Boost, a product is a 1 page, 5 minute sign-up for advertisers. It's very easy to sign-up. We haven't marketed it a lot right now but we have seen good success with our advertisers. And we're hoping to make that more known to our advertisers.
Patrick Pichette
The last piece in the puzzle is, obviously Susan, Mobile, which is completely integrated from an ads perspective and targeting as well.
Susan Wojcicki
Yes, the other thing too is we would like to make all of our products be accessible from a Mobile perspective. Click-to-Call would be an example. Click-to-Call is really nice so that as someone, for example, is local walking down the street, they can actually call. But it's also really nice from the small retailer perspective, because they can understand that they're getting a call and they're getting a lead, which for them would be much more tangible than actually a click to their page. So we're investing very heavily in that in terms of Click-to-Call technology and the good tracking for the local advertisers.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
Two questions. I guess first of all, you've got obviously quite a few products and applications that have had success over the years. Kind of that are out there obviously Search, Gmail, Chrome, Android et cetera. I guess as you think about next generation of consumer relationship and stickiness, how do you think about like integrating a lot of these core assets together in terms of building a consumer relationship, which kind of moves seamlessly from all these different solutions and formats out there, as well as devices? And then second, maybe around Google+, obviously it's only been 2 weeks now. But maybe can you talk about the overall trend in terms of 10 million users? How does that compare against maybe the early days of how Android or Chrome or maybe even search or mail ramped? What kind of trajectory or what kind of trend schedule does it look like right now if you were to pinpoint it against another product in the business?
Larry Page
We are -- on the integration point, we obviously have a lot of different products that do different things for different people. And we know one effort that I mentioned, I've been really excited about, is this visual redesign. And I also mentioned the bar that goes across the black bar that goes across with Google+, that gives you a notification on sharing and so on. We're definitely working hard to integrate our products better to make the user experience simpler, intuitive and beautiful and consistent. And I'm really excited about our progress just in one quarter on that and I think you'll -- we're certainly working hard on that. And we have to continue to over time. On the Plus growth question, we've been very, very excited about the growth we've seen and the engagement we've seen. Over 1 billion items shared and received in a single day. And I think that for us, there's a lot of barriers to use Plus right now. One thing, you have to be invited and so on and it's still in field trial. So I think given all that, were just extremely excited about that. But it's very early days. It's been less than 2 weeks since we released it into field trial.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
First on Local. You've got a lot of interesting services and capabilities. But they're still fairly disparate and in some instances there's some overlapping features. I'm just curious, from an end-user perspective, how are you thinking about bringing together your various local commerce products? And then maybe to follow up on the Google+ question, since it is so early, what are your longer-term goals for Plus? I mean measured by their users or number of items shared. How are you thinking about this over say, a 2 year timeframe?
Larry Page
I'll take the second question first, on the Plus, how would we think about success of it. I think we are really, obviously, like I said we want people to make products that everybody uses 2x a day, like their toothbrush. We'd certainly think about plus that way, and also just generally having really great sharing experience and identity experience across Google and all of its products. And so that's kind of how we think about the success there I think it's pretty straightforward. On the first question, integration? Patrick, do you want to take that?
Patrick Pichette
Let me say just that what's been really cool about local for us, in the addition to what Susan has mentioned a few minutes ago is, you have to think of it as we are in fact assembling all the pieces of the puzzle. Local is actually a quite complex experience, but when you have Maps, you have Mobile, you have Wallet, you have all the ads serving, you basically have the pieces of the puzzle to succeed, and it's not as much what was yesterday's tools that we had, and how do we evolve only yesterday's tools, it's about taking those pieces of the puzzle and really creating true innovative services. And that's how we have to think about local. And that's why it's not obvious. But if you look at the arsenal we're building, it's actually quite formidable. So that's why we're excited by that. Thanks Jason for your question.
Operator
And we'll go next to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co
I wanted to ask 2 things. First, Patrick, can you give us some color on the mix as headcount additions? And in particular, if you look at R&D it looks like it was flat sequentially, but yet you added more than 2,000 people during the quarter. So I'm hoping you can provide some color there. And then secondly can you give us some context just in terms of how you think about the Display business and whether you need more O and O inventory.
Patrick Pichette
I'll answer the first one, and then I'll let Susan answer the second. On headcount, again, as we said on the call, roughly, we have IT for 450 so roughly about 2000 for the quarter, and Larry comment on that. And we -- there's still a huge amount of engineers in that. It just happens that R&D is actually in every line item. So you'll find in many other areas of our P&L. And so you should not worry. We have a complete focus to make sure that we actually have a majority of our hiring that is focused on Engineering, which is really the core of the business and then we continue to kind of -- then you have the mix of sales and then just general overhead. It's really engineering and sales that have been the focus in that sequence. For Display, I'll let Susan talk about it.
Larry Page
I'll just add too in the headcount question. None of the focus there has changed substantially from our past.
Susan Wojcicki
On Display, our biggest O and O property is obviously YouTube. And given the numbers that we saw, we've seen tremendous growth there and a huge opportunity to monetize video as more users come online, and more content lines are being uploaded on YouTube. But the strategy, and our Display strategy overall is dependent not just on O and O. It also has many other components. The first of being to be a platform to enable advertisers and publishers to much more easily buy and sell Display advertising. And then second, to enable all of the sites out there, of which there are of course many, many millions, hundreds of millions of them, for them to be able to monetize and sell display advertising and for us to be able to help them as part of that process and via our network, where we have a lot of different targeting techniques to try to serve the right ad to those users. So really our strategy is part O and O with our sites like YouTube, but then also to continue to build a great network and platform products to that advertisers and publishers across the industry can serve Display advertising.
Operator
And we'll go next to the line of Anthony DiClemente from Barclay's Capital.
Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital
I have one for Patrick and one for Larry. Patrick if you just isolate the 6% sequential growth in cost-per-click versus last quarter, wondering if you could help us understand the driver of that acceleration, and moving forward, should we expect that to continue or moderate, given that as Mobile queries start to take up more of the query mix? And then question for Larry, it would appear that in social media that switching costs for users are high perhaps years of photos on a social network platform. And as you look at Google+ and the growth there, what are the most compelling offsets to those switching costs you think or do you perhaps see a future where folks can simultaneously be a part of multiple social networking platforms?
Patrick Pichette
So why don't I let Susan actually give you a bit of color on our CPC and evolution, and then Larry will take on the latter, the social one.
Susan Wojcicki
The drivers of CPC, there are few of them. One of them in this quarter was FX, certainly. But we've been really focused on our ads quality improvements, and how do we continue to obviously make our ads better for our users and for our advertisers. And in doing so, we've actually -- we done a lot of optimization of our ads that appear above the search results like site links, some of the ad changes in the formats that we made this quarter, and a lot of the ads that appear above the top search results tend to be higher CPC because they're the first 3 ads. So as we continue to optimize and really drive a lot of the increased click-through and visibility for the ads that appear above the search results, you will see -- since those tend to be higher CPC because they're at the top of the results, you will see some of that increasing.
Patrick Pichette
Larry on sell-through and switching costs?
Larry Page
I think we've been really excited about Google+ really improving the overall social experience and making it more like how you would share in real-life. And that's really a different product than is out there now. And we're getting just rave reviews for that. People really like being able to share with more discrete groups in an easy way, intuitive way, and there's a lot of magic built into the product that causes that. And as you say, you asked about the photos, we actually have a really great photo experience on the Android. Like if you take a picture on Android and you have Google+ client, which you would have, if you're using it. It uploads your photos automatically, and it's super easy to share them and post-them to your friends, or your family or whatever. It's a really, really great experience. So there is legacy in Google, as a company, believes in users owning their own data and being able to easily move it out of Google. As some of our competitors don't believe in that. We think the users will eventually move to services that are in their best interest and that work really well for them.
Operator
We'll take our final question from Jim Friedland with Cowen and Company.
James Friedland - Cowen and Company, LLC
I wanted to ask a question on -- or follow-up on where you guys said that you're a little ahead of where you expected to be on hiring. Should we think about the hiring and particularly in R&D sort of coming in waves where you hire a bunch of people, get them integrated, it sort of slows down and picks up again? And then the second question and just on the P&L, other cost surviving users of percentage of [indiscernible] TAC seems to be a little high. Is that coming from increased Data Center depreciation or is it may be coming from YouTube and content related costs?
Patrick Pichette
I'll answer the first one, the latter one, and then I'll let Larry talk about hiring in general. The P&L, yes, it is a combination of factors this quarter. So in that cost is also included headcount. And so headcount is actually increased. Power is increased because of seasonality. It's summer now, so our power is a little higher. And we've also had kind of catch up on expenses on some of the equipment. So there's been a bit of a between Q1 and Q2, there's been a bit of a cleanup in some of the areas of equipment that have actually slightly deflated Q1 and inflated Q2 as we finish the clean up, so that was a bit of a catch up there. So I wouldn't read the data point between Q1 and Q2. Don't create a graph with that, with that line. But it's a bit of everything, including a bit of cleanup and some of the equipment accounts. For the issue of hiring, I'll let Larry actually talk about general where we stand right now.
Larry Page
That's a great question. I think just a couple of factors that affected that and I think you know we implemented compensation changes in Q1. We increased our employee compensation. And they've had even more positive effect on hiring and retention than when we expected. It's been a super successful change. And I think in general this has more excited people who want to work at Google and who want to stay working at Google than we expected. And so that's had some impact on those numbers. Of course there's a limit on how many we can -- and how fast we can productively hire, and I said this in my remark, I think kind of my judgments where at the edge of that piece being reasonable. We're just adding a lot of people. And I'd say that we're always looking for good people, and we're always -- the exact rate is going to depend on success and where we really want to invest in the company. We have a really strong management team. I said that's working together fabulously, and we can absorb those hires and put them to use well. But like I said, we're definitely -- we're surprised that the success of our previous changes around compensation as well.
Patrick Pichette
With that, I just want to thank Larry for joining us today, and Nikesh, and Susan for the comments as well as the Q&A. I want to thank, once again as I always do, all the Googlers out there. Our fantastic Googlers that have made this quarter possible. And all of the innovation, especially I think it's worth mentioning, our Google+ team that has done a phenomenal job in this launch. So 2 thumbs up. 
So on behalf of all of us here, congratulations and many thanks to all of our gang at Google. With that, I'll let you, Jamie, close the call. And thank you, everybody, for participating today.

Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Google Inc. First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Jane Penner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Jane Penner
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Susan Wojcicki, Senior Vice President, Advertising; Jeff Huber, Senior Vice President, Commerce and Local; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.
First, Patrick, Susan and Jeff will provide us with their thoughts on the quarter, after which Nikesh will join the group to answer your questions. Also, as you know, we now distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings release, as well as supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours.
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding Google's future and investments in our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.

Please note that certain financial measures which we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are all also expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon, everybody. We just happen to have a surprise visit. Larry is joining us for a few minutes at the beginning of the call and wanted to make a few comments. So before we start officially our call, I just want to welcome Larry. Welcome, Larry.
Larry Page
Thank you, Patrick. It's great to take just a few minutes with all of you. We've had a tremendous quarter, 27% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. And we're really excited about that, and I think it shows the strength of our business and our continuing -- and the continuing growth really in the tech industry. And it's really still at the beginning from a user perspective. There's tremendous improvements to be had in our core products and our core business, and we're really excited about that.
I also wanted to mention a little bit about the management changes. Everything we told you last quarter has happened as we expected. It's all working very well, exactly as we planned. I'll just reiterate that quickly. I'm managing the day-to-day operations of Google as the CEO, working very closely with my team, and I'm really excited about the progress we've had there. I think we really hit the ground running. And Eric, of course, is focused externally, on the government partnerships, government relations and partnership outreaches. And last quarter alone, he was in Germany and Brazil, Argentina and Spain and has been just doing tremendous things for the company.  Sergey, as we mentioned, is working very intensively on a few emerging projects for us. As I said, this was all exactly as we planned, and I'm very, very excited about those changes. I'd also mention we've made a number of changes to just simplify our organ, improve our velocity and execution and basically, simplify our reporting structures and such. 
Now I'm very excited about Google and our momentum and very, very optimistic about our future. I also just wanted to mention we have Jonathan Rosenberg, who's usually done this call, is transitioning out of the company as was announced a while ago. And I really wanted to thank him for all of his insights and hard work and fine communication with all of you. And so we'll clearly miss him, and we really wanted to thank him from the bottom of our hearts. 
So those are the main things I wanted to say. I'm tremendously excited about all of the things that lay before us as a company. And I also want to say you're in very good hands with the team here, and Patrick who now should take the call away.
Patrick Pichette
Great. Thank you, Larry. Thank you for taking a few minutes in the schedule to just drop in. So what we'll do now is we are back. So we found a phone for the last 30 seconds, and we're going to be back now with the rest of the team to go back to our regular call.
So as an overview, I'll be giving you the regular speech. Susan and Jeff will give you color comments as well in the product area, as well as the monetization side. And Nikesh is with us so that when we go through Q&A, he'll be answer to give you a lot more color commentary in some areas. 
Look, we're nothing but very, very excited about our reporting 27% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. This 27% proves really the logic behind our strategy, not only to invest heavily in our core Search business and Ads but also in our new emerging businesses like Display, like Mobile, like Enterprise. From an investment perspective, our Q1 results don't only show our continued commitment to invest in hiring, in marketing and in the other areas, but they also -- as you can see through our expenses, they reflect, for the first time, the full impact of the compensation changes we announced in Q4, the 10% salary increase. Google is clearly benefiting from and is also fueling the unrelenting pace of the digital economy that's around us. And it's growth that we believe will benefit both Google but in fact, the entire ecosystem for a long time to come.
So let's turn to the specifics of our performance for the quarter. Gross revenue, as we mentioned already, 27% to $8.6 billion and interestingly, 2% quarter-over-quarter. To put this in context, this is quite remarkable if you think that Q4 was an amazingly strong quarter. And in fact, it adds also the impact of the Nexus One from Q1 of last year and to a lesser extent, the events that have occurred in Japan. 
So Google website's revenue was up 32% year-over-year, $5.9 billion, with strength across all major geographies and verticals. The Google Network revenue was up 19% year-over-year to $2.4 billion. That Network revenue was negatively impacted by two things, the loss of a Search distribution partnership deal and also, what has been broadly communicated, by Search quality improvement made during the quarter. Regarding the Search quality improvement, remember that we regularly make such trade-offs. We really believe that the quality improvements that benefit the user always serves us well both in the short term and in the mid term in terms of revenue. So Jeff will cover that in more detail in the coming minutes. Other revenue was down 10% year-over-year to $269 million. And note that in Q1 of 2010 was the first quarter that we'd booked Nexus One revenues, and this is what drives the year-over-year decline.
Global aggregate paid click gross -- that's my tongue twister for every quarter. It was very strong again, up 18% year-over-year, interestingly, 4% up also quarter-over-quarter and again, reflecting the accelerated shift of off-line to online. Aggregate cost-per-click growth was also quite healthy, up 8% and only 1% down quarter-over-quarter. And you should all know that the FX had a pretty neutral effect on CPC growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Remember too that that's an aggregate number and includes both google.com and our AdSense properties. 
So now turning to our geographic performance, the U.S. and the rest of world are both growing at a very healthy pace, and our results reflect that. The U.K. continues to lag a bit because of its global economic recovery, the pace of its -- the recovery.  Revenue from the U.S. was up 25% year-over-year to $4 billion. In our earnings slides you can find on our Investor Relations website, you will see that we have broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefit of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
International revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue or $4.6 billion, and it was up 28% year-over-year. It includes a $14 million benefit from our hedging program, and that compares to a $10 million benefit of Q1 of last year. If we use a fixed exchange rate, our international revenue would have been roughly $23 million lower year-over-year. Also, it's worth noting that the tragedy in Japan somewhat negatively impacted our international revenue in Q1. And as I mentioned earlier, the U.K. was up 15% year-over-year to $969 million as the country continues to experience struggling economy. But even that 15% is really 17% in FX adjusted basis.
Let me turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $2.0 billion or 25% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue, $897 million, including stock-based compensation of $49 million. And finally, all operating expenses totaled $2.8 billion, including approximately $383 million in stock-based compensation. The increase year-over-year in OpEx, primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and promotional spend and some other professional services. So a result of all these expenses, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes the stock-based compensation, was $3.2 billion in Q1 of this year, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 37.6%. Headcount was up approximately 1,900 people from Q4, ending the quarter with 26,316 full-time employees. Our effective tax rate was 21% roughly. The exact number is 20.5%. 
Let we now turn to cash management. Our other income and expenses was $96 million for Q1, in fact, a very solid performance from our portfolio management. And unfortunately, just masked by the impact of our higher hedging expenses associated with our SFAS 133, the accounting of which we know is quite volatile from quarter to quarter. So for more details on OI&E, please again refer to the slides that accompany our call on our IR site. 
Operating cash flow, very strong, $3.2 billion. CapEx for the quarter, $890 million, significantly below last quarter of $2.5 billion. And remember that last quarter, that increase was largely due to our purchase of the New York City office. Majority of CapEx spend in Q1 was related to facilities, expenses and data center operations. In the facility space, we spent -- was really driven by the purchase of two buildings, one in Dublin and one in Paris. Just as a reminder, we continue to make significant CapEx investments, and we've shown those to be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on when we're able to make such investments. Obviously, we're pleased with our free cash flow, which was $2.3 billion for the quarter.
As I said earlier, our accelerating growth trajectory, it really shows our confidence to expand across products and geographies. Roughly 18 months ago, we began communicating how we were really optimistic about our opportunities, and we had the business confidence to invest heavily in the next phase of innovation and revenue generation. Well, our product innovation over the last 18 months has been nothing short but extraordinary. Let's take a look at this. 
We have built from scratch the world's most popular smartphone operating system. We've built also from scratch the world's fastest growing browser. And in some countries like India, one in four people are now accessing the web via Chrome. We've reinvented display advertising, creating not only a business but an entire ecosystem with a $2.5 billion annual run rate as of Q3 of last year. We've pushed the frontier of mobile search, creating a whole new search segment that is adding to our overall search volume and brand new monetization opportunities. We've seen YouTube develop into a platform, a win-win platform in fact, where partners can generate significant revenue from their content and users watch 2 billion views a day.
And our revenue growth clearly shows the wisdom of those decisions to fuel our growth ahead of the curve. So the facts speak [ph] from the sales really. The second half of 2010, we grew roughly 25% year-over-year. But even more telling, this quarter, growth rate of 27% compared to a comp of 23% just a year ago. We are building multibillion dollar businesses, and we're confident that now is the time to invest. It's with this optimism that we'll continue to do so aggressively but with discipline, with strong focus on fueling the winning products. From an expense point of view, we're taking some bold steps but always with good strategic rationale in mind and discipline in mind. 
So as our Q1 results continue to reflect some marketing -- you've heard of our marketing going up. It's a very deliberate choice as an example. We have laid, made very specific focus on Chrome, customer and advertiser acquisition in the U.S. and international markets. And in both cases, we're seeing the fruits of these investments. The same is true for our labor strategy. And finally, we continue to invest in our long-term infrastructure. 
So now let me turn it over to Jeff and Susan to provide you more details on the products that are the engine of both our growth and our optimism. They'll also provide you more details on where we're deploying some of these additional resources as they're coming on board. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Huber
Thanks, Patrick, and hi, everyone. In his comments, Patrick mentioned our ambitious hiring this quarter, which was by design. We announced in January, with a blog post to help energize recruiting, that 2011 will be the biggest hiring year in our history, topping the 6,000 people we hired in 2007. And we ended up hiring 1,900 people this quarter. We're very happy about this, because we feel this is a very good time to invest. We look at the factors like our revenue growth and how well our core and growing businesses are doing and say to ourselves, ""Who wouldn't want to invest in this business?"" So that's what we're doing, hiring great people to invest in the future. In fact, over half the Newglers who joined this quarter are going to be working in high potential and revenue growth areas like YouTube, Mobile, Chrome, commerce and local and Enterprise. 
So that's what Susan and I are going to talk about today. We'll give you an update on our core business of Search and Ads, as well as these businesses where we're investing. Susan will cover our Ads products, Search Ads, Mobile Ads, local Ads, Display Ads and YouTube, and I'll talk about Search, Android, Chrome and Enterprise. 
So let's jump in with Search. Search is the most important thing people do online, and there's loads of opportunities to make Search more intelligent and more personal. Intelligent, as in better quality. Our primary focus is to always create the best user experience. So this quarter, we launched over 90 different quality improvements. Most notably, we made an important change to our ranking algorithms to promote higher-quality sites. This noticeably impacted about 12% of our -- of all queries, and it's done a good job. We found it addressed over 80% of the sites that users reported as a poor experience via a Chrome feature we introduced a while ago. This change did have an adverse impact on revenues for some sites in our Display Network, but we've continually found improving Search results and our users' experience is always the best thing to do in the long run and for long-term value.
Personal, as in building around people. We improved social search this quarter, making it easier to find information and recommendations from the people that matter to you, whether they're publishing on YouTube or Flickr or their own blog or website. We also launched the +1 button, which makes it easy to share recommendations with the world via Google Search results. And this is just the beginning. We've got lots more useful and relevant social search features coming soon.
A lot more of our searches are coming from mobile devices. This traffic has gone up more than 500% in the last two years. Android is obviously a big driver of this. We're activating over 350,000 Android devices every day. Android market is taking off too, over 3 billion apps have been installed, up 50% in just the last quarter. You can now access the market online. Try it at market.android.com so you can shop and browse for apps from your computer, click the purchase, and they just magically show up in your device. We also recently launched In-app Billing, which has been very enthusiastically received and which gives developers more ways to make money from their hard work.
Another product and it's doing very well is Chrome. Chrome users are very valuable to Google. And as we've said in past quarters, we're investing in Chrome marketing. The payoff is worth it. We have over 120 million daily users, over 40% of whom we added in the past year as a result of our marketing efforts. The Chrome OS program is also going well, and we look forward to launching devices with our partners later this year. 
Our Enterprise business is growing across both businesses and schools. As example, this quarter, we deployed Google Apps at InterContinental Hotel Groups and RR Donnelley; signed a reseller agreement with Optus, which is the largest -- second largest telco in Australia; and signed up the University of Texas and Boston University. We were pleased that our deal with ITA Software was approved by the DOJ last week and closed this week. Travel searches in the area with lots of potential for innovation, both for end users and as a platform for the industry. We're looking forward to bringing the ITA team on board and doing great things together.
That wraps up my remarks. But before I turn it over to Susan, I just want to take a moment to thank Jonathan Rosenberg, who has been a regular on these calls, for all he's done for Google. Jonathan and I have been friends and colleagues for over 15 years. And on behalf of myself and Susan, who also worked closely with Jonathan for the last nine years, I can assure all of you that he will be missed. Over to you, Susan.
Susan Wojcicki
Thank you, Jeff. Hi, everyone. So there are a lot of things to be excited about in our Ads business, and I'd like to share a few updates from the quarter in Search, Display and Mobile Ads. 
Search is still our core business. And even though it's a really large business, we see a significant opportunity for growth, as Larry mentioned. One of the things that we've been focusing on is thinking about how we can serve the most perfect ad for every query. A query for a product will require a very different kind of ad than a query about a movie. And in order to do this, we are enabling new creative types and new ways for advertisers to set up their campaigns.
One example of this is Product Listing Ads, which we released to U.S. advertisers in Q4. If you're a retailer and have hundreds of thousands of SKUs, it's hard to set up the separate creative for each one of those. So product listing ads automatically creates ads from product feeds rather than from keywords. Then a retailer can run a unique ad for every product without doing any extra work. We're seeing great advertiser adoption, and about half of the largest retailers in the U.S. are now running these ads.
If you do a search for soccer cleats, something I'm thinking about buying for my daughter, you can see some of these on the right-hand side. The ads include pictures and prices. That's something you'd want to see if you're going to buy something. The ads are really effective too. They're about twice the click-through of standard text ads in the same location. 
This quarter, we also launched a much richer ad format for more brand-focused advertisers, and we're calling this format Media Ads, because we're starting with the movie and entertainment advertisers, but we think this format will work for all types of brand advertisers on Search as well. These creatives can include images or videos, and in the case of the movie studios, it will include a movie trailer. Again, there are no keywords, and Google figures out the right queries to serve the ad. To see one of these ads, try searching for the movie Water for Elephants. If you are searching for a movie and the movie -- and you wind up seeing the movie trailer in the ad, we're getting you a lot closer to seeing the perfect ad. So as you can see, there's a lot of opportunity for more innovation within Search Ads.
I'd like to move on to Display right now. I'm very proud of how well our Display business has been growing. We bought DoubleClick three years ago. We've done a lot of integration together. And as a result, we've seen a lot of progress. Our Google Display Network is up 5x since acquisition, and we've been doubling annually in several of our key markets, like the U.K., Brazil and Japan. 
Now most Display advertisers can be bucketed in one of two categories. They can think about themselves as being performance oriented, where they value conversions and clicks or more brand oriented, where they're focused on raising awareness. Last quarter, we started to develop some features for brand advertisers. We had launched Google Display Network reserve, which gives advertisers ability to buy premium inventory on a guaranteed basis, which is how brand advertisers are telling us they want to buy the inventory. We are also giving advertisers tools that help them measure the impact of their campaigns on things like brand lift rather than just clicks and conversions.
Our Ad Exchange, which we've been focused on building a unified buying platform so that advertisers and agencies can buy the exact audiences they want across the Internet. The transaction volume on the Ad Exchange has tripled in the past year, and 2/3 of that inventory is being bought via real-time bidding, which is a new technology to enable much more programmatic and scientific ad buying. It also results in better ads for users and gets us closer again to serving the more perfect ad. 
YouTube is another part of our Display strategy. Revenue is doubling year-over-year, and we share that revenue with over 20,000 content partners. We're starting to see a virtuous cycle. The more money we make for our content partners, the more engaging content they upload. So as you can see, there's been a lot of nice progress in Display due to the results of a lot of people at Google.
Moving on to Mobile, we're seeing growth this year really taking off. AdMob, the display network that we acquired last year, has over 150 million iOS and Android devices making requests per month. That's up 50% in the past four months, which gives you an idea of how fast Mobile Display advertising is growing. 
Many of our advertisers are starting to run mobile-only campaigns as opposed to bundling it with their desktop campaigns. It enables advertisers to move to much more customized mobile experiences. They'll have mobile landing pages and campaigns that can incorporate location. For example, how far away is the advertiser from where you are standing right now? These custom-made stations, again, get us to the perfect ad on Mobile, since users also want to have location, or they want to have phone number. We're also seeing Click-to-Call taking off with more than half a million advertisers using these features.  As a result, the mobile-only campaigns are seeing an increase of 11.5% when they run a mobile-only campaign as opposed to a bundled mobile-desktop.
So these are just a few of the examples and the opportunity that we see in Mobile. And this overview is just a few and a small set of the many, many projects that we are investing in across that. Now back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Susan. Thank you, Susan and Jeff for this comprehensive look at what's going on our core -- across our core products. What I suggest we do now is we turn it back to Jay to give us the instructions on how to get to the Q&A and just jump in right into the Q&A, if you don't mind.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Spencer Wang with Crédit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG
So question on spending for Patrick. I think OpEx, excluding tax, was up something like 45% year-over-year. So is this the type of spending that you think will be required to sustain a high-20% revenue growth going forward? Or is this more reflective of near-term investment to support some of the growth initiative you've talked about and spending tapers off at some point in the future?
Patrick Pichette
But there is clearly the effect of the one-time salary change for this quarter that is flowing through. And in fact, in the increase in salaries, what you have is a triple effect this quarter specifically, right? Everybody at Google got a 10% salary increase. In addition to that, because it's the beginning of the year, the salary increases flow through to many of the benefits, like the 401(k)s and the vacation accruals. So many of the resets that are done in the first quarter are disproportionate in additional kind of flow-through costs. And then finally, we have new Googlers. And the Newglers, I think Jeff made a really good compelling case to explain why we're hiring them and then how we distribute them. So on the labor side, you clearly have a one-time step change, but after that, we're going to continue to be in our regular momentum. In other areas, if I take marketing, for example, marketing has increased through last year, because we see the great returns. And so for marketing, specifically, we continue to -- we don't expect to slow down our marketing, because it is proving such a kind of attractive set of returns both for customer acquisition and for key, key products, like Chrome. So for those, we're actually going to continue our momentum on them. In many areas of the company, we continue to be -- in like most areas, continue to be incredibly disciplined. People have to show up every 90 days to complete a OCQ process, where we do quarterly reviews to get your next chance [ph] for funding. I mean, the discipline of the company has not changed. We're just really bullish on our prospects.

We'll go next to James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
If I could follow-up with a couple of questions around expenses. And I'll say, we're having some issues downloading the presentation slides, so it'd be great if you could repost them at some point. But first of all, Patrick, you mentioned in your discussion of OpEx there were some other professional expenses in the first quarter. Was that a reference to legal costs or other things? And then secondly, when we look at the substantial marketing spending around Chrome, is that like a short-term campaign or more of a forever wall? And could you talk about what are the strategic benefits to Google of consumers adopting the Chrome browser?
Patrick Pichette
Okay. So let me start with just the professional services and then I'll let Nikesh give you a context of Chrome as well. So for OpEx, it's a number of areas. We're pushing -- right now, we're pushing hard on a few areas including the GEO product, where we're doing a lot of the mapping worldwide. So at the beginning of the year, we just kind of ramped up a number in there. We also have a couple of other areas. We do have slightly more legal expense as well. But also, real estate is the third component, where because of the Googlers coming on board, we just need more services to support those Googlers. So that's the highest level answer for professional services. And for Chrome, if -- let me give you just a 10-second umbrella and then I'll let Nikesh give you more color commentary. There's really a two story on Chrome. And there's a tactical question, and there's a strategic question. Chrome is really pushing the web, and it has a fantastic opportunity that when people have adopted Chrome, right, they basically -- instead of looking for Google and looking for Search, the Omnibox gives them immediate access to Google Searches. So from a strategic perspective, it has that in Chrome OS. And a tactical basis, right, everybody that uses Chrome, right, is a guaranteed locked in user for us in terms of having access to Google. So maybe, Nikesh, if you have more additional comments on the performance of the marketing.
Nikesh Arora
Thanks, Patrick. Just to add to that, I think as Jeff mentioned we have over 120 million daily users, and 40% of them were added in the past year as a result of our marketing efforts. So we've seen the 30% growth quarter-over-quarter in our Chrome usage. So I think from all perspectives, the Chrome strategy is working. And the way we distribute Chrome is people get it organically. Or they get it based on our marketing efforts. Or they see our marketing, and they choose to download it. Or we work with partners who help us promote Chrome to our users and to other users. So in that context, we found that marketing very often ends up with an equivalent or better ROI than us having to go do partnership deals. Sometimes you'll see that our tax and our marketing around Chrome is fungible, where we spend money in marketing we take away from tax as it relates to Chrome. So you can expect us to continue to drive Chrome strategically, because it has not just a Chrome-specific benefit for us, but it also impacts many of our other products that work as part of Chrome. So the lifetime value of a Chrome user is phenomenal.

We'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Research
I was wondering if you could give us, from a high level, the view of how Larry views this company differently today, or how we should view it differently given Larry's position. Is it going to change in any meaningful way?
Patrick Pichette
In short, look, I think that the company's position has not changed. Google is a technology company focused on users and looking for products that can affect billions of people. So the very first lens that you have to think through when you think of Google is are we developing computer science helping finding answers to problems where billions of people can be served. If you think that way, right, Chrome makes sense. Android makes sense. Search makes sense. All these things are the fundamentals of the company. From there, there's very clear that -- again, to paraphrase an old saying of ours, right, the 70/20/10 is very much alive and well. Search is the next billion-dollar business. Never forget it. Every quarter you've heard this time, right? 90% kind of improvement on one side 40% on the other. And like, that's one a day, right? That's a lot of engineering work to keep ahead of the -- but these are the next billion-dollar businesses. It's in its infancy and so are two or three other of our key products, which include Mobile, Display, Enterprise. So -- and then the 10%, well, it's commerce, right? It's local that we all know is nascent. It's social that we know also is nascent. And so the strategy the company is continuing to be in the same core lenses, building same products that serve billions of people and to make multibillion-dollar businesses in the waist up.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Research
Sure. If I could just follow-up briefly. I was really trying to get more at the financial model of the company, if there's any meaningful difference now that Larry is in this different position. Do you and does he think about the financial model in a different way than we had previously?
Patrick Pichette
No. Build great products and then same financial discipline.
Operator
We'll go next to Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets, LLC
Yes. I hate to beat the dead horse on the operating expense, but just one more follow-up question on that. You guys have stated that a lot of the operating expense uptick has been related to customer acquisition in Chrome, and I know there's some salespeople that have been added to the platform. But if you were making these investments, do you feel that your high-20% year-on-year growth rate would be achievable? Or do you think these OpEx additions are going to be additive in future periods kind of four, six, eight quarters down the road?
Patrick Pichette
I think that you have to look at the strategy. You have to take a look at the strategy in the context of the last four or five quarters, right? Have increased in OpEx, but when you look at our trajectory of revenue growth, right, going from 23% to 24% to 25% to 27% this quarter, we are really funding and accelerating with discipline our revenue growth. That is the fundamental. If we don't see a great ROI, you won't see us spending the money. We just happen to have great opportunities to fuel. Why not carpe diem now? It's there to take. That's really the mindset we put at it.
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets, LLC
And just one other follow-up on that. So the IV came out and said that the display marketplace in the U.S. is around $10 billion. So if we double that and say global display is $20 billion, you guys would be a little bit north of 10% on a run rate basis of the global display. How big can that business be? And can you talk about as Display becomes a bigger percentage of total revenue, what that has -- what impact that has on your overall operating margin just from that mix shift basis?
Patrick Pichette
Okay, so let me start with the latter and then I'll let Nikesh talk about the former. Clearly, Search is a unique product that has very, very high margin, right? Because Display is more complex -- there's more paperwork involved even today with Display. It's a somewhat lower margin. It's still a great margin product, and it's a product that because of the -- it's still a very good margin product. And so all those dollars I want from an operating margin point of view. So there is no way we would let that -- and there's a great symbiotic relationship between Display. As take Susan's example, right? What was a pure Display Ad before is now embedded in Search. So the symbiotic relationship is very important as well. As to the total size of the market, I'll let Nikesh give you some color commentary.
Nikesh Arora
Thanks, Patrick. I think it's important to look at the advertising market for Display in the context of the overall advertising market, which is a $600 billion to $700 billion market globally. And you can go back and say five years ago that Display was sort of stalled around $15 billion to $16 billion as the market, because we didn't have video in the mix. Now with video, everything changes. We have been recently doing some campaign in the U.K., where we tried to do some efficiency, YouTube versus television. And we found YouTube helps people reach 20% to 24% more consumers in a target segment. And you can do that in a dispersed manner. You don't have to buy one ad, which 20 million people look at. You can do that on a literally user by user basis. So you are seeing the efficiency of the web applied to video, which is going to change the way the entire display market functions. And all of our efforts in the last two or three years have been towards targeting that market, whether it's all our acquisition in the technology side, whether it's all of our efforts in trying to create a multiproduct sales force across 50 different countries around the world.  We are getting ourselves to be able to sell Display with special emphasis on rich media and video, which is going to help us sort of make that a relevant space in Google. As far as -- Patrick answered the margin question. But from my perspective, I'm told that every profitable dollar or revenue is good.
Operator
We'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch
Could we talk about Google's access to social data? Obviously, you're not running a major social network in some geographies. What's your experience there? And do you think having access to social data is going to be important for having the best query results on the web when you look out three to five years?
Jeffrey Huber
This is Jeff. We do see social as very important. Google uses well over 200 signals in terms of how we think about ranking today. And when we think about identity and relationships, those are our key signals that can and should be integrated in the experience. So it is important, but it's one of the many that we use. In terms of assets that apply to that, we do have a very, very large number of users coming to our door every day. A considerable percentage of them are logged-in users that are using multiple of our products. So there is a large variety of signals that we'll be able to use with user support and users seeing value from it to make the overall experience better.
Patrick Pichette
I think it's worth -- just in closing, you've all heard of the launch of +1 a couple of days ago or a couple of weeks ago. And it's, again, a commitment from us to get every signal we can to give the best answer for the users. So you should expect continued focus on social as one of the 200 signals and just get this rich as possible of an answer across the board.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch
Patrick, if I could do a follow-up. Does Chrome give you any signals that you can use and integrate into your Search results?
Patrick Pichette
Maybe Jeff would know the better answer of that, if Chrome gives us additional signals on social or other types of signals.
Jeffrey Huber
So Chrome we think will be part of the story over time. Chrome does have features where it is personalized today. And for example, the Chrome experience, you can essentially sign into Chrome, and it will synchronize all of your information across different instances across different computers. So that is information that, again, with user engagement and users seeing value from it, that could be useful.
Operator
We'll go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup Inc
Two questions. First, Patrick, you talked about taking bold steps to address expenses. It's just not obvious in the P&L results. So can you give us any examples of what those bold steps are? And then secondly, I know you're talking about social being one of several hundred signals, but is there any way to indicate that -- evidence you've seen so far that indicates that it's materially greater than those other variables or just as important but no more important than the other variables?
Patrick Pichette
Okay. So one -- on the issue of expenses, what you see is the ramp-up on one side, but I can guarantee you, because we have gone through the planning process for this year, that everybody that has a cost center has to demonstrate productivity. So in the case of data centers, there's productivity requirements that are actually incredibly steep. In the case of the sales force, Nikesh could give you kind of a great set of examples that his productivity, right? Is kind of -- think of it as, in his case, cost per revenue dollar. In the case of [indiscernible] (43:00), it's cost per bps and cost of storage. In the case of all staff functions, whether it be in legal, whether it be in real estate, whether it be in cost of food, whether it be cost of transportation, every one of them are expected to have a productivity curve. So in this fast-growing business -- like Google is growing, like, from a base of revenue of roughly $8 billion, 25% year-over-year. That's $2 billion of revenue. And so from that perspective, you have a tide coming with it. But under that tide, I can tell you every element of the company is scrubbed and scrutinized. So I would -- I just want to give comfort to our shareholders that there is these quarterly review processes. And these annual unit cost continue to kind of haunt many of my managers that when they come to my office. On the signaling portion of it, Jeff probably can give more color commentary about social versus others.
Jeffrey Huber
So as mentioned, it is one of the signals among many that we have. We are very optimistic that we'll be able to do great things with better social signals over time. At this point, it's a little early to tell, but we regularly measure and tune. So we'll be looking forward to that as the experiments continue.
Patrick Pichette
I know that for our shareholders and many analysts on the call, it is top of mind for people, when we grow our expenses in the way we have, to ask that question. So Mark, I just want to thank you, because it lays -- it gave me the opportunity to lay the ground clear on these issues.

Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian Pitz - UBS Investment Bank
Could you provide any color on the impacts to the user experience from the recent Panda changes? Has it impacted click-throughs or CPCs on the paid ad side? And then in terms of the overall online display industry, would you differentiate between drivers? Do you think more impactful ad units are driving growth? Or is it more complex data and algorithms and more granular targeting?
Jeffrey Huber
I'll start with the experience of the changes that we've made to improve overall quality and promote high-quality sites. I had mentioned in my comments that on the order of 12% of queries, we're positively affected in our view. And that's in terms of our changes that is a pretty significant change that has that scope. And we felt very good or confident in it, because we were able to measure against the feedback loop that we had of user-reported sites that they found that weren't as great of an experience. Just to confirm, it was web search only, not ads. It didn't have any material measurable impact in search ads in either CPC or CTR. We did mention that there was some effect on the display network of sites that were essentially the receivers of some of those clicks previously, but our focus is, again, overall on the user experience, the best possible user experience and long-term value. I'll turn it over to Susan on the balance of the questions around the Display Network.
Patrick Pichette
Can you, Brian, give us -- repeat the question for the second piece?
Brian Pitz - UBS Investment Bank
Yes. The second piece was in terms of overall online display industry, would you guys differentiate between -- do you think more impactful ad units will be driving growth? Or is it more complex data, more complex algorithms and more granular targeting?
Susan Wojcicki
Sure. So this is Susan. I'm happy to answer that one. I think in Display -- I mean, what I see happening right now with Display is that we're really at a point where there's ability to buy audiences and to do much more specific targeting than there ever was in the past. We also have much better tools in order to do that and better formats. So I think the combination of all of these things over time will enable us to have better ads and have them much more targeted at the right users. So that's really a combination across all of them. It is important to note that really -- like one thing that distinguishes our Display strategy is that we are focused on building an end-to-end platform to enable buying across the Internet for all advertisers and for all publishers. And we believe that if we do that and if we do that efficiently, that there will be a lot more dollars that will move over, as Nikesh mentioned, from off-line to online, which is where the users are moving. And so we just need to make sure that the systems and the technology can support that.
Patrick Pichette
Just to reemphasize, just that last point from Susan, there are properties that are going to be kind of tuned to Display, right? It's true for YouTube. It's true -- but the ecosystem itself of the entire web is so much more powerful, and that's why we have the strategy we have.

We'll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Two questions, please. The first one, was just wondering if tablet operating share is important to Google as smartphone share. And given Apple's different lower margin pricing strategy on tablets, how Google plans to influence market share in that category. And then just one follow up.
Patrick Pichette
Sure. Jeff, comments on tablet versus smartphones versus PCs.
Jeffrey Huber
Yes. This is Jeff. Tablets are doing very well. There's certainly been a lot of growth in that segment. And in terms of its dynamics, there are some interesting properties where it's really a hybrid between a mobile device and a desktop when you look at user behavior and the kind of things that they're doing with it. So it sort of falls between the two of those. We are very optimistic. Android has some great products coming along. We have the Honeycomb operating system that is developed specifically for tablet application. The Motorola XOOM is the first device that's come along, runs on Motorola now. It was the product of the show at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. I think you'll see a lot of other products coming along and a lot of innovation in the market around tablets and that format. We have also introduced, just jumping into Ads for a little bit, recently, a feature where we can enable advertisers to specifically target tablet devices, which we think will also help that segment.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
And then secondly, just to the extent that employee bonuses may be partially tied to your social efforts, just wondering if you could define success in that area.
Patrick Pichette
I think what we're going to do is because this is an internal matter -- I mean, the key message that I'd like to leave with everybody is, right, we focus, as we said, across the strategy and across many platforms. We wanted to signal to the employees that social is clearly a signal that is worth investing in, and that's why we've made the decision. But we wouldn't comment further on that.

Our next question comes from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
Two questions. When we talk to a lot of your shareholders, I think the general view is that Search is such a great business and a phenomenal asset. However, it seems like at the same time, there seems to be kind of a growing concern that engagement seems to be a bigger theme that seems to be winning out of this industry, whether it be from smaller companies that have unique products or just different approaches in the marketplace. I'm curious, have you guys looked at the 70/20/10 approach to the business and rethought maybe the allocation should be shifted a bit towards building greater engagement in the business, try to maybe kind of look at how other products and services can be integrated in? I guess, that's question number one. I have a quick follow up.
Patrick Pichette
Let me give you a mega answer related to that, which is if you think of the web in general and how the platforms are growing, right, we would argue that where we're focusing our investment is in areas where -- yes, engagement matters. But if you think of where we're putting emphasis in local, for example or in Mobile, for example or for YouTube, for example, right, all of these areas are all about engagement and their engagement between advertisers and small, medium businesses and their customers that are walking down the street and then adding more signals to the quality of their restaurant experience they had or otherwise. It's true for YouTube, with so much more different kind of either lean back, with kind of chatting and giving kind of ratings. And every one of our products has just naturally evolved. And then with -- again, with Mobile and same thing with Chrome, we see many of these areas. Engagement is another element of the strategy that's kind of pervasive across, but the technology themselves also fuel that. So it's kind of a symbiotic relationship between the two. So at the highest level, Search itself is so much more engaged today than it was three years ago and will be even more engaged in the coming three years. So it's absolutely part of the fabric of the strategy we have.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
It sounds like we may be missing it in that it's engagement through frequency of services utilized through everyday life as a consumer as of the, say, engagement through just a share of time over one continuous spectrum.
Patrick Pichette
Well, you have it across -- like, when you're in YouTube, right, the question is are you spending more minutes of your day actually on YouTube, and that's opportunities for engagement. When you're with your Android phone and you're actually living down the street, and you're now in town, your engagement opportunities, both in terms of the product that you use and the engagement of the additional signals that you get with sharing with your friends or otherwise, right, continue to fuel it. But absolutely, the core platforms that we have in place will have that as a core element.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
So this Chrome -- just a quick question on Chrome. But do you -- does that give you the potential to create unique products inside of Chrome, such as obviously, folding in apps from Google, as well as creating digital content services within the Chrome environment?
Jeffrey Huber
Yes. This is Jeff. There is great opportunity in Chrome. You start to see the beginnings of that, in that we launched a capability a while ago called the Chrome Web Store, which is bringing the same kind of model that we have with Android Market to that platform. And there's a tremendous amount of innovation that is happening on the web as a platform that we think Chrome will be able to take advantage of and be the best on ramp for.

Our next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
I have two questions. First, on the Mobile opportunity. What do you think a Mobile user is approximately worth today on an annual basis? And where do you think that can trend as you bring in more local and commerce capabilities? And then real quick, second for Patrick, how should investors think about the financial parameters around potentially larger acquisitions? I'm not talking about the little tech-in type of deals, but if you -- as Google maybe contemplates some bigger type of company purchases, if you will.
Patrick Pichette
Great. Who wants to tackle Mobile? Jeff?
Jeffrey Huber
Yes. So in terms of the specifically quantifying the value of a Mobile user today, that's not something that I can comment on specifically as of how we're valuing them. That said, if you look at the kind of investment which we're making, if you look at the focus of the organization, it is something that we're very, very excited about. And I think that there is great potential there. And if you look at some of just the monetization side of it, there's things that we've done around Click-to-Call ads, if you think about very locally targeted ads that is a capability of our platform. The ability to engage users where they're at with commercial opportunities, it's tremendous overall. So we think that's great. In terms of where it trends over time, increasingly the smartphone is becoming an extension of the person. It becomes how they do everything, how they communicate, how they're entertained, how they're informed. So we think that there will be convergence over time between the phone or mobile device and other behavior that people are historically familiar with.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Is there an order of -- if I can maybe follow up on that. Is there an order of magnitude that you think can take place from today versus, say, three years from now without maybe giving specific numbers?
Susan Wojcicki
Hi, this is Susan. I'm going to answer that one. I mean, I -- one way I would think about that, if I think we're still very, very early on in what Mobile can do. But I do think that Mobile will bring completely new ways that we will be interacting with merchants, with advertisers, with our friends over time, and the value of those transactions can be very valuable. But I think what it will actually do is it will grow the overall opportunity, the overall pie and enables us to interact in new ways. So it's hard at this point to really estimate how that will change over time other than we think it's going to grow a lot and that there will be new models that we don't have today.
Patrick Pichette
Yes. So you -- to summarize these two thoughts together, without like really any radical effort -- let me take the case for Android. That is the platform that enabled so much of it. We already announced at the end of Q3 that this was $1 billion run rate business, and we tripped into it with people kind of adapting what was desktop onto Mobile that was clunky. And it's growing at an amazing, blazingly pace in terms of usage. So what you do know is the combination of -- if you think of the areas of Search, of local, of commerce, of entertainment and just on Mobile, just -- we tripped into $1 billion. It just gives you the sense of momentum for the opportunities ahead of us, and that's why we have the focus areas that we have. So that's why we're so optimistic about Mobile. Now Jason, if I circle back to your financial parameters for larger acquisitions, we're quite disciplined, and we've made that comment many times about acquisitions in general at Google. And we have a quadrant in which we operate, where you're looking for the perfect mix between intellectual properties of great code, a great team and great products at a price that we can afford that we think makes strategic sense. So many of -- like, you hear of all the stories of the acquisitions we make. What you don't hear is all the acquisitions that we actually refuse, because they just don't pass our bar. In the case of large transformative ones, we look at them all the time, right? If we had one that actually made sense to finally accelerate a big piece of our agenda, we would do it. We just have not found one yet. And so we'll continue to look at it. We have the position to be able to jump and make big acquisitions. We just want to make sure that we don't have distractions. We have a very focused agenda, and you have to have a really good fit, because big acquisitions can be a massive distraction for Google. Google has a specific culture. It's quite a unique culture. And in that context, we want to make sure that if we were ever to make a large acquisition, it would have to pass a double bar of not only strategic, financial sense, but in addition to that, that it wouldn't become a distraction to the company but in fact, accelerate it. That's a pretty high bar to pass.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
Two questions. One for Susan and then kind of a bigger picture question. So when we think about the company's ability to grow into local, how important is a local sales force? And are we starting to see the impact of adding local sales people on the expenses? And then secondly, the reorganization, as far as under Larry, based on kind of product would make sense, particularly where we all believe the Internet's going, when we think about, however, like if I look on your Google products page, right? There are just still an enormous amount of products the company offers, albeit revenue is generally concentrated in a few of those products, do you think we'll see a streamlining of products available under the new kind of reorganization?
Patrick Pichette
So I'll let Nikesh talk about the local area, where on the sales side, he's been kind of spearheading activities. And then I'll give you a conversation about the org issues.
Nikesh Arora
Hi. I guess it's important to understand that with millions of advertisers who we service through our various advertising products, we are constantly in touch with small, medium, large business across the board. And most recently we've turned on phone support and on-boarding and soft landing for all of our small advertisers. We do interact with small business. As we have products that work more and more with local advertisers, we anticipate having a team that works with those advertisers. Now how we do it is still something we are constantly debating. In some cases, it works really well with our existing call centers or our existing teams, which work from around the world. It sometimes requires people on feet on the street, which we also have in over 40 countries around the world. So we are going to use a sort of combination of existing sales teams and sales methods and other sales teams and sales methods that might be required to drive some of our products whether they're in the commerce area, the local area or in the area of providing offers to our customers. But more on that as we continue to drive those products to our sales.
Patrick Pichette
For the issue of broad organization, let me make two comments. The first one is we are -- the realignment that Larry talked about earlier on this call has been really about an organization model that we had, where there was a end person and a product person for every core of our product and then often also a salesperson. And so if you think of having to have two or three products to work together, how you end up with sometimes six or nine decision makers having to align themselves. Larry made a very specific call to say for every one of those core product areas -- and we have one here in the room, in fact two, in the room which is Jeff for Commerce and Local. Jeff is now the final arbiter and decision maker -- and that's to drive velocity. And by the way, take comfort also that these are -- the reorg has been on all of the core pillars of the company. So the real core issue that we wanted to make sure, that Larry wanted to have in place when he kind of launched into as CEO is clear decision makers for velocity, and everybody takes comfort about that. And for the rest of the smaller ones, right, too early to tell. We're just not there yet. We're really focused on the big areas for now and then when the time comes, we'll cover the smaller areas. That's the way we approached it, and we're really thrilled to see the momentum already.
Operator
Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company.
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
Two quick questions, please. First, starting with Susan. I know you guys won't break out absolute dollar numbers, but if we just look at the non-search, non-CPC business, I mean with CPM and CPA, can you just help us understand or kind of quantify what kind of revenue growth did you see either on a year-on-year basis or on a sequential basis, just to kind of see the magnitude of your success there? And then I guess maybe for Jeff, Google has been pretty quiet about its video strategy out of YouTube's -- outside of YouTube's user-generated content. Does Google have a video strategy for non-UGC that you can speak to us about?
Patrick Pichette
On the first -- let me talk about the latter one first and then let Susan talk about the first one. On the non-UGC content, we have made a number of addition to the YouTube team that have very specific expertise in that area. So you should kind of consider that we have a focus on it, but we have nothing specific to announce. Jeff may have additional comments on that.
Jeffrey Huber
Yes, the -- with YouTube, YouTube's roots obviously start with user-generated content. There's a tremendous both size and activity in the user base there. So there's a great asset that we begin with. We are interested in long-form premium content in the longer-term role of YouTube. Another area that we're very excited about and we announced an acquisition this quarter, a company called Next New Networks, which is signaling intent for developing content that is kind of up volume for this new medium that's being created. So I think you'll see a lot more of that as well.
Patrick Pichette
Susan, on the first question of non-CPC revenues and models?
Susan Wojcicki
Sure. Actually, one thing I do want to kind of step back for is that we are thinking about the best way for our advertisers to be bidding and to be paying for ads across Search and Display. And so we -- with Search, for example, we are enabling our advertisers to bid, for example, with a CPA target. Then Google will figure out the CPCs and the backgrounds. So that's one way that was found, for example, has really grown advertisers' spend on Search. The Product Listing Ads that I talked about in the script actually works with the CPA model. So in Display, we have advertisers who bid on a CPC basis, and when they bought they also bid on a CPM basis. Right now -- and we see advertisers participating in both. A lot of times it has to do with the objective of the advertiser in terms of whether they're more performance driven or more brand driven. As we release more brand features, like I mentioned, like the reserve, that will be a CPM feature. And so really, what we see is that the bidding is very important, that we want to give advertisers a lot of flexibility and how they actually buy it and how they're able to optimize depending upon their objective. And there's no one right way. There's just -- there's a series of things that we will offer to make sure that we have the right product for the advertiser.

Our next question comes from Jordan Rohan with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Jordan Rohan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Sure. A couple of smaller questions. Can you be a bit more specific about the magnitude of the disruption in the Japanese search market that you saw in the quarter? And second, Android, you mentioned 350,000 devices activated per day. Can you give us some understanding of how that breaks down by smartphone versus tablet and U.S. versus international?
Patrick Pichette
So on Japan, let me make two comments. One is the events really shocked us as well at Google. And I just want to kind of let the investors know that our first and first response to all the events were really to actually help the Japanese community. So it was about people finding people and all the tools that we have for disaster recovery. We spent a lot of time at Google to actually focus on the community rather than trying to optimize anything that had to do with revenue. Clearly, the month of March has seen some impact from revenue, because all of the community in Japan was focused on the events themselves. Tons of searches, by the way, but not monetizable sort of searches. Japan is a great market for us, and it was and continues to be a very good performing market. So from that perspective when we look ahead into Q2 and Q3, the one thing we do know is we've actually asked -- we made a quick search. We asked Hal Varian, our Chief Economist, to look at other events that would have occurred in Japan of say kind of that type of magnitude to see the resiliency of Japan. And he looked, for example, at the economic recovery after the Kobe disaster of '95. And Japan is actually a first-world country with a very good infrastructure. So they bounce back fast. So although we don't -- we can't predict how the Japanese economy is going to rebound on advertising and -- what is very clear is they are a first-world economy that will recover. So from right now, all we can do is say it's already a strong economy for us and a strong market, right? It has had an impact in Q1. We expect some impact in Q2 as they try to recover, but it will continue to be a strong market for us. So that's on the first -- on the second question. On the first question, why don't I turn it over to Jeff?
Jeffrey Huber
Yes. So on Android, as mentioned, over 350,000 devices a day are being activated, which is just tremendous growth. In terms of breaking out share by device or by market, we don't break out share by device. If you just look though at where the distribution relationships and partnerships are, obviously, we've got a great presence in the U.S., strong partners in Europe, Japan, Korea. So international is really growing as a component of the overall pie. In terms of phones versus tablets, Android is relatively early on with tablets. So we have the Honeycomb operating system now, which is developed specifically for the devices. We've got some great initial devices like the Motorola XOOM. But as I mentioned earlier in one of the questions, we're seeing just a tremendous amount of innovation in the markets, but I think you're going to see a lot more great Android tablet devices soon.
Patrick Pichette
Okay, we have time -- we're over time already, so we'll take one last question. I just -- before we take the last question, can I just say that for those on the call that may be having trouble accessing our financial slides, we're working on this issue right now. And it should have been fixed for most of the users and will be done very, very shortly. So just to let you know. So Jay, let's take our last question, please.
Operator
Our final question comes from Heath Terry with Canaccord.
Heath Terry - Canaccord Genuity
Nikesh, you mentioned that video is changing everything in Display. Much of the video inventory at YouTube is still going unmonetized. What's limiting that, since clearly, the demand from advertisers is there? And is there a roadmap you can talk about or a level that you're thinking of in terms of getting YouTube to what you would consider full monetization?
Nikesh Arora
I think it's important to understand we monetize video not just on YouTube but also rich media across the Google Display Network. So our intent and our hope is to try and monetize video as a format across the various publisher partners that we have. So that's our point number one. In terms of being able to monetize and continue to grow that, you have to understand there is a value chain that goes through this. We have to make sure that we have the right advertisers, who are excited about this as a medium. I have to make sure that the creative agencies adapt their creatives to work with sort of multiple users. They don't -- you can't just create one ad, which is going to be used on YouTube with 10 million views. You actually have the ability to personalize and target them a bit more. So the creative industry needs to get involved a little bit more in trying to find creative ways, no pun intended, to be able to target all the users that the advertisers would like to target. But having said that, it is a process of selling. We have the sales teams in force. We have the technology in place. We have it integrated across the technology chain in terms of through our exchanges, through our ad serving platforms, et cetera. So we are going down the path [ph] now. We're working with the creative agencies and the most important, the analysis agencies, who actually can prove that there is value in shifting some of the dollars in television towards mediums like YouTube and other video sites around the world. So we're very happy with the progress we're making. We think also that the ducks are in a row. And we hope as we continue to see this trend, this trend is going to shift lots and lots more dollars away from what is now traditionally television towards what I call IP-based video delivery.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. So with that, let me just take two last comments. The first one is, as usual, thank our Googlers. I mean, Jeff and Susan and Nikesh and I kind of look good here giving you these great results with 27% year-over-year growth and so many innovations in so many areas of the company. It is really the result of our fantastic Googlers working all the time on all of these areas. So I would just want to thank them. 
And also, my last closing notes on Jonathan. Everybody commented on Jonathan. He couldn't be here today, because it was already planned that he had a vacation with his family. So we're glad to have Susan and Jeff with us. Clearly, Jonathan's passion for our product is legendary at Google. I don't think that the word is too strongly stated. He loved the tension between the combination of Search and Search monetization. And just to quote him, from one of his last times, he said as Search gets better, it actually creates another huge challenge for us, which is the ads need to keep pace to get better too. Otherwise, what would happen is people will click on fewer ads and well that -- to quote him, well, that would be bad. So as a Jonathan-ism to close the call, it's very obvious that we keep -- we just are immensely thankful for Jonathan's contribution and leadership, and we'll keep focused. I know that he's going to be overlooking on us to make sure that we keep that balance between Search and Ads and all the other innovations. 
With that, Jay, I will let you close the call. And thank you, everybody, for taking the time this afternoon to listen to the story of Q1. We'll talk to you in Q2.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Schmidt
Thank you very much, Jane, and thanks, everybody, for getting on our call. Your time's very valuable. I'm really glad that you all could join us for our quarterly call as reasonably scheduled. We've jumped on the call to talk about the other announcement of this afternoon, which I think everybody is getting a chance to read. 
We've had a very strong quarter and a very strong year. And I think as our resultS show today, our outlook is very, very bright. Larry and Sergey and I spent the lot of time talking about how to run everything. The last decade, of course, had been fantastic and we anticipate this will continue. How can we run the company even better? And just after a long series of conversations, we decided to make some changes in the way we are structuring, the way we actually operate things. 
Historically, we've always been running the decisions together. And ultimately, it adds delay and so forth in the way we make decisions. It's actually better to clarify it. So the proposal, which would ultimately now the board has completely approved, is by elevating me and by having Larry running things day-to-day, Sergey focusing on the areas he's going to talk about. We think that this will produce even better success for the corporation. And of course, we're going to do all this by April. So, Larry, do you want to introduce a little bit about your thoughts?
Larry Page
Well, first, I want to really congratulate Eric. He's done an outstanding job leading Google for the last decade. I don't think when Sergey and I started the company, we would have imagined, we could have possibly have imagined we would have a better leader for the company. And we all are in great debt to Eric. And I think the results really speak for themselves. There is no debate about that at all. And there's really know one else in the universe that could have accomplished what Eric has done. And Eric is really a tremendous leader, and I've learned a ton from him over the years. And I think his advice and efforts going forward as Executive Chairman would be invaluable to me and to the company as I start this new role.
Google and I want to say is just incredible opportunity. And when we started Google, people actually thought we were coming in too late, that there were already a lot of other search engines. And the Internet and really people's computing life is really still at the very early stages. And I could not be more excited about moving us forward, and we're really only at the beginning. I just can't wait to get it started
Eric Schmidt
Thank you, Larry. Sergey, do you want to talk a little bit about what you would like to get done in this new structure?
Sergey Brin
I'd like to, first at the outset, mention that I had a great time working together with Larry now for about 15 years and with Eric for about a decade. And both of them have really inspired me and moved me, and I'm looking forward to many more decades of work together.
Now as we have tried to make, to clarify our respective roles now, I would like to work more on my personal passions, which corresponds of several significant new products that I hope to tell you about in the future. I'm not going to, I know it's been accused of vaporware just recently in the press and what not, so I don't want to repeat that error. And I hope to tell you about them in the future when I'm ready to show you something.
But nonetheless, it's really a privilege to work with these two gentlemen, to continue to work with them, and at this company that I've been really proud to be part of all this time.
Eric Schmidt
Thank you very much. And as for myself, I want to get a chance to work on the things that I'm most interested in, taking a more strategic view of things. And I'm going to focus on customers, partners, various government communications, external issues more than the internal issues that I've historically been focusing on. So that's a significant, I think, improvement in the kind of things that I could do with my time. 
And I want to say very clearly that I believe Larry is ready. He's been working on this area for a long time. His ideas are very interesting and clever, and it's time for him to have a shot at running this and doing it. And I'm sure he'll do a fantastic job. 
It's interesting that a decade goes by very fast when you work in a partnership as wonderful as this has been, and I'm quite sure that this partnership will continue. We're friends, we're co-workers, we're computer scientists, we have a common vision. I don't anticipate any material change in any of our strategies or anything. We tend to agree on pretty much everything. But I do believe that as a result of this, we'll operate and execute the business even better. So with that, I thought maybe what we should do is have a few questions before we rush off. And then, Patrick, thank you so much for accommodating us on to your call.
Patrick Pichette
It's our pleasure. Jay, if you don't mind, what we'll do is we'll have two sets of questions for this afternoon. We'll just take a few questions now because we have Larry, Sergey and Eric. And so we'll take a few questions. And then after that, we'll close that section of the call, let them run back, go back to work, guys. And then we'll take the regular call as we usually proceed. 
So, Jay, if I can ask you to give us the instructions to take a couple of questions for Eric, Larry and Sergey?
Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to James Mitchell of Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
I guess one question I have just stemming from the results from the movements perhaps, when I look at the investments in 1118 Avenue in New York City, do you feel that Google is now at a point where in order to continue facilitating the growth of the Internet, that there will be a land grab for desirable physical locations?

I think our primary reason for purchasing the building there was not the Internet infrastructure there but rather the office space that we really enjoy using. The Internet tenants are great, well-paying tenants. We appreciate having them there, but that's not the primary reason why we purchased the building.

Our next question comes from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG
Just a big picture question for Eric. You mentioned that one of your areas of focus will be on government outreach, and it seems like Google's maybe come under a little more regulatory scrutiny over the past several years. So I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about your strategy with regulators to just ensure that Google can continue to expand as necessary?
Eric Schmidt
The simple answer is that we're talking to them. An awful lot of the problems that we've been having are people don't actually understand what we really do and what we don't do, and some of our competitors are assisting in that misinformation. And so part of our core strategy is literally to communicate. This is what we're doing. We're trying to be as transparent and collaborative as possible. I will tell you very clearly that the regulators have a proper job to do. They're there for a reason and we respect that. And so far, we've been quite successful by just taking the time to get people to understand. And we're sensitive to the close lines.  This is where we get too close to something and we try to stay away from that. We try to stay well within the safety zone of the way we're operating, with respect to the legal issues and the competitive issues. We also argue very strongly that the things that we're doing are very pro-competitive. And I genuinely believe that, and I'll be telling people a lot of that for a long time as expected.

Our next question will come from Imran Khan with JPMorgan.
Imran Khan - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Larry, as you become the CEO, I think it was just very interesting juncture of Google's life cycle. And I think there's a lot of questions that we get from investors that the proliferation of social networking and how the traffic, more and more traffic source to the social networking platforms are becoming. So as Google get to the next level, how do you think about the realtime search in the social networking platforms that are becoming a better brand and the Web applications and the Mobile apps? How do you think Google will become the point of play and you can send traffic to other places?
Eric Schmidt
Sergey, you've been driving most of this, and maybe, Larry, you could comment as well.
Sergey Brin
Yes. I think that you point out two important trends, I think. One is the notion of realtime. And the other, the broad notion of social in terms of identity, relationships and so forth. And I think both of those are very important to search. In fact, you've seen over the past year or so us roll out functionality along those lines. First of all, of course, we have the realtime updates now built into our Search, which includes Twitter and other sources. You've also seen us to deploy social search, which allows you to find search results that are related to people who you know and friends of their friends and so forth. And you see those right in the main Search Results of the Web. But I think that this is really just the tip of the iceberg. And I think there is far more opportunity. We've touched just 1% of the capabilities that could be deployed in that realm. And I think you should expect us to continue to develop those kinds of capabilities.
Eric Schmidt
Larry, did you want to add anything to that?
Larry Page
I mean I have the last part of what Sergey said really resonates with me. I think that there's -- if you think about the next five years of what your life will be like, online and socially, and what kind of things the tools would be able to do, we're only at the very, very early stages of that. And I'm incredibly excited about the possibilities to come.

Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch
We've noticed a lot of changes on the site, moving you farther down the purchasing funnel. And we've heard some regulatory pushbacks, so maybe this is a question for you, Eric, but also potential some advertiser complaints. So I'm just wondering how the changes in your Search Ad results, are they really driving your revenues and helping drive the strong growth? And how are you dealing with the advertisers and the regulatory environment on some of those changes that might be replacing some of the functionality of other websites?
Eric Schmidt
There's no question that our extraordinary results are partly coming from algorithmic improvements that we do all the time. Our basic strategy, of course, is to have the right ad and the right spot done exactly right every time. And we do, literally, billions of these every day. And so that's sort of the great magic of Google, if you will. We've looked very, very carefully at how we make the decisions as to which ads go where, and so forth. And we're pretty happy with the choice that we make in terms of ranking ads, and so forth. There have been some competitor complaints and so forth of that, and we're doing a pretty thorough review. But so far, we're pretty happy with them, we think it will pass the necessary complaints and so forth that people are hearing.
  So I think with that, I think we sort of run -- Patrick is saying we really run over our time. I really appreciate everybody sort of letting us come in and do this. I wanted to say to you that it's been a great privilege to be the CEO for 10 years, literally, a decade. And a decade is a long time to be a CEO. So I'm very much looking forward to this new role, a more strategic role in something where I can work on some new things, which I'm excited about. And I'm even more looking forward to working with my, literally, best friends and partners, Larry and Sergey. And I hope you all understand how powerful this triumvirate has been and how for us personally, and how much it means to us as individuals. 
So thank you all and, Patrick, do you want to sort of take over?
Patrick Pichette
Absolutely. Thank you so much, Larry, Sergey, Eric, to take the time to join us this afternoon. 
So with that, what we'll do is, if you don't mind muting your buttons, we're going to jump right into it. And we'll go to our more regular conversations. So I will start with my opening remarks and the financials, Jonathan is going to give us his read of the year, and then we'll be joined by Nikesh for our Q&A section.
So how else to talk about 2010 in Q4 as a phenomenal ending to the very good year at Google? I mean, our incredibly strong performance in Q4 and 2010 overall, is really a testimonial to the fundamental trends in a digital economy. Those trends, they're fueling huge opportunities for innovation, for growth, both at Google, but also in the entire ecosystem. One of these profound trends is the shift from advertising offline to online, and it continues at a quite rapid clip. And you've seen it fueling growth both in our core Search business but across the board as well. A case in point is revenue growth has in our core accelerated strongly in the second half of 2010, which is really particularly impressive, if you think about it, given that in Q4 2009 was itself a very strong quarter.
So in addition, investments in our newer businesses, the usual suspects of Display, Mobile, Enterprise, they are also in parallel, creating a second powerful growth engine for Google. Jonathan will give you more details on that in a minute. But at a high level, I just want to make it clear that how can we not be happy with the overall performance and trajectories of 2010 and on that basis, be excited about our prospects for 2011 and beyond. So let me turn for the specifics of the performance of the quarter now.
Let's go through the results. Gross revenue, we grew 26% year-over-year to $8.4 billion. Our Google website revenue was up 28% year-over-year to $5.7 billion, and we saw strengths across most major geographies and verticals. Our AdSense revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, again, with continuous strength in our Google Display Network. Our other revenue was up 31% to $273 million. 
Our global aggregate paid clicks growth was very strong, up 18% year-over-year, and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. This is really reflecting, as I mentioned, the acceleration shift of offline to online, without a doubt, as each year shows there is more and more holiday shopping happening online. Our aggregate cost-per-click growth also was pretty healthy, up 5% year-over-year, and 4% quarter-over-quarter. And note that FX had a negative impact on CPC growth year-over-year, although a positive impact quarter-over-quarter.  Remember, too, that this is an aggregate number and that includes the dot-com and AdSense properties. 
If I turn to our geographic performance, the U.S. and the rest of the world are both growing at a very healthy pace, and our results clearly show that, while the U.K. continue to lag a little bit in the global economic recovery. Revenue from the U.S. was up just shy of 30% at 29% to $4.1 billion. And in our earnings slides, that you can find at our investor website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So I encourage you to go to these slides for the exact calculations.
The international revenue accounted for 52% of our revenue, $4.4 billion, and up 25% year-over-year. And it includes $25 million of benefits from our hedging programs so a relatively small number. Using fixed exchange rates though, our international revenue would have been roughly $132 million higher year-over-year.  As I said, the U.K. was a little slower, and it was up 14% year-over-year to $878 million. 
If I turn to expenses, traffic acquisition costs at $2.1 billion, or 25% of advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $877 million, including stock-based compensation of $45 million. And finally, all operating expenses totaled $2.5 billion, including approximately $351 million in stock-based compensation, SPC. 
The increase year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to our increases in payroll, advertising and promotion spend and professional services. As a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes our stock-based compensation, increased at $3.4 billion in Q4, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 40%. 
Our headcount was up approximately 1,000 for the quarter. And we ended the year roughly at 24,400 full-time employees. Our effective tax rate, you should note, was 19% in Q4, and this reflects the R&D tax credit legislation that passed in December in the U.S. and for which we recognized the full benefit in Q4. 
Now let me turn to cash management. OI&E was $160 million for Q4, which reflects the continued good portfolio management performance, and it was offset a little bit by our FAS 133 expenses. For more detail again on OI&E, I just encourage you to refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR site. 
Our operating cash flow was very strong at $3.5 billion for the quarter. CapEx for the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, I mean, obviously significantly above the last quarter, but remember that the majority of this increase was from the purchase of the New York building.  The remaining balances was, as usual, primarily related to our data center and operations. 
As a reminder, we'll continue to make significant CapEx investments and yet, you have another data point to show that they do tend to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on when we are able to  make these investments. We're very pleased with our free cash flow. Despite having purchased the office building in New York, right just shy of $1 billion, and the office building is obviously a one-time event. 
So with all this being said, Google is in an excellent financial performance for 2010, incremental revenue for the year of $5.7 billion and operating cash flow, around $11 billion. That is a phenomenal performance, plus, a digital economy that's clearly on high gear. So why -- in that context, you can understand why we're so optimistic. And it's with confidence that we're pursuing an aggressive growth agenda. 
We talk about growth agenda means investing. And so here's a couple of places where we have decided to invest in and will continue to invest. First, we talked about the intense competition, if you remember on our last call, in for labor. So as part of this strategy to answer this challenge, we have announced a compensation change in Q4, which will affect all of our employees. 
We've made two changes to attract and retain the best talent. First, we raised all base salaries by 10% across-the-board. In addition to that, we shifted some compensation from bonus into base salary for non-execs, and I repeat or non-execs, which will result for them in more stable income for our employees. And please note that all those changes are really becoming effective on January 1 of this year, so they're not included into our Q4 results. Remember also that with salary increases come ripple effects, such as 401(k)s or employee taxes or other that will actually flow through as well.
So if that's for compensation, we've also made and continue to make strategic investments in sales and marketing for both new products but also advertiser acquisition. Product areas like Chrome and Chrome OS, which are such part of our future, follow our core philosophy of building these open platforms with big optionality and creating infrastructure where everybody on the Web can succeed. We'll continue to push on those but also, acquiring advertisers will and continues to remain a top priority.
We're also investing in our long-term infrastructure, including both facilities and our core computing network. As you've seen in Q4, the purchase of New York City office was not only a wise investment but a clear commitment to our New York City site and frankly, a reflection of our optimism about our growth prospects. Investing in innovation is also about making tough choices. And we've made them throughout 2010 as well by choosing to close products or initiatives that weren't working as well as we would have liked or just had run their courses. 
So for examples, we did shut down the Wave product, and we've also shut down our consumer channel for Nexus in 2010. And also, many other smaller projects that we wouldn't talk usually on the call but things like GOOG-411. And yes, we're investing aggressively but with discipline. Really, as we mentioned in the last call, pouring a lot of resources on what we call our hockey sticks, with a clear focus on long-term ROI. And yes, we'll continue to invest heavily but with the same proven discipline and results that you've witnessed from us over the last few years. 
So in summary, we are incredibly pleased of our performance of 2010, optimistic of our trajectory for '11 and beyond. Accordingly, we continue to invest aggressively in a bold, innovation agenda. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jonathan to speak about the product muscles in Q4 in 2010. And then we'll take it over to Q&A. Jonathan, all yours?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Well, thanks, Patrick. So we certainly did have a great year at Google. And I really like to think some of it stems from the unique way that we manage our product and engineering machine. When we hire product managers, they often come in and they ask me, they say, ""So how do we measure success at Google?""  And I always told them it's simple. At the end of the year, we make a list of all of your successes and your failures. You're then measured on the sum of your successes and by how much you learn from your failures. 
So at the beginning of 2010, one of our concerns was that as we scaled, this approach might lead to our being spread too thin. Instead, we thought, maybe we needed to put more wood behind fewer arrows. So we made some changes. And I think they addressed this concern without actually affecting the basic philosophy of how we've always run product and engineering at Google. So let's talk about what we changed.
At the beginning of the year, we decided to double down on the core, so that's Search and Search Ads, And I think the financial numbers that you guys are seeing today reflect the fact that, that was a successful bet. But behind those numbers is a really relentless stream of new features and product innovations. For example, we made a big effort this year to make Search more interactive, and you can see that with Google Instant. And then more recently, we made previews instant as well. And earlier in the year, we launched new user interfaces for both Web Search  and Image Search to make it easier and to make it more intuitive to work with the results after you run a search. 
And we're also making Search more intelligent. We made several changes to results. So you now you can see things like a concert schedule, or the answers to the questions highlighted right in the snippet. And we're also now starting to roll out Place Search. So when we know that you're looking for something that's in the neighborhood like an ice cream shop or something, we'll pull reviews, webpages, the address and the photo, altogether for you. 
We also doubled down on the Ad side of the house. In the past year, we've launched several new ad formats, which we've told you about, Sitelinks, seller rating ads. Recently, we just added this product listing ads with photos and prices. It makes sense that if I'm shopping for something like a coffee maker, it's helpful to see more information in the ad. But the biggest boost of all came from good old-fashioned ads quality improvements. Q4 was our best quarter in years from a quality standpoint. We launched over 20 updates, which led to gains that were nearly double those that we would normally see in a strong quarter. So although we've been at this for years, we're still finding lots and lots of ways to make ads better. 
The other change in 2010 was that several of our new businesses started to achieve escape velocity. And our philosophy is to encourage lots of innovation, and then we see feed the winners and starve the losers. And this creates kind of a Darwinian, but sort of Google-y, environment in which new businesses emerge and grow. And in 2010, it's really clear that some new winners started to emerge, like Display. We now have over 2 million publisher partners. The number of transactions on the DoubleClick Ad Exchange tripled, and publishers who sell their ad space via the Exchange are nearly tripling their revenue when the Exchange wins the auction.
YouTube revenue more than doubled. We began adding features like live streaming to help partners deliver and ultimately, of course, to monetize content in new ways. Enterprise added impressive customers like the U.S. government's General Services Administration. And we expanded distribution with partnerships like the deal with Softbank in Japan. Android, now activating over 300,000 phones per day. This helped drive a 10x year-over-year increase in the volume of searches from Android devices. 
Then finally, in 2010, I think we we're more structured in our approach to our business. The product and sales teams are working together more closely than ever, thanks in large part to my buddy here, Nikesh. Patrick's rigor helped us dynamically reallocate resources and as he mentioned, cancel a few projects like Wave and Nexus One direct to consumer that weren't achieving their goals. 
So what does all these mean for 2011. I think you can expect more of the same. We're going to double down again on the core of Search and Search Ads. We're going to feed the 2010 winners, Display, YouTube, Enterprise and Android, and we're going to do it all with even greater financial rigor and cross-functional coordination all over the world. 
But I'm also excited about the prospect for a couple of our newest businesses, Local and Commerce. In Local, over 5 million businesses have claimed their Google place pages. And we recently started testing a new ad product, which we called Boost, and that gives businesses a really easy and fast way to promote themselves online and to connect with the people who are searching for them. 
In Commerce, we're investing a lot to close the loop from online to offline shopping. I think I've mentioned on four different earnings calls in the past couple of years, the key to unlocking mobile commerce was to make it easier for people to both search and then to consummate their transaction from their mobile device. Someone in my team actually counted back on the calls and it was four times.  I think as smartphones become ubiquitous and local businesses put their inventory online, I think this is the year where phones will play the big role in commerce that I've long predicted. 
There will be some important differences in 2011. We will invest in hiring even more product managers and engineers. We're going to give them greater autonomy, and we're going to push them to work faster. In fact, we're asking everyone here to do more and to do it faster. 
Through the year, we'll tally our successes. I'm sure you all will probably remind us of any failures, so we can keep learning from them. I hope you all now better understand our sense of optimism from a product perspective for 2011. I'm confident you guys will help us keep track of how this year's product efforts play out on the important score card of financial progress. 
Thanks a lot and back to Patrick

Thank you, Jonathan. Now Jonathan and I have made a noble attempt on the back of the big announcement of today to keep your attention over the last 10 minutes. So I hope that you'll have taken all the notes that you had to. And now what we'll do is we'll turn it to Jay. Nikesh is joining us, so he is getting set up in his chair with his phone.

[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Research
Jonathan, I wanted to ask you question about Mobile, and specifically how Google thinks about the differences between tablet users and smartphone users, and how those differences are really influencing the high-level view of how you're viewing the overall evolving mobile market. And then Patrick, if you could address the sales and marketing line, which I think was somewhat unexpectedly high.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure, Ben, we can take that in order. I'll go with the first question. I think it's probably easier to talk about initially how tablets and smartphones are similar, right? Both of them are growing at a terrific pace. As is the case of Mobile, what we see on these devices is that search usage on the tablets tends to peak on the weekend and it dips on the weekdays, so it's generally complementary to desktop, which we've talked about before. What does that suggest? Maybe, the people are using them more for personal usage as opposed to business. We do see on tablets the weekend peak is a little bit more pronounced than it is on phones. I think that's probably the case because people pretty much always carry their smartphone during the week. Some of the bigger differences, the tablet users tend to search more for things like news and they tend to do more shopping-related topics when you compare them to smartphone users. I think there's some anecdotal data that they may convert better, but I haven't actually been through all of that in detail. I tend to think that the tablets behave a little bit more like desktop devices than do smartphones because it's a little easier to input information into them like a credit card. I think the other major difference is the UI approaches are different, right? Apps, like the Gmail App for the tablet, is more designed for the big screen. So I think they're both taking off, and the revenue from tablets as well as smartphones reflects that. Patrick?
Patrick Pichette
All right, I'll take the second question. If there is a good proof that we just don't kind of like streamline our lines in terms of expenses, but we go opportunistically and in a smart move, I think sales and marketing is a great example of that. And if you think of the last 12 months, what we've clearly shown is how much in high gear is the digital economy. And when that opportunity shows up, right, we just needed to jump on it and decide to fuel it. And on the marketing side, and even on sales, I mean Nikesh -- I'll actually ask Nikesh to give you a bit of color on the sales side. But on the marketing side, when you have big platforms like Chrome and Chrome OS, that can and will be incredibly successful if promoted. Why wouldn't you do it now? I hear from the financial community, the other side, which is what are you doing with your money? Well, we have great opportunities, why wouldn't we jump on it with this kind of market? And on the sales side, Nikesh, you could probably give a color commentary as well.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. I think what is important for you to understand, we decided to put our sort of foot to the pedal later in this year. And there was an area of our customer that advertises we decided to continue to put more focus on which is the small to medium-sized advertisers because where that's where a lot of our growth engine is going to come form in the future. And effectively, a lot of the sales costs there are advertiser acquisition's costs because once you bring them into our system, they stay there for a while. And they continue to work and continue to generate more revenues. And some of the revenue performance you're seeing has been across the small channels or the mid-tier channels, and that investment is sort of already beginning to bear fruit.

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup Inc
If I can ask a question on the local advertising play and it's sounds like you've got a couple of products you've been working on, rolling out for a while, and I think you also may have attempted an acquisition inter-quarter. Can you maybe quantify the opportunity for us, is this something that has always been part of the build up plan? Is there something you saw in the last 12 months that really indicated that this was the time to accelerate the efforts against local advertising? And then, do you already feel like you got all the assets now in place, or are you still going to look for more assets in order to have that play viable?
Patrick Pichette
Let me just -- as a preamble, all right, we do not talk about M&A. Local has always been part of our strategy. And Nikesh can talk about the initiatives, or just about the initiatives we're doing there in terms of the boost in the products that we have, or maybe Jonathan, the boost product. And just it's one more of the initiatives we have in local. But local is, just to kind of give you a sense of framework, right? It's one out of every five searches have some form of local kind of tendency or factor. So it's not kind of side event for us. Jonathan?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure, Mark. I mean, I think we've been very focused on Local since, wow, going all the way back to maybe my second year when we acquired Keyhole here with the Google, which was basically the original company that built Google Earth. And really, the idea was that ultimately the Web should be this virtual mirror of the world at all times. And that mirror of the world becomes much more useful. And when it's more relevant -- and it's more relevant to the users when you get everything organized around places in the physical world. And I think the other thing which has come into play more recently is that technology has made it possible through the use of GPS and smartphones for us to understand where you are. And so I think what we've recognized more recently is that because smartphones have become deployed more aggressively, that we can supply you with relevant information about the places that you're near with the appropriate contextual-oriented search. So if you're at a restaurant, you want to pull up a menu, you don't want just the menu that the waiter handed you, you want the one in there that has the reviews and the picks from your friends. So I think what's basically changed over the course of the last year is it's become easier for local businesses to identify themselves in context on Google, and it's become easier for us to find out where you are. And then, of course, we've mapped that with Nikesh's team, which is working on selling Boost and Tags and some of the other ad formats that we've developed specifically for Local.

Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with Barclays Capital.
Douglas Anmuth - Barclays Capital
Patrick, can you talk a little bit more about your philosophy just around the New York headquarters? I think this is the first time where you've actually really come out and confirmed the purchase. And why do you need to own the New York headquarters rather than sort of getting access to it in some other way, and why is this a good use of capital? And then secondly, can you just talk, just following up on Local, discuss whether you really are building out more of a local salesforce in addition to obviously, the local products themselves?
Patrick Pichette
I'll take the first, and then I'll let Nikesh about the initiatives we're doing on the Local side. Look, we have 2,000 employees on site today in New York. And our business and our engineering center, it's a big engineering center, by the way, it's not only a big kind of sales center but it's a big engineering center. So if you think of the eastern hub being in that place, with 2,000 and growing at the pace at which we're growing, it's actually very difficult to find in New York, a place that would accommodate that number of employees in an environment that fits Google's standards and Google's needs. We do not -- I mean, we actually believe that living in a tower where there's a very small footprint on the floor to floor is terrible for the Google culture. So there's very few buildings in New York that actually can accommodate our needs, right? Replacing that building for us or moving out of there would actually be probably very difficult to find another place and then be prohibitively expensive. And then finally, it gives us a lot of control over growing into that space. So all this to say on top of what we believe will be is a very good investment. So for all these reasons, coming back to the previous, it's not about carrier hotel owning. Everything is about the Google-iness. So for all of these reasons, I think it did make sense. And we called it a one-time item because it just fitted so well our strategy. For the Local salesforce, I'll turn it to Nikesh to give you a bit more details on our strategy there.
Nikesh Arora
I think there's more to understand that Local, the way you define that actually ends up in three different interpretations. One is we've always had local features to our adverse products. You can always localized to your advertising towards users who are in a certain area, certain territory. So you always have the ability to localize. The other thing we've done in Local is the way I think local is sometimes synonymous with smaller advertisers and smaller territories. And towards that end, we have created the most simplistic set of products around Tags and Boost, which is more amenable to the advertisers. They don't have to do a lot of work. Sometimes they don't even have their own websites. And that allows them to still participate in the online economy. And third, we, for the longest of times, had partnerships with other companies who've been selling advertising on our behalf to smaller advertisers, be it in small local areas, or we've been using other partners who will use their salesforce to call on smaller advertisers for us. So we are going to use a combination of all of these three efforts to continue to pursue our Local strategy going forward.

Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with UBS.
Brian Pitz - UBS Investment Bank
Patrick, would you give us a rough organic revenue growth rate, excluding acquisitions? And then secondly, a question on Ads, are you guys seeing any competitive share shifts in dollars from Search or Display towards other social platforms or applications?
Patrick Pichette
So on the second one, I'll let Nikesh give you a sense. On first one, I don't have the breakdown and we don't provide the breakdown. But I can tell you that all of our core properties are growing very well, and not only our core properties but also our new growth businesses as well. When you look at the numbers for just the google.com growing year-over-year, 28%, right? How can you not be happy with that kind of performance? And so overall, we're very pleased with our growth rate of revenue. I'll let Nikesh talk about the second piece.
Nikesh Arora
I think it's important to understand that Search for the longest of times had been performance advertising. And so has the large chunk of Display, it's been performance advertising. Some of the newer players you're talking about are sort of playing the brand display space. So overall if you look at it, the stronger trend is shift of brand dollars from the offline world into the online world and continue of shift to some of those dollars, of sales and marketing dollars, into performance-based advertising. So we're seeing that shift both on our Search side. We're seeing that shift both on our Display side and also, seeing some brand dollars in the Search side and some brand dollars in Display side. So I think it's more than fair to say that right now, the bigger trend is the shift from offline to online. And there has been less of an allocation shift within the online world because all these measures, all these means are measurable, and you're seeing better ROI for these measurable events in both in the performance Display, performance Search. So that's where the trend is.

If you look out and analyze the financial statements for just about any publicly traded ad network out there, these businesses seem to peak out, and the operating margin seem to peak out in the 20% to 25% range, do you think there's anything structurally different about Google's approach in the Display business that could allow Google to achieve higher operating margins? Or is it that just the peak for that kind of business model? And then, Nikesh, just the quick question on the ROW acceleration. So 31% year-over-year, can you talk a little bit about which regions that's coming from, or is it across the board? And is there any acceleration from new revenue areas like Display or is it just the core Search business?
Patrick Pichette
The fundamental -- on the first one, let me answer the Display and then I'll let Nikesh talk about the performance worldwide. I think in Display, the most fundamental issue is if you're on your own network or if you're optimizing for other's network and participating in other's network. So if you think of YouTube, it's our own property. And therefore, you have a completely different set of economics. And so you just got to make sure you don't compare apples and oranges. So one, obviously, has a much higher margin than the other, and the question then is the mix. So if you think of us in Display where we have the whole suite of services from what used to be Teracent and all the other pieces, then you have the mix of properties. And that's how you have to think about it. In terms of geographic split and performance, it's a fantastic story, so why not let Nikesh give you the color commentary on it.
Nikesh Arora
Just before this, adding to what Patrick said on the Display side, I think it's also important to understand the contribution of the Ad Exchange, which basically allows you to bring buyers and sellers together. And we are seeing a serious uplift for people who are participating on the Ad Exchange in terms of revenue. So whilst your traditional Display business, you might be seeing margins profiles are different and I can't predict the future margin profiles but clearly, there's an uplift and a benefit to advertisers who participate in the Exchange or publishers who participate in the Exchange. So that's also beneficial...
Patrick Pichette
To tell it differently, we have three resources in that because you have the Ad Exchange on top of that.
Nikesh Arora
So in terms of the sort of rest of the world performance, I think there are some things which are notable this quarter in addition to our usual stalwarts where the U.S. continues to be strong and the rest of the world is strong. Germany has maintained its strength because of its economic development, which has been different from the rest of Europe, so that has showed up in our results as well. I am very particularly excited about some of the turnaround we've achieved in Japan because we've been putting in a considerate effort over the last many months to try and put an aggressive foot out in the marketplace in terms of bringing in more partners, more advertisers and generally, upgrading the entire effort in Japan from our side, so we are seeing the results of that. In addition to that, some of the commodity markets, markets where the commodities are strong, are Brazil, Australia. So those have been strong in general. The U.K. continues to be weak, as you notice, but it is very strong market for us, it's a big market for us as well.
Patrick Pichette
In closing on that topic, I think it's worth noting if you do your financial math and you move rest of world into constant FX, so if you take out the fact that we had crosswinds over year-over-year, in fact, our growth rate for rest of world is over 30%, it's C:\Transcripts\Calls\118059477\VoiceWriter31%. So again, very good momentum there.

Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Paid click growth on a percentage basis was the highest rate in two years, and you mentioned a few things on the call, better ads, better targeting, even local monetization. And I was just wondering to what extent some other factors came into play as well, particularly Google Instant and the rollout of that product, as well as the incremental nature of smartphone and tablet queries.
Patrick Pichette
So I think that for paid click growth, that you really have to look at a couple of factors. And I just want to start by kind of debunking a myth on Google Instant, right? Everybody seems to have -- there's kind of a buzz out there that Google Instant is the driver for a lot of the revenue growth. And in fact, Google Instant is neutral. It is not making any significant contribution to our revenue growth. What's really making the contribution is that there's really -- our growth is driven by three interdependent drivers that are all acting and tooling together. One is, clearly, the strength of the economic recovery and the consumer shift online. And you can look -- ever since Thanksgiving, and you've seen it from external sources as well, people have moved online. They're spending a lot of time shopping online, looking for coupons. So the behavior is strong economic recovery, which brings a lot more auction into these -- a lot more participants into the auctions because they want to be where the users are. In addition to that, right you have a second compounding factor pounding on it which is platforms are changing, right? The use of mobile phones, iPads, Instant Search tool, but also GEO, the fact that you get instant location, you can get coupons, all these things, right, just from a platform perspective are driving it on top of it. And then finally, right, it is true that Jonathan's teams fantastic job at making great ads tuning and monetization like the VizURL, and Jonathan you may want to take a second to talk about VizURL. It's those factors that are really driving the CPC growth and the click through rate growth rather than instant search. So I just want to be clear because I know there's a rumor on the street running that it's all about Instant search. And Instant search is about the user. It's people spending 10% faster, that is a huge number, 10%. And that's why we did Instant search. So maybe VizURL is a good example that you want to talk about, Jonathan?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure. I guess other than the ads quality improvements, which I can cover in a second, I think the only other area that Patrick didn't cover would basically just be the new ad formats, all of which are boosting click through rates. And I mentioned those in my prepared remarks, the product listing ads, more recently, offer ads, coupon-based ads. The seller ratings, which we've also launched, have significant impact in click through rates as well as the Sitelinks. But I think that probably the most significant thing in terms of what impacted the whole ads area this quarter was this concept that we call Visible URL. And basically, what we did was on the top ads, we moved the advertiser's URL down to its own separate line below the creative rather than having it be part of the creative. And that obviously makes it easier for people to see where they will go as they click. It's actually a little bit of an interesting story. I'll give you some of the background because this is by far the most significant change that we had from ads quality perspective in a very long time. It turned out early in the quarter, some of the engineers in Japan noticed that it was really hard to read the creative because we actually had the ads URL, which was in Latin characters, mixed in with the ad creative which was in Kanji. And it didn't really take brilliant research to figure out that human perception gets really confused when characters switch like that in the middle of a sentence. People just sort of skip the whole sentence. And if they skip something, that's sort of really bad when that sentence is a text ad. So we ran this experiment in Japan and we moved the URL down to its own line, and click through rates went up dramatically. So we launched that feature pretty expeditiously in, I think, Japan, China, Korea and Russia. And then what happened is the engineers kind of said ""Well, hey, just for fun, let's try that in the rest of the world. "" And we actually didn't expect so much because we didn't have the same dynamic of Latin characters versus Kanji, but it turned out that people skip sentences with long, unusual words in it. So people were tuning out that line. And we quickly launched this feature globally. It was one of the fastest things that we ever launched after the ads testing. I believe we launched it right around Thanksgiving. And that had a very significant change in the clicks that we saw in the course of the quarter.
Patrick Pichette
So just to close on that, just to kind of say, it is, and I know that Jonathan has used that trumpet a number of times in the past, but just continues to illustrate how much more innovation there is left in both formats and in just all the things that we do in terms of innovation in the ad space.

Our next question comes from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
If we look at your kind of a revenue line from a kind of customer base standpoint, whether it's Fortune 500 or Ad Age 100 versus Internet pureplay indemics, and then the small to medium-size business category, I guess the SMB category was weaker during the credit crisis and you had a hard time coming back, I'm curious as to your thoughts as to how it's coming back today. And do you think there is a different way of approaching that SMB market as you look ahead into this year and going forward in terms of products or maybe ways to help drive leads or sales in that segment of the market?
Patrick Pichette
I'll let Nikesh answer the question. Just one point of clarification on your statement though and during the recession a couple of years ago, I think you mentioned that we thought that SMBs were kind of going down. And in fact, Nikesh will clarify, they were going the other way. So Nikesh, I'll leave it to you to answer the question.
Nikesh Arora
I think the important thing to understand is we're seeing such a disproportionate amount of strengths from the very large advertisers across the board because effectively what's happened over the years is that they've gone out and really strength their e-commerce offerings, they've gotten their act together, they've got all the logistics in place. And given that this was the quarter of Christmas and Thanksgiving, you saw a tremendous amount of strengths from large advertisers wanting to play against the pureplay Internet players. Now in addition to that, what has also happened is we've put an effort over the last six months on the SMB and mid-market side. In the mid-market side, we've basically gone ahead and adopted a higher touch strategy. I even spend more time on the phone with our customers. We even go and visit some of our mid-tier customers because to be fair over the years, they have grown to be larger mid-tier customers than they used to be in the past. So we have put in sort of a conscious higher touch strategy. And last but not the least, for the smaller advertisers, we are working very closely with our product team and Jonathan and his team to try and look at various systemic and algorithmic improvements we can make, working with them in large direct marketing campaigns and where we can continue to sort of reduce churn to that the area and continue to acquire more, which is related to the other comment on slightly higher sales spending on trying to acquire smaller advertisers. So we have efforts across the board, across all three categories. We don't think that effort is done and fully over with.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank AG
Do you think the business model or pricing model has to be different there, whether it's percentage of sale or some other kind of approach to going after the spend in that segment?
Nikesh Arora
No, I think to be fair, if you look at the simplifications we have done on the ad work side and local products, which is another way of thinking about smaller advertisers, that is a way to create a simpler product for them where they don't have to put in a lot more effort or we have things like keyword-less ads where they don't have to go ahead and sort of work towards creating keywords or will work. On the Display side, we've got contextual targeting where you can create ad groups very, very quickly. So we may continue to make product improvements which allow things to become more and more simple so advertisers can sort of go and do their daily business as opposed to spend time understanding more complicated stuff on our side. So yes, you're right, they are different, simpler products we create for them, which have slightly different pricing, so that they can continue to participate in the online economy.

Our next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo Securities.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
I had a question just on the Mobile business. Last quarter, obviously, you saw some increased momentum. I'm curious just from a pricing perspective, what you're starting to see from the advertisers? And what kind of progress did you see over the last 90 days? And maybe more importantly, as NFC starts to become more prevalent in smartphones, I mean how do you think that changes the dynamic in terms of what type of effective monetization you're going to see from the Local Commerce side?
Patrick Pichette
So let me give you just a few starts to kind of continue to keep the contacts, right? Mobile search grew 4x on Mobile devices for web browsers in the last year. So there is no doubt that this market is just absolutely cranking. And there's a lot of work, and I'll let Jonathan talk about it, about ad formats are still kind of nascent and building, both on the Display side and on the regular side, and we see a lot of upside. Jonathan, you probably want to kind of cover those.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes. We don't really actually break out the details in terms of the exact difference. It's certainly the Click-to-Call ads are generating millions of calls every month. A lot of advertisers are running these campaigns. I think one you can see if you tried is DirectTV. We did launch a call-only option where the only clickable link in the ad is actually a phone number, which not surprisingly substantially increases the click through rates on mobile devices. And we've extended some of the desktop formats pretty successfully to Mobile. Sitelinks is one. If you try a query on Oakley, you'll see one, if you seller ratings on something like running shoes. So I think there's a lot more to learn there, but the advertisers are very excited and engaged. At the moment, I don't have any specific comments on NFC other than to go back to the statements that I've made in previous calls, which is when people are completing transactions with these devices, it becomes much more tractable and obviously significantly more valuable.

Our last question comes from Steve Weinstein with Pacific Crest.
Steve Weinstein - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.
First, you commented that you're going to be shifting more compensation to base pay from bonus. I was wondering if you could let us know what the ratio had been historically as far as those two components of comp? And finally, obviously, the acceleration of all the metrics is pretty exciting, pretty positive for the outlook. I was wondering if you could help us understand though how much acceleration is happening within the core business? And how much of the acceleration is maybe some of the newer businesses really starting to get some scale, and maybe tipping the overall momentum in the business?
Patrick Pichette
On compensation first, as I said, we raised all salaries. So if you think of kind of financial modeling for a second, all salaries had been raised 10% across-the-board, January 1. And that has a ripple effect on -- the kind of ripple effect of the employee taxes, 401(k)s and all the rest of the benefits. It will also impact, obviously, everybody that we bring on this year as well. So as we bring in new people, they are costing us now slightly more. In addition to that, what we've done is part of the bonus is kind of calculated without giving you the exact number. We had two components to our annual bonus. One, which is a company multiplier, and one which is an individual multiplier. And what we've done for the non-execs, because we want execs to actually continue to be treated differently, the non-execs are treated in that what used to be a company multiplier, which didn't really have a lot of influence on, we shifted over to base pay. And their individual multiplier component of the bonus continues to be a very kind of directly involved into their calculation of their personal bonus. So by shifting that company multiplier we didn't have a lot of influence on, right, it just moves into more predictable cash flows for them all through the year rather than waiting for the end of the year, and that was the rationale for doing it. In terms of revenue growth, I mean, last quarter, we gave kind of two syndication points on Display, on Mobile, right? We've talked about the fact that our core -- if you look at our Enterprise Business, 30 million users, 3 million businesses on apps, the kind of magnitude of numbers we're talking about in each of our growth areas, whether it be Mobile, whether it be Android, whether it be YouTube, where we continue to have YouTube, right. I mean to give you a snippet, YouTube's revenue more than doubled in 2010, right? So that's why we're optimistic across-the-board, and that's why we're very kind of open about the fact that when you have such a digital economy running in high gear, why don't you take the opportunity to invest at the time where it is actually transforming itself. And that's what we're doing, and we're delighted in fact to continue to push hard on that. And that's what you see also in sales and marketing.
With that -- let me reiterate, so I probably hope I got your attention back because the front end of this conversation got totally sideswiped by the big three, you guys showing up and taking over our seats and phones, but phenomenal year end to what has been a terrific year. I have to thank all of our Googlers. They do an amazing job every day. It looks easy when I show up with Jonathan and Nikesh and talking about these fantastic results, but our Googlers do an amazing job all around the world, and so does our partners. And so to them, thank you so much for your fantastic efforts in 2010, and we'll just set up for a fantastic 2011 again. With that, I'll let Jay close the call.

Good day and welcome everyone to the Google Inc. third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Jane Penner, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Jane Penner
Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to today’s third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, Product Management; and Nikesh Arora, President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development.
First, Jonathan and Patrick will provide us with their thoughts on the quarter, then Nikesh will join Patrick and Jonathan to answer your questions.
Also, as you know, we recently began distributing our earnings release exclusively through our Investor Relations Website located at investor.google.com. So, please refer to our IR Website for our earnings releases as well as supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our Website in a few hours.
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google’s future and investments in our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.

Please note that certain financial measures we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin are also expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As Jane mentioned, Jonathan and I will begin with our prepared remarks, and then Nikesh will join us for Q&A.
In addition and as a bit of a surprise, we may actually have Eric join us for the first 30 minutes of Q&A before he has to run to a plane. So, let me start by giving you some general thoughts before I get into the details of our financial performance for Q3. At the highest level, we are very pleased with our Q3 results and it’s clear that the digital economy continues to grow rapidly, a relentless trend that continues to drive continued growth in both our core business, core search and creating market and also for fuelling momentum in our newer businesses.
Our Q3 results clearly reflect this phenomenon that is our continued strong growth in our core business and continued very strong growth in our emerging businesses year-over-year, and indeed we saw strength in every major product area in Q3, that is search, display, mobile as well as apps enterprise. And when I say our newer businesses are seeing great momentum, I really mean it, and in that, Jonathan will back that statement up with some hard facts in a few minutes. So, stay tuned for the details.
Now, let’s turn to specifics of our performance in the quarter from a financial perspective. Let’s move quickly to the results. Gross revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $7.3 billion. Our Google Website revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, which strength as I mentioned across most major geographies and verticals. Our AdSense revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, again reflecting continued strength in our Google display network.
Our other revenue was up 35% year-over-year to $254 million, down sequentially reflecting the end of our direct-to-consumer sale of the Nexus One. Our global aggregate paid click growth remained healthy up 16% year-over-year and also up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate cost per click growth was up 3% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. You should note that the FX had a negative impact on CPC growth year-over-year, but the impact for quarter-over-quarter was quite neutral. Remember too that this is an aggregate number which includes both Google.com and our AdSense properties.
So, now turning to our geographic performance, the U.S. and rest of world are growing at a healthy pace as our results reflect, but also, while the U.K. continues to lag a little bit in the economic recovery again seen in our results. Revenue from the U.S. was up 26% year-over-year to $3.5 billion and in our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor Relations Website, you will see that we have broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world to show you the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So, please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
International revenues accounted for 52% of our total revenue or $2.8 billion, up 20% year-over-year which includes a $89 million benefit from our hedging programs, and that compares to a $39 million benefit for Q3 of last year. If we used fixed exchange rates, our international revenues would have been roughly $169 million higher year-over-year. U.K. was up 10% year-over-year to $840 million, but actually if using a fixed exchange rate, that number would have been just shy of 20%.
So now, let me turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition costs were $1.8 billion or 26% of total advertising revenue for this quarter. Other cost of revenue was $747 million including stock-based compensation of $8 million and finally all other operating expenses totaled $2.2 billion, including approximately $372 million of stock-based compensation. The increase year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to increase in payroll, professional services, and advertising and promotional spend. So, as a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit which excludes the stock-based compensation increased to $2.9 billion in Q3, resulting in our non-GAAP operating margin of 40.2%, essentially the same as last year.
Headcount was up approximately 1,500 versus Q2, and we ended the quarter with approximately 23,300 full-time employees, of which about 300 came from acquisitions. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, down from 24% in Q2 and this is mostly because we released certain tax reserves as a result of the settlement of our 2005-2006 tax audits which are now completed.
Let me now turn to cash management. In the line other income and expenses, it was $167 million for Q3, which includes good progress on our portfolio management performance, although that was slightly offset somewhat by the impact of our hedging expenses associated with FASB 133. For more details on OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our investor Website.
Operating cash flow, very strong for the quarter at $2.9 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $757 million, again mostly primarily related to our data center operations, and as a reminder, we continue to make significant investment in CapEx and these have shown to be quite lumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on when we are able to make these investments. So, in the end, free cash flow was also very good at $2.1 billion.
Before I close, I want to say a few words about how we are continuing to grow the business for the long term, and when I say the long term, we really mean not the next quarter or the following quarter, but we are just thinking about the next five to 10 years. Looking ahead, we continue to see tremendous opportunity in our agenda in both our core and in our emerging businesses. So simply put, we are on disclosed agenda at full throttle.
We are doing it largely in two ways to think about it, continue to invest heavily in people and also in products. In people, it’s a pretty simple story, the explosive growth in the digital economy that we are experiencing, it’s really created a war for talent in our industry to digital economy, and one that is quite out of sync with what’s happening in the rest of the economy. So, we believe this trend is only accelerated in the next 18 months and will continue to accelerate. So, in context of that, we stepped up our hiring machine, and we are currently exploring how we can continue to attract and retain the very best people in this exceptionally competitive environment. So, we strongly believe that the difference between the winners and the losers in our industry, although be to a large extent determined by who we can attract and who we can retain the best talent.
So to that end, we are incredibly proud to have attracted approximately 1,500 people to join Google in Q3, the majority in engineering and sales once again. On the products side, our goal continues to be to develop truly innovative products that leverage computer science to solve these incredible problems that we tackle and offer obviously significant ROI across a number of very large growth opportunities. As I mentioned, Jonathan in a few minutes will be speaking of this great momentum our products are experiencing, and as always we are investing with discipline following the Google tradition of being generous but frugal.
So in summary, very pleased with our performance of Q3 across revenue, margins, cash flow, and we plan to continue to attract higher, retain the very best talent in the world wherever they are to fuel our innovation agenda.
Now is the moment for me to turn the call over to Jonathan, which I usually mean that my number parts is over, but today, I have actually asked Jonathan to share with you and let me emphasize on a one-time basis a few products, specific metrics that I think everybody will be very interested to hear. And as the CFO, I am usually the official buzz killer, so I need to make it very clear that we will not be updating these numbers going forward. We are merely sharing them with you as a proof point of the great momentum we are experiencing in our emerging businesses. And with that, let me turn it to Jonathan.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Okay. Well, thanks, Patrick. So, I think you guys can see from the financial numbers, we've got tremendous momentum in the core business. But in these emerging businesses, you guys basically have to invoke your Jedi guesstimation skills to try to figure out what's going on. So today, with Patrick's permission, I hope to shed a bit more light on these businesses with some numbers that we've not shared before.
But let me start with the core. Search is more important than ever. The Internet, as you guys know, continues to explode. There is lots more websites, there is more videos, there is more images, there is more books and news, all of this stuff is coming online. And at the same time, more people are coming online too. And what do these people do when they get online? The first thing they usually do is search.
So search is still at the heart of the web and with all of this new content coming online, doing search well is even harder than ever. I actually believe search remains one of the most challenging computer science problems of our generation and probably the next one as well. This is why we are so incredibly proud of Google Instant. Many of you guys speculated that we launched Instant to make more money. Well, let me tell you that's simply not the case. We launched Instant because it's so much better for the user. In fact, from a revenue standpoint, its impact has been very minimal; and from a resource standpoint, it's actually pretty expensive.
So why did we do it? Well, we believe from a user standpoint, Instant is outstanding and the data that we are seeing actually bears this out. We took something that no one thought was a problem and we created something that once you use it, you can't recall how you lived without it before. It saves about two to five seconds per search and users absolutely love it. The percentage of people who select Instant results before they finish their query is steadily rising. So in other words, that means the more they use it, the more they like it.
So let me be clear that Instant wasn't based on a narrow financial calculation. We launched it because we could and because it's great for our users, as we have always said. Of course, I know it's an earnings call, so let me be clear on another point. We do in fact care about money. And search is still the most monetizable moment on the web and as search gets better, our ads have to keep pace. The good news is they are. Turns out we also have a lot of great momentum with AdWords and this is particularly true with the new ad formats.
On past calls, I've talked about making ads more useful with the new formats like site links and ads with seller ratings and product listing ads, which we think – which we can see now are starting to have a real impact. These ads appear on more than 10% of the queries where we show ads and people like them. We see this because click-through rates are up for some formats as much as 10% and up more than 30% on some others.
We are also seeing great momentum in our newer businesses, and this is where Patrick is letting me give you some big numbers. So, I hope you find them useful. The numbers all begin with the letter B. And remember, as I often remind my team at Google, a billion is a thousand million.
So first big number, $2.5 billion; as in display is on an annualized run rate of over $2.5 billion. So that's non-text display, meaning it doesn't count text ads running on our network. What it does count is YouTube ads, non-text ads on the Google Display Network, and of course on the DoubleClick platform. So you guys often ask me, ""Jonathan, you know, where is the next multibillion dollar business after search""? There is your answer. It's display and it's already here clocking in at over a $2.5 billion run rate.
So clearly, we are firing on all cylinders in display, the advertisers are running great branding campaigns, the Ad Exchange is taking off, we are partnering very well with agencies, and of course more publishers are making more money. And if you want to know more on the display front, Nikesh who is here is passionate about this business. He's made enormous strides with the sales force and clients, which I'm sure he will be happy to talk to you guys about in the Q&A.
So second big number, 2 billion; as in YouTube is monetizing over 2 billion views per week. That's up over 50% year-over-year. And when you think about that growth, it's important because the RPMs are really strong on YouTube. We have just launched some new ad formats called TrueView where the viewers get to choose which commercials to watch or they can even skip watching the ad altogether. Turns out when advertisers only pay for the commercials people watch, we discover the ads are a lot more valuable to advertisers when they are only paying for viewers who have actually chosen to watch them.
Finally, third big number, $1 billion. Mobile is on an annualized run rate of over $1 billion. This means the people who are accessing our products and services through their mobile phones are adding a $1 billion annually to our existing revenue streams. Clearly, this is the future of search in the Internet, more people in more countries coming online from these smartphones. Our mobile search queries have grown five times over the past couple of years. And of course, a lot more of those queries are now coming from Android phones.
So, here are the facts that Patrick has let me say just this once. Non-text display, $2.5 billion run rate; YouTube, 2 billion monetized views per week; and mobile, over a $1 billion added to our business. And Patrick, maybe I'll add one more fact here without asking you. You should know, all these businesses are growing.
So, I hope this gives all of you a sense of why we are so excited about the incredible emerging businesses at Google. And with that, I'll take it back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jonathan. Before we take your questions, I just want to add one fact regarding the new disclosures that Jonathan just gave you. Obviously, this information reflects our revenues from two different angles of our business. And with it, we've recognized in some cases some small overlaps. So for example, the AdMob revenues are obviously included both in the mobile number because it's a mobile product and in display because it's also a display product. So these are very small, but I wish to just clarify it out for everybody.
So with that in mind, what I would like to do is turn it over to Connie to open – and we have Eric with us. So, the ""may"" is now in ""actual,"" Eric is with us, he has got 20 to 30 minutes, then he is running for a plane. So delighted to have you with us, Eric. And what I'll do is I'll turn it to Connie for the Q&A, questions period. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we will pause for just a moment to assemble the queue. And we will take our first question from James Mitchell from Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Great, thank you. I'll ask two separate questions, if I may. The first one, if I look at your paid lead growth, it's been remarkably consistent and not decelerating. I think it was 4% sequentially in the third quarter of 2008, 4% sequentially in the third quarter of 2009, and then 4% sequentially in the third quarter of 2010. Is that because your query growth is also fairly consistent or are you supplementing query growth with monetization initiatives that increase paid lead takeoff?
And then secondly and separately, thank you extremely much for disclosing the billions in terms of mobile and display advertising. But within the $2.5 billion plus of display advertising, how do you account for advertisers spending through the DoubleClick Ad Exchange? Is that on a gross or net basis? Thank you.
Jonathan Rosenberg
I'll try to – I mean, I'll try to take the first question. Certainly the highest correlation between ad clicks and anything else is query growth. So that's going to certainly by far dwarf any other factor.
I think the other factors that we are seeing is that the new formats that we have which I had mentioned certainly drive click growth as well. And I mentioned that those formats appear on 10% of the queries. If you try some of those like, Halloween costumes, you will see that they make the ads much more compelling, as do things like merchant ratings if you type in laser printers. So by improving the ad formats, we are increasing the relative number of clicks because the click-through rates grow up.
Patrick Pichette
Great. On the other one the Ad Exchange is included in – so if you think of the elements, the Ad Exchange, DoubleClick platforms, all these are included in display and it's done on a gross basis.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you for your question. Let's go to the next question, Connie.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
Thanks, and good afternoon. I guess since you guys are sharing some numbers this time, I was just wondering if we can just delve into the YouTube numbers a little bit. Of the 2 billion views, Jonathan, I was wondering what – roughly what percentage of total views is that currently? And then, you guys have talked in the past about getting closer and closer to profitability. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of where you are with respect to profitability as well. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So on profitability, let me jump on that one first which is, we have not made any comments on it. You will remember, we talked about it a long time about ago. Because there was so much distortion in the market, we just thought it was okay to kind of set the clocks properly. But since then, we have not and will not comment on it. On the billions of –
Jonathan Rosenberg
This is Jonathan. So there is basically two points that we've given that you can use to connect those dots. We said that traffic over – that we have over 24 hours of video uploaded every minute and over 2 billion views per day. When you couple that with the 2 million monetized views per week, I think you can get to the answer that you are looking for.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
Great. Thank you very much.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. Let's go to the next question, Connie.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Imran Khan from J.P. Morgan.
Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan
Yes, hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. So I have a question for Eric as he is on the call, and then a follow-up housekeeping question. So Eric, I think the two big trends on the Internet, obviously the web is becoming more social and realtime. So, as the web becomes more social and real time, how does Google compete in that world in terms of realtime search market and how does that impact your business?
And secondly, on the mobile trend, obviously you have this Apple Ecosystem with i – Apple i-applications and people are going directly to applications and how does that impact Google's business model over the long term? And the housekeeping question, near-term question is the tax rate was 20% on the quarter. Is there anything specific in one – this quarter? How should we think about the tax rate? Thank you.
Eric Schmidt
Imran, let me deal your questions as two separate questions for me. With respect to social and realtime, we use complex signals to do ranking. And overtime, we will add additional social, if you will, ranking clues. Fundamentally, we make search more personal and as we get more information the friends are, we can make the search that much better. We are quite convinced that, that produces a better search results for people who choose to give us that information. People who want to continue to do what is there on an anonymous search, that’s also possible. So, one of the ways to think about that is that we want users to be more logged into Google, more logged in they are, more likely we can buy them not only the social information but the other information. We also estimate real time we already have significant feeds from real-time information providers, we have real-time index which of course is very, very successful for us and you can see that whenever anything interesting happens, it’s already right there in Google.
For example, we use Twitter as a real-time source of information. So, if you search for almost anything, you will see the Twitter feed is now part of universal search. Could you repeat the second part of your question for me?
Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan
Second one was, Eric, on the mobile front right, we are seeing explosion on application on mobile platform. So, does that impact your search volume and as people go directly to the vendors to the app, it seems like, you know, Amazon talked about $1 billion sales through coming from mobile devices, so how does that impact Google’s business long-term?
Eric Schmidt
It doesn’t seem to. This is one of those sort of worry work questions that we get all the time, that the success of one thing, could that impinge on something else. And in fact, the rise and tide of all those, and I would say that again, what I hear is the sort of presumption that it’s a zero-sum game and that one wins and another one loses. What’s really happening is that all of the companies that are driving the web and web applications are all doing really well. People are moving from offline to online and in the course of doing that, they are using these systems more, they are searching more, using apps more etcetera.
Now, from our perspective, you have this phenomenal success of Android, which is well past anything that I had ever hoped for and looks like it’s on its way to be a huge, huge success within our devices, devices, open model for access, lots and lots of innovation, more dynamic, more competition than any other part of the platform. There are up to 90,000 applications on Android and have grown very, very fast, and those applications of course have sort of drive to them. So, we don’t see them as a negative, we see both as very strong positive.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Eric. Let me go back then to, coming on to the tax question. We did get a one-time benefit this quarter on the tax side and it is related, as the statutes expired for 2005 and 2006, all of our taxes are now closed and in doing so, then we had an opportunity to reverse a set of provisions we had taken that we ultimately didn’t have to take so. You can see the tax rate this quarter is a bit of an anomaly again.
Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan
Thank you, Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you for your questions. Connie, let’s go for the next question please.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post – Merrill Lynch
Great. Eric, well, we have you, when I get back into mobile, just when you think about Android as an operating system, how does that proprietary to Google when you think about your search services? Does that give you an advantage over other phones for some of your services and does the phone operate better when you are using Google services? And then second, I think you were quoted in an article saying, maybe someday Google can make $10 per phone. Would you see that as mostly advertising and is that number right something you did say? Thank you.
Eric Schmidt
Yes, the latter one I made out of the mirror. So, we don’t really have a notion of exactly what it is, but it’s probably pretty big. So, one way to think about Android is it’s probably the largest single platform play available in the market today. It’s a platform for computation, for location, for everything you could do with the new and most popular set of computing devices that are emerging. That market is larger than the PC market, the tablet market is a small component of it, it’s an important part of it.
So, if you think of mobile as platform, as phone plus tablet, plus all of the other things, we hope to become the leading platform in that space and we are doing it with open source approach. So, in the open source approach, that means we give the software away, which is always paradoxical. People say, well how do you make money from that? Well, let’s start with the fact that the evidence we have is that people who use Android search twice as much as everything else. So, clearly, there is more revenue associated with those searches. And another thing of course is if they are using Android systems, revenue that we share in the search as we shared with operator but not with anybody else. So, again it’s more lucrative. So, not only there are more searches and there is more apps, but it’s also more lucrative.
So, on that basis alone, Android is hugely profitable and we maintain the anti-segmentation and other things by a series of contracts around the store and so forth and so on. So, Android is likely to be financially successful to Google without even any of the applications that are possible. So, Patrick calls up and says, okay, what else can you do for us, and the answer of course is, we can layer on value-added services versus how do you get to the $10. And the value-added services, do you have any time. Our primary purpose right now is building this open platform. Google had chose and they did on open systems and open platform on the open web. That service is well so far and it looks like it’s worked really well.
Justin Post – Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Justin. Connie, let’s go to our next question please.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Mark Mahaney from Citi.
Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
Great, thanks. Two questions on the cost side. It looks like this is the first quarter in about a year-and-a-half, which cost per employee on an annualized basis had declined sequentially. Is there something that you have been able to put in place that gives you confidence that, that will continue going forward? And just on the mobile revenue opportunity, are the results strong enough from your perspective in terms of dollars and growth such that you will stay with an indirect monetization approach towards Android, or you are going to keep the door open and potentially charge per operating system as a share of applications in the future? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
On cost per employee, look, it’s just another reflection of when read anything kind of forward-looking into our results except that it’s just another good example of how we are – I talked earlier about generous but frugal. We are investing, but people should not confuse the fact that we are investing and we are investing aggressively where we really see fantastic opportunities from being wasteful. We are just not a wasteful company. And so in that sense, that’s a good signal and we will continue to do so.
On the mobile, maybe Jonathan or Nikesh can give us an indication.
Nikesh Arora
I think just following up on what Eric said earlier, we are very, very keen to build this ecosystem, and I think Jonathan’s disclosure on the fact that we are on a $1 billion run rate mobile is a testament to the fact that we have a revenue model which we are very excited about, and that revenue model sort of proves to that, roughly the revenues are split between our storage efforts, our display efforts, application efforts, and we are able to play across all those three spaces in our mobile monetization efforts. And the more people who use commercials, more people who are able to access the web devices, the more we see the trend that people that are searching them, they are going to give us opportunities to put display advertising. So, we see no reason to change our monetization model. We think the current approach to Android drives more users and more usage and drives these.
Eric Schmidt
And Nikesh, I think you have already viewed that despite a (inaudible) revenue, because of the success that we are seeing (inaudible).
Patrick Pichette
Exactly. Thank you very much Mark for your questions. Let’s go, Connie, for the next question please.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Douglas Anmuth from Barclays Capital.
Douglas Anmuth – Barclays Capital
Great, thanks for taking the question. First on display, can you give us some context in terms of breaking out (inaudible) and secondly what’s your view on other potentially competitive Android app stores that are out there? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So, I will answer the first, and then I will give Jonathan to talk about the Android marketplaces. So, on display, we just don’t break it down. So, we will not – the details where we wanted to give today with the numbers we are sharing is a sense of scale and trajectory. And that’s really what we wanted to share. So, of course, we won’t give any more details on that. On the Android competitive, of course, Eric, maybe you can give us more perspective on it?
Eric Schmidt
Yes, the goal of the store is to – people who are writing the software and applications, and it’s not a revenue goal for Google. So, there certainly will be multiple stores, there will certainly be the key one from us, taken the net of – and that win for everybody. So, but it’s not a primary focus on Google from a revenue perspective, it’s really for the developers.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Eric. Connie, our next question please.
Operator
And we will go next to Brian Pitz from UBS.
Brian Pitz – UBS
Great, thanks. Would you provide us with a relative idea of how the difference between average CPCs and clicker rates are based on the mobile versus the PC, now that you have a large enough number of devices in the market? And secondly, if there is a gap which I imagine there is, can you close that gap longer term between the two? Thanks.
Jonathan Rosenberg
This is Jonathan, Nikesh can maybe give you more of a customer base perspective. I think that some of you know we recently started smart pricing on the mobile devices, and it is the case that the CPCs on the mobile device are a bit lower. It’s primarily because there is the measurement that there isn’t as much of a consummation of a transaction on the mobile devices. People don’t have their credit cards, and it’s harder to type into them. So, the mobile rates remain relatively lower. As payment platforms get built into the mobile devices and as people are more likely to actually complete the transaction, I think you will see those things go up substantially. I think it's also the case that on devices like the iPad, the kind of activity looks a little bit more like it does on a PC, primarily because people have a larger window, a bigger browser, and they are also more able to input information. Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
I think the only thing I have to add to that is there are some formats which we started to introduce, which are driving a better monetization on the mobile sites, formats like click-to-call and hyper-local, because people are searching in their mobile devices where they want to then make a phone call or they are searching on their devices and they are looking for something in a very local context and there, we are beginning to see sort of better CPMs and better monetization.
Generally, we think that's where the trend is, that's where we are going to see more and more monetization. And clearly, we are seeing monetization in the application side of the mobile, because with the AdMob sort of team that we have and all the advertisers who want to be part of the application, the applications are becoming a big share of people's mobile usage.
Brian Pitz – UBS
Great. Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Brian. Connie, our next question, please?
Operator
And we will take our next question from Ross Sandler from RBC Capital.
Ross Sandler – RBC Capital
Thanks, guys. Two quick questions. First is, you guys have discussed the cannibalization topic before between smartphone and PC, but have you – when you look at the search data, can you see whether tablet searches or iPad searches are incremental or are there any cannibalization towards PC and is the tablet option within AdWords going to be similar to the desktop/laptop option or is it going to be kind of a separate category? And then the cash, can you just give us a little bit more color on the rest of world growth, just in terms of regions that we are driving that 26%. Was it broad-based or was there anything that stood out? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So, we'll let Jonathan answer the first part.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes. We – so we don't see cannibalization. We tend to see mobile is very complementary to the desktop. I think you do see some differences in the search patterns. People use mobile at lunch, they use it on – in the evening, they use it on weekends, they use it more on holidays, but we see more mobile and web search traffic growing and they appear to us to be complementary and not cannibalizing each other.
Patrick Pichette
Nikesh, you want to cover the international growth?
Nikesh Arora
Yes. The U.S. growth was very good for us. I'm very pleased with the way our U.S. team has driven the revenues sort of across the board, across our revenue categories. On the international side, I'd say generally, the trend has been positive across the board. I know the U.K. has been a bit weaker, but there is a bit of currency in there as well. But France, Germany, those markets have actually been very, very robust. I'd say Southern Europe has done way better than some of the Northern European countries, but that's expected because they are enjoying sort of bit of a growth curve. And clearly, some of the Asian markets are growing robustly for us. So, good growth across the board.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Ross, for your question. Connie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank Securities
Great, thanks. A couple of questions. I guess you are on a pace of doing about $30 billion on gross revenue run rate. I guess maybe a different way to look at your business. But what – since it's an ROI-driven model, I guess can you quantify or give us a sense of what kind of gross dollar value of transactions that entails for all the merchants and customers that are participating in the system?
And second, I guess if you look at your competition in mobile or in other company in this space in mobile, they make about $300 in operating profit per handset sold. I guess, do you think this is more the upper bound as it relates to lifetime profit per handset? Do you think it can be higher? I know obviously you are going after a different strategy, but where do you think is the upper bound in terms of the profit potential on a – let's say, to your handset in terms of monetization?
Patrick Pichette
Let me – on the gross value, what – rather than to try to give you more details on this call, Google has actually published some economic data about the amount of value that is actually transacted across the system. And so, I may just refer you back to the IR team that can actually dig that out, because we actually shared that with the public over the last kind of eight months or six months, and it's actually very detailed into how much economic is actually flowing to our systems.
Eric Schmidt
On the handset question – this is Eric – which you asked, I understand the question that you are asking. Our model, remember, is that the handset manufacturers and the operators are going to make a lot of that money. And our model is that, our operating system is free and that we are going to make money from advertising and value-added services on top of the Android platform. So, it's clearly different model.
And so it's not very difficult to compare the two, they are really apples and oranges. It would be I think premature to – for us to estimate what that would be, but if you assume that search monetization on handsets will become equivalent to PCs and then eventually exceed it, which is my personal view, then it should be highly lucrative, because those – the customers that are using Google services, they are going use it more because they are more personal and more targeted. And so ultimately, it should be a very, very strong revenue stream compared to a PC.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Eric. And thank you for your question. Connie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Jason Maynard from Wells Fargo.
Jason Maynard – Wells Fargo
Hi guys, good afternoon. Actually I have a question about social search. I am just curious about how do you capture the signal from social networks without a relationship like you have with Twitter, where you can actually get fairly easy access to the data feeds?
Eric Schmidt
One of things we are careful about is not to describe how our signals are actually assembled. But the answer is that there are some ways in which we can do that. And we also have in development other ways in which people can give us that sort of information that can make it even more personal.
Jason Maynard – Wells Fargo
Okay. And then just maybe a follow-up for Nikesh. When you think about mobile advertising, maybe just sort of help me frame, where do you think advertisers are at in their lifecycle of actually committing dollars to spend in this medium and form factor?
Nikesh Arora
I think the important part to understand on the mobile space is that the reason the billion dollar number is an interesting number is that just means that now the larger advertisers can get more interested, because we can help them spend reasonable amounts of money. It's very hard to go and make a pitch to a large advertiser when the maximum inventory that you can offer them is in the five to 10 or $50,000 range, especially with advertisers who got $100 million or $200 million advertising budgets. So, to get them interested – if they get interested, they would like to be able to deploy reasonable amounts of money against this market.
So, the part I am excited about is that the inventory continues to grow. There is diversity in formats. People are interested in search-based advertising. People are interested in display-based advertising. They want to be in the middle of applications and get customer engagement. So we are seeing sort of reasonable broad-based interest. Clearly, the early adopters are people who can actually consummate a transaction. So, insurance services want a click-to-call, they want to be able to pitch, they want the customer to be able to pick up the phone and call them. There are now people who are in the local space, who want the customer to come to their restaurant. They want the customer to come show up, where they are offering a local service. So, that interest is going up.
Now the retailers who actually are interested when you are looking for a local J. C. Penney or RadioShack that, if we can tell you where it is and they can actually click and find out where it is. So, the interest continues to grow as you look at the local categories, as you look at the click-to-call categories. And as Jonathan said, as payment capabilities start getting bills into the phone, you will start seeing even more of an interest from the e-commerce players.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes. By the way – this is Jonathan. Try typing in some things that will generate the hyper-local feature that we have on mobile search ads. If you try, for example, typing in car rental, there is a very good chance you will see an enterprise rent-a-car ad that tells you how far away it is to your nearest location, half a mile along with the phone number and a link to a map, and I think that will give you a sense of how powerful it is.
Jason Maynard – Wells Fargo
Okay, thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jason. Connie, let's go to our next question.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.
Jason Helfstein – Oppenheimer
Thank you. One of the questions that investors continue to have is ultimately what's the right long-term growth rate to think about for international. Prior to the recession, the company was obviously putting up a very large international growth rate, and we've seen a slowdown and now a rebound. Is there additional color you can give us as far as you think about the long-term opportunities, what they are in the more developing countries and how that's impacting your results internationally? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Because it's guidance – forward-looking guidance, I – we just can't comment. I think that you have to take it from the current performance that you see over the last couple of quarters that there is clearly a separation in the world of economic growth in general and the digital economy growth. And from that I mean, you have to infer that – that's why we are so optimistic about the future of international and we are investing so much in it.
Let's go to the next question, Connie, please.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Youssef Squali from Jefferies.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies
Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, Patrick, your traffic acquisition cost rate seems to be the lowest you had I think since IPO. What accounted for that and is that sustainable going forward? And two, growth in the last few quarters was driven largely by volume not price, so to what extent is that driven by more SCO, less SCN, maybe a mix of domestic versus international, and how realistic is it for us to kind of expect, kind of hockey stick or maybe not hockey stick but reacceleration in pricing trends? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
So, I will take the first question, and then on pricing, Jonathan can probably give you some perspective. On the TAC, it’s very simple. I mean, this quarter, we have had two really factors. One is our MySpace deal is now over, and with it, there was a contract with minimum guarantee and now it has expired. So, that’s one, and then the second one is since the mix of our partners within the network actually will affect our TAC, and that’s really the effect that you see for this quarter. There’s nothing more of us. In terms of forward-looking for volume versus price, Jonathan, any insights or –?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I am not really sure how to answer the question without saying anything forward-looking, is there anything specific use of in terms of trends that you have seen that you are asking for clarification on?
Youssef Squali – Jefferies
Yes, I mean we have been hearing from agencies and advertisers there. They are spending more on SCO, they are getting smarter they have to spend their ad dollars. And so, to the extent that, that continues then that really is putting a dampening effect on CPC growth going forward, the mix between domestic and international should shift to more international and that overtime we should see higher CPCs. I am just trying to kind of see as we look at the business over the next several years, how realistic is to assume that, one i.e., that increased international CPCs will offset the SCO trend?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I guess I don’t actually agree that I have necessarily seen such a trend in terms of more SCO versus SCN. As far as I can tell, SCO has always been pretty big. Pricing has been pretty healthy from my perspective coming out of a recession, bids are healthy. We have got very strong conversion rates, and presumably that’s because the advertisers are seeing buyers again, and the advertisers look at the total value they get from Google, and they are optimizing across everything under purview. So, I am not necessarily sure I agree with the trends the way you have stated them.
Eric Schmidt
It’s interesting that’s going on is that we are continuing to make algorithmic improvements to our app targeting, which flow through the system sort of as the inventions are brought out, we brought out hundreds of them in the quarter, the small ones, but some of them is actually helping drive basically the revenue performance on a per query basis.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies
Okay. Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks. Let’s go for the next question.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Ben Schachter from Macquarie.
Ben Schachter – Macquarie
Hi guys. A few years ago, there was a lot of discussion around callable exclusive data databases, and while yesterday’s deal with Microsoft and Facebook was not exclusive, I wonder if you think that’s going to be a topic that may become more of an issue going forward particularly with Microsoft? And then also just quickly a lot of discussion lately around daily deals and private sales and those kind of things, can Google participate in that in any way? Thanks.
Eric Schmidt
In general, the web continues to grow at such a blazing pace that if you think of all the signals available, I mean, anyone that will be private is completely swamped in the sea of the Internet, and in that sense, it’s not really a relevant question if you think of, what Jonathan would call it petabyte or terabyte or zettabyte. So, from that perspective, I think that we continue to organize the vastness of this and that’s where most of the value construct. So, I think that we are not concerned on that sense.
Patrick Pichette
There’s always a concern that large, private collections of data are not accessible to web search engines. We have teams that have spent an awful lot of time trying to make sure people know that if they optimize, easily crawl their site maps and other services which are standardized among the web search industry. So, it’s obviously up to the content owner to decide how much of that information to expose. We have taken the position to sort of both in a religious and a business perspective that they will do better off if you take information and making it searchable. It provides a lot of audience, it drives more traffic to your site, etcetera, etcetera, and we fundamentally believe that. Jonathan, do you want to take the second?
Jonathan Rosenberg
All right, sure. There is no question, Ben, there is a very exciting space related to daily deals, which we are seeing, and there is obviously a lot of small companies that are doing a fabulous job there. We do participate to some degree, there are some companies that use site links for hot deals. So, there is a mechanism that we already have where advertisers are actually putting in case deals and highlighting them, but there’s no question. That’s a very exciting and hot space, and there are a lot of innovative players building some pretty effective business models there right now.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. Connie, why don’t we go to the next question?

And we will take our next question from Jordan Rohan from Stifel Nicolaus.
Jordan Rohan – Stifel Nicolaus
Couple of follow-up questions on mobile while we are on the subject. I am a big fan of Google Instant, I am wondering when it will be fully rolled out on BlackBerry, iPhone and other devices there? Also curious, if you happen to disclose the number of Android devices activated in the quarter. I think last quarter, it was around 200,000 a day. And finally, instead of smart pricing, and sort of fearing the discount placed on mobile search clicks or calls, why not let advertising just bid directly on the mobile search inventory, you might be surprised about the yield.
Patrick Pichette
On Instant, Jonathan, when is Instant available for all of these mobile devices?
Jonathan Rosenberg
It’s relatively soon, sometime this fall. Fall last a little bit longer in California though.
Patrick Pichette
Okay. Last public number is 200,000 handsets activated a day, and that’s the last number that we have been using. So, we stick to that one for now. And can you just repeat, Jordan, your last question for me?
Jordan Rohan – Stifel Nicolaus
Yes, smart pricing is, as I understand, and maybe I am getting it wrong, but Google has an algorithm which discounts value assigned to advertisers that which advertisers have to pay for certain clicks, if it’s believed that those clicks perhaps are less frequently tied to conversion?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes, they can set up a separate campaign now, so the smart pricing is a convenient mechanism for them. If they want to leverage the existing campaign across mobile, but many advertisers have increasingly set up separate campaigns for mobile.
Jordan Rohan – Stifel Nicolaus
They can right now full visibility there, so that’s how you at some level inform your decisions about smart pricing for the rest of the universe, that access –?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I am not sure, no. The smart pricing is done algorithmically on the basis of what we see. We are not doing it. We don’t necessarily look at differentiation between specific bids across different campaigns.
Jordan Rohan – Stifel Nicolaus
Got it, thank you very much.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jordan. Connie, let’s go to our next question please.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Sandeep Aggarwal from Caris & Company.
Sandeep Aggarwal – Caris & Company
Thanks for taking my questions. Actually, I have two questions. One is, Eric, given that non-core search business is becoming more material part of your business, in the past, you allocated resources, that’s (inaudible) there are shifts in terms of how you are allocating resources now? And secondly, this may imply more of asking a guidance, but I guess my question is, by when do you envision mobile advertising overtaking display advertising?
Eric Schmidt
The latter is a very speculative question and not something that – one, we don't know and two, if we – even if we knew, we probably wouldn't talk about it. On the question of allocation of resources, I think at the end of the day and Larry and Sergey and I have talked about sort of our job to use our best judgment based on the sum of technological opportunity, business opportunity and so forth to divide, if you will, between classic core businesses, you are really asking in some of these emerging ones. So we are informed by the hockey stick nature of these things.
So there is a couple of ones to give you an example of Android, which is small in resources and growing very quickly. So they pretty much have been able to get whatever resources they need and they are going up against very large giants with the factor of 10 more resources, and so we sort of measured it that way. When we then go back and saw for 70-20-10, it turns out that we are roughly consistent with 70-20-10. It's not really as much of a formula, as is much looking at where the real excitement is.
The other thing that we are doing is we are organizing ourselves and Nikesh is actually leading this effort into more of an internal business unit structure, because frankly, it's just become so large and so complicated that it's been difficult for us to keep track of all the details. And so that will give us a better tie-in between where the current and future revenue is and where the resources are going. And I think Nikesh is on the order of 10-15 kind of structure by the time we are done, with the obvious big ones being search and ads and display and enterprise and that kind of stuff, YouTube.
Patrick Pichette
Yes. So and just in closing on that, what really matters the most to us as we actually do the resource allocation is, as Eric said, when you see a hockey stick, pour on gas on that fire and when we do actually and we keep the flexibility to make sure that we really feed the winner so that they keep the momentum as you've seen, for example in Android in the last 24 months, which has been tremendous.
All right. Thank you for your question. Connie, we probably have time for two or three more – two more questions. So let's go for the second last.
Operator
Thank you. And we will go next to Mark May from Needham & Company.
Mark May – Needham & Company
Thanks. A big picture question about data, because that seems to be an increasing factor of differentiation in growth for online ad companies. How does Google think generally about leveraging user data, both to better target ads and how to stay competitive with those like Facebook and Microsoft and Yahoo! that are leveraging data possibly more so than like Google is today? And I think this is particularly relevant for using search data for your display business, but we would love to get your thoughts on that.
Eric Schmidt
We have a pretty strong opinion that we are not going to do very much of it. The reason is that we take our end user data privacy incredibly seriously, and the trust that people have with respect to giving us that information, both their search histories as well as other piece of information, they get very upset very, very quickly if we, in their view, misuse it. So what we typically tell people is we are not going to do the kind of things that you could do with this, like in particular, use it to generate sort of strange apps against your history and things like that without your explicit permission, and we probably in many cases won't do it forever.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Mark. Let's go to our last question, Connie.
Operator
And we will take our final question from Marianne Wolk from Susquehanna.
Marianne Wolk – Susquehanna
Thanks very much. It looks like you did a great job converting a lot of the advertising on the content network over to display. Can you talk about to what extent that's now video-based and is that helping monetization rate significantly? And do you expect that to be sort of a 100% display shortly? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Nikesh, maybe you want to talk about the display and how it's evolving?
Nikesh Arora
I have been waiting for the entire earnings call, Patrick, to talk about display. I am glad that Patrick and Jonathan have allowed us to disclose the run rate of $2.5 billion. I think this puts us in one of the top three display networks in the world. And I also believe that the technology suite we offer is second to none.
So in terms of the video versus the other display formats, it is – primarily a lot of this is still display in terms of banner ads and other formats, and video is beginning to come into it. But we believe in the future there is going to be a lot more rich media involved into display network, because as we go forward you are going to see more and more monetization of video, whether it's on YouTube or other partner sites that's going to happen. So we believe the display network we offer has maximum frequency and maximum reach. We can reach people more times a day than anyone else. So, really excited about display. So, I was not sure what you meant by what becomes 100% of display?
Marianne Wolk – Susquehanna
I'm sorry, but of the sort of roughly 1 million partners that are part of the partner network, to what extent is that now converted to display and could that ultimately be entirely part – entirely display network? And then also, just since I've got you, can you clarify the run rate information you gave? Is that a trailing 12-month figure or are you annualizing the current quarter? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora
Yes. So, I'll let Patrick answer the – (inaudible) on $2.5 billion dollars. But in terms of the million partners we have, the entire partner network is part of our display network that we offer and we actually have the ability to offer them display advertising or text-based advertising, and basically it's based on ROI and CPMs that we make that determination or the publisher makes the determination or the advertisers make the determination. So an entire network that we have is open for display advertising already.
Patrick Pichette
And on the previous question – on the follow-up question, it was about – it's just the trailing quarter. So with that, thank you for your question, Marianne.
Let me give you a couple of thoughts. One is, just want to reiterate that what we did today was give you a few indications of why we believe we are successful in these emerging businesses. These data points are not about giving you more information on the coming quarters, but more to give you the confidence about where we are investing and it's really fueling great growth rates and building meaningful businesses.
I want to thank you Eric for taking the time. I know he is running for the plane, but it's terrific to have you on the call and take a few minutes with our analysts and shareholders. And then I also want to take a moment to thank all the Googlers for their hard work. I mean, all this strong performance is really on the back of fantastic work from our team worldwide, our great engineers, our great sales force, and our great support staff everywhere. So I just wanted to take from the OC, 40 just the time to thank them again on – in the public domain, because they do such a terrific job.
With that, Connie, I'll let you close the call.

Good day and welcome, everyone, to the Google Inc. conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jane Penner, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma’am.
Jane Penner
Thank you, Connie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today’s second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, Product Management; and Nikesh Arora, President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development.
First, Jonathan and Patrick will provide us with their thoughts on the quarter and then Nikesh will join us to answer your question.
Also, as you know last quarter we began distributing our earnings release exclusively through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So, going forward, please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as supplementary slides that accompany the calls. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours.
Now let me now quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google’s future and investments in our long term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please not that these forward-looking statement reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call such as operating profit and operating margin are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As Jane mentioned, Jonathan and I will begin with the prepared remarks, but we also have Nikesh with us for the Q&A. So, let me start you by giving some high-level thoughts about the quarter and then we will get into our detailed financial performance.
So, overall we are very pleased with our Q2 results. We experienced continued solid growth in our core, but also very strong growth in our emerging businesses year-over-year. Taking a step back actually, these results reflect a few really important trends in the digital advertising. First, we are really taking notice that more and more traditional brand advertisers are embracing search and search advertising is a way to build their brands online. A case in point P&G, it’s one of the largest brand advertisers in the world. And it’s now one of our top advertisers in the U.S.
Second, we see also a real trend in large advertising, focusing on highly measurable but also integrated campaigns across display, mobile and search. So, as a result, we saw strength in every major product in Q3. Google.com was strong with strong performance across major geographies and most major verticals, including CPG, retail, travel, et cetera.
Our growth in display was also very strong. Our continued focus in this product area is clearly generating results. Our display network, which includes YouTube, is growing very rapidly. The scale and quality of our network continues to increase and we see increased demand from traditional brand advertisers in that space as well. In addition, we made yet another significant stride in display this week, when we entered into a strategic agreement with Omnicom Media Group. We will be working together with Omnicom to co-develop their exchange trading desk for the double click ad exchange in the coming years.
YouTube specifically we continue to see very impressive growth as brand advertisers also consider it a must-buy. For example, and as I mentioned a moment ago, in Q2 we ran World Cup advertising campaigns for major advertisers of the likes of Coke, Visa, Nike, Sony, et cetera.
Finally, on YouTube, I think it’s really worth noting that we are very pleased of course with the court’s decision to rule in our favor in the Viacom case. But more important in this victory, it’s not for us, but for the users and just the Web in general. Specifically for all the blogs and the community forms across the Web that do rely on this user-generated content for sharing information and also for free expression. Look, we were very passionate about this issue at Google and so much so that we have made significant investment of approximately $100 million to win this case. And once again, it just was the right thing to do and we did it.
In mobile, our revenue continues to grow as advertiser increasingly opt into their mobile-specific campaigns, and with the successful completion of the AdMob transaction in Q2, our business is gaining momentum. And so we have a very competitive mobile advertising platform now. And of course, underpinning our growth is the success of the Android platform itself with over, as we announced a couple of weeks ago, 160,000 devices activated daily. That’s two every second. And it creates an even larger base of data-centric smart phone users.
Finally, enterprise had another good quarter with several high-profile deals, including, for example, Virgin America. The world is simply moving into the cloud.
And successful products do require investment. And that’s why we are focusing our resources on products that, as you all know, leverage computer science to solve our big problems, offer great ROIs, and very large growth opportunities. For example, in Q2 we’ve added approximately 1200 employees. That’s obviously counting the acquisitions of AdMobs and the others. But the majority is done in engineering and sales and in the following product areas: search monetization, display, mobile, apps, all the next billion dollar businesses that are growing incredibly rapidly. And that’s why we are investing in them.
Jonathan will give you more details about that in a moment. So, now let me turn to our financial results. Gross revenue. Gross revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $6.8 billion. Our Google website’s revenue was also up 23% year-over-year to $4.5 billion, with strength, as I mentioned, across most geographies and verticals. Our AdSense revenue was up 23% as well to $2.1 billion, reflecting our continued strength specifically in the Google display network.
Other revenue was up also 39% year-over-year to $258 million. And it includes the last quarter of revenue from the sale of Nexus One. As announced, we are discontinuing the direct-to-consumer channel in Q3, and as a result beyond Q3 we won't recognize any revenue or cost associated with the sale of Nexus Ones. They are still being sold through various carrier partners, both in the U.S. and Europe, however.
Our global aggregate paid click growth remain quite healthy, up 15% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter due to the typical summer seasonality. Aggregate cost per click growth was up 4% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Note that the FX had a positive effect on our CPC growth year-over-year and a negative one quarter-over-quarter. Remember too that this is an aggregate number and it includes both Google.com and our AdSense properties.
Turning now to our geographic performance, on a relative basis the U.K. lagged a bit the global economic recovery, certainly relative to the U.S. and rest of the world, which were strong. Revenue from the U.S. was up 26% year-over-year to $3.3 billion and in our earnings slide you will find on our investor website you will see that we have broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and Rest of the World to show you the impact of the FX and benefits from our hedging programs. So, please refer to these slides for these calculations.
International revenue accounted for 52% of our total revenue or $3.58 billion, up 21% year-over-year, which includes $79 million benefits from our hedging programs. This is compared to $124 million of benefits in Q2 of last year. If we used fixed exchange rates, our international revenue would have been roughly $24 million lower year-over-year. The U.K. was up 8% year-over-year to $770 million.
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition cost were $1.7 billion or 26% of our total advertising revenue. Our cost of revenue was $735 million, including stock-based compensation of $8 million and also expenses related to the sale of the Nexus One. And finally, all operating expenses totaled $2 billion. This is also including $301 million of stock-based compensation. The increase in year-over-year OpEx is really primarily due to increases in payroll, professional services and advertising and promotional spend.
So, the result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock-based compensation increased to $2.7 billion in Q2 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 39%, essentially the same as last year. As I mentioned already, our headcount was up approximately 1200 heads versus Q1 and in the quarter were 21,805 full-time employees and again that reflects the acquisitions as well.
Our effective tax rate was up to 24% in Q2 versus 22% in Q1 essentially due to the mix of earnings between domestic and international subsidiary and the impact of our hedging program.
Let me quickly turn to cash management. Other income and expense was 69% for Q2 – $69 million, sorry, for Q2, which includes good progress in our portfolio management performance, although it was somewhat offset by the impact of our hedging expenses with FASB 133. For more detail on the OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call in our IR website.
In addition, we’ve announced today a $3 billion commercial paper program and a related credit facility. This to us is an important step in establishing a more capital-efficient structure that will provide us with low-cost working capital availability and flexibility and it’s also an excellent time to do it given the historical low interest rates.
Operating cash flow was very strong at $2.1 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $476 million. Again, primarily related to our data center operations, and as a reminder, we continue to make significant CapEx investments and it just turn out to be lumpy from quarter to quarter. Our free cash flow, therefore, stands at $1.6 billion in a very good position.
So, if you take a step back from all these numbers, here is where we stand. We are very pleased with our Q2 performance seeing growth across revenue, margin, and cash flow. And it really paints a picture where we are very confident of our future. And that’s why we continue to attract and hire among the best talent in the world to further invest in our growth agenda.
So, with that, and before we open up for questions, let me turn over to Jonathan for his comments. Jonathan?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Okay, well, thanks, Patrick. So, let me start with search. Search used to be pretty simple. You would enter a query and we would return a bunch of links to websites. But now, the Web is much, much more complicated. There is videos, there is books, there is music, there is news, just about any type of media you can name is online. So the scale of the Web now is grand and it isn’t slowing down. To keep pace, we migrated a whole lot of our index to a new infrastructure, which we call Caffeine. And Caffeine is basically a new way of updating our index. So now when we find a new web page or new information like a video or an image, we add them straight to the index without a new delay. This means that the results that you get are a lot fresher and in fact they are about 50% fresher than before.
But then, once you get your results, you need tools to work with them to get to the right answer. And we’ve launched a new UI that has a bunch of options on the left hand side to help you filter those results. I especially like the timeline feature, which I think is great when you are doing research and you want to see results from a particular time. So, you can enter, say, oil spill, and click on timeline and 1969 and you can read all about the big Santa Barbara spill that led to the ban on offshore drilling in California.
On the other hand, sometimes, you just want an answer. The query is effectively the result and we are getting much better at knowing when that’s the case and giving you what you need. So, enter, for example, Barack Obama birthday and you will see what I mean. You will see his birthday listed, August 4th, 1961, and citations for the different sources where we got that information. All of this works in suggest too. Try typing capital South Africa. By the time you get to the first ‘a’ in Africa, we tell you it’s Pretoria.
I point out these things out because the great things about features like these is most people I think don’t even notice the changes. They just notice that they get their answers fast. I think I mentioned on the earnings call back in January that we a working on putting more wood behind fewer arrows. And Search innovation is definitely one of those arrows. Our case here is actually accelerating. Voice search added six languages. We launches spelling full page replacement, suggest with spell correction, and over 100 quality enhancements. So there is lots of stuff going on. In fact there is so much that we are putting out a weekly blog post to document all the search improvements.
But, interestingly, as search gets better, it actually creates another huge challenge for us. The ads need to keep pace and get better too. Otherwise what would happen is people will click on relatively fewer ads and that will be bad. So, this dynamic were consumers are in control holds for all types of media and not just search. It used to be consumers had to watch, see, or listen to whatever the advertiser wanted to show, but now they don’t. I think this is a fundamental shift for the advertising industry.
When people don’t have to watch your ads, what do you do? Well, you have to make ads people actually want to watch. I was in Piazza San Marco in Venice a couple of weeks ago and there was this huge billboard advertising a ski jacket. It was like 90 degrees and we were sweating in shorts and tee shirts. And I looked and I thought, “What a waste of money.” So I took a photo of the ad with my smartphone and I sent it to my team as proof there is lots of upside in improving ads. And this quarter, we made progress on that upside. We added new ad formats, and we focused even more on quality. The new formats lead advertisers put more useful information into their ads such as pictures of a product or a local address or a phone number. It turns out that when you are searching for something from your phone, you are much more likely to click on the ad which has a phone address in it. This seems obvious, but now we actually know from the data that it’s true. One of our customers, Carnival Cruises increased bookings from mobile phones by 175% when they included click to call ads.
Lastly on ads, I know you often ask about quality. And I am proud to say we had one of our most productive quarters there in the last couple of years. Over a dozen launches on search with a strong impact on revenue. We did things like put better ads on the second page of results where we realized that the ads weren’t as good. And we also had over 20 quality improvements on the Google display network.
Display, by the way, is going very well. One recent development is that we are working closely with our agency partners to help them move to what they call an audience buying model. And I think this is another fundamental shift in advertising where the ultimate goal is to designate a particular audience on our network like say women between 18 and 35 who like basketball. And we automatically target that audience for you.
We are also making progress with features like remarketing, which we launched last quarter. Advertisers can reach people who have already visited their sites. Interest based advertising, which we launched last year is also working very well. And so is the double click ad exchange, which we launched in Q3. We’ve got several of the top ad networks on it and we are tracking some big buyers like agency holding companies. Advertisers really like the technology, which is real-time bidding and publishers like that it’s open to all advertisers and ad networks who they want to work with.
We want to be open in everything we do. We believe open systems are better for the Web, they are better for competition. They are better for the user. This is not philanthropy. When the Web is better, more people use it more often. And that means they search more often. Android is a leading example of this. As Patrick mentioned, we are now activating over 160,000 Android devices every day. This is up from 65,000 last quarter. What’s even more interesting there is that most of these devices are developed completely independently off Google. One of those is the Spring EVO, which is actually my favorite phone right now. Has a big screen, it’s got great video. It acts as a WiFi hotspot for me. It has 4G bandwidth at least when you are around Mountain View.
The Android market is also open of course, and now has over 70,000 apps. That was around 30,000 in April. As you look at all these new apps being created you also realize that your mobile phone is no loner [ph] anymore. It’s actually connected to several million computers 24/7. This is leading us do things that we used to think were impossible.
We just released the new version of Goggles, that lets you take a picture of something in another language with your phone and it translates it for you. I actually use this a lot to read menus on my vacation in Italy. You literally don’t have to guess what you are going to eat any more. Or say you want to know [ph] about how the locals are celebrating their World Cup victory – congratulations to Spain, by the way. Anyway, you just go to elpais.com and Chrome toolbar automatically translates it for you in a second.
So, cloud computing also means that enterprises can take advantage of these innovations. We just launched this feature where if you have say a PDF or the image of a scanned document, you can upload it to Docs and we’ll convert it to text, so you can edit it. You don’t have to install any special software or anything. If you are a Google apps customer, it’s just there and it works. Of course, the cloud is pretty good for wasting time too. I hope you played with our special Pac-Man doodle. We put it on May 22nd to celebrate Pac-Man’s 30th birthday and we estimate people spent 4.8 million hours playing it. If you missed it, go to google.com/pacman. Gloop, gloop, gloop. Thank you for your time. Back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jonathan. And, yes, there were these great reports of billions of billions of kind of productivity lost over that little Pac-Man, so obviously we did something right somewhere. Connie, can you actually turn on the Q&A process and I am going to invite the guests also join us at this time.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator instructions) And we’ll take our first question from James Mitchell from Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much and thank you for the Pac-Man distraction a few weeks here. My question was about the sequential increase in operating expenses. I was wondering if there was any adjustments (inaudible) rules that went into that sequential increase or was it entirely due to headcount additions and acquisitions and marketing.
Patrick Pichette
It – the bonus accrual would have a small impact on it, so it is really about headcount, about TVCs, about marketing.
James Mitchell – Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
You’re welcome.
Jane Penner
We are ready for the next question.
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
Thanks. Good afternoon. Two quick questions. First, in terms of the paid click growth of 15%, I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of how much of that is coming from mobile today currently versus say last quarter?
And then the second question maybe Patrick, just on TAC, it was down a little bit year-over-year and [ph] sequentially. Can you just give us a sense of where you think on a percentage basis that’s trending especially with the MySpace deal coming up shortly? Thank you.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes, this is Jonathan on the mobile question. Mobile is certainly growing faster than other clicks, so everything else being constant, there is a disproportionately larger group of mobile clicks this quarter than in quarters in the past, but we don’t really have any more detail on that.
Patrick Pichette
In the case of TAC, it’s been – I mean most of the TAC that we have today because as you said so rightly that MySpace deal in pending now. I mean we shouldn’t see any – there is no big jump anywhere in the TAC going forward. And it’s been pretty stable actually around – I think you said 27% or – ? And so there is very little variability in it.
Spencer Wang – Credit Suisse
Great. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Spencer.
Jane Penner
I think we are ready for the next question.
Operator
And we’ll go next to Imran Khan from JPMorgan.
Imran Khan – JPMorgan
Yes, hi, thank you so much for taking the questions. Two quick questions. One, the 1200 or so headcount increase. Could you give us some sense like where are you allocating those headcount either in search or in the new – most of the headcounts are going to new initiatives?
And also secondly, in terms of the cost per click, can you give us some sense the differences of cost per click, mobile versus desktop and how quickly you think it can narrow? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Great. So, why don’t I start with the 1200? So, remember 1200 just a bit of a clarification, there is probably around 300 of those 1200 that in estimates that come from M&A. So, really kind of organically if you think about it, more like 900, which was not unlike last quarter. The – as I mentioned in my core notes, Imran, the – most of the headcount is in engineering and sales. And most of the headcount like the vast majority is going to the four core areas of focus of the company. So they are about search and search monetization. They are going to mobile and Android. They are going to apps. And they are going to display. We see so much momentum in each of these right now, but that’s where the bulk of the resources are going because that’s where the focus of the company is. On the CPC, Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
On the CPC – hi, this is Nikesh – on the CPC, I don’t think there is enough data for us to actually look at a trend in terms of where it’s closing or not, but you have to understand the mobile advertiser sees mobile as a very different platform vis-à-vis the desktop advertiser. And you see high CPCs where there are transactions that can be consummated in the mobile, i.e., in digital entertainment. You don’t see as high CPCs as when you are trying to give directions to a certain restaurant or a place where they might (inaudible). So, there is still some disparity between the CPCs in the desktop and mobile. And within mobile, depending on the verticals, there is disparity depending on the type of advertiser.

And we’ll take our next question from Justin Post from Bank of America.
Justin Post – Bank of America
Great. My questions are about Android. Can you talk about how much investment is going into that platform? And then how do you think about it? Is this an investment that just needs to keep going, just you compete in the mobile market or – you know you are not charging for it, is this a real installed base revenue opportunity and we are going to start hearing more communication about how you are going to monetize it down the road? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Okay, so let me give you a high-level answer to kind of give everybody comfort, right. Android is not, in terms of cost, it’s not material to the company, and not only that, but let me give you a further kind of proof point of the value of Android is. Some of the key products that have been launched over the last few weeks and few months have not been developed by Google at all. I think that the last Android X or the Motorola, what is it Droid X has been developed by the – by Motorola directly with Verizon and not involving any of the Google resource. So, it’s not a huge resource investment. It’s a formidable return in that what you have is the entire ecosystem exploding. And (inaudible) and give you really the sense of that one. So from the cost side it’s not material. Jonathan.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes, and we gave some data just on the scope of the numbers, the 160,000 Android devices as well as the growth in apps from 30,000 to 70,000, but I think the most important most obvious thing to think about from our perspective is what’s the most popular app on these devices. The most popular app is a browser. And what do people do with the browser on these devices? They search an order of magnitude more than they have on any previous type of smartphones, which they had in years past. So, the combination of people browsing on these smartphones connected on very, very fast networks, and searching on them is basically the formula around how Google makes, how Google succeeds.
Justin Post – Bank of America
I don’t know if you are taking a follow-up, but I mean are you seeing search activity really strong on mobile devices with Android and do you think you are losing any ground relative to search activity within applications? Thank you.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Android search grew 300% in the first half of 2010. So, yes, search on Android devices is exploding.
Patrick Pichette
I think that – another way to kind of frame it in numerical numbers I mean the mobile has grown 500% in the last two years in terms of the traffic, so think of that and then think of Android being an accelerator of that because every time you bring the NPV of all these platforms coming forward, you get a lot more. So, that’s how to think about the problem and the solution that we bring.

And we’ll take our next question from Doug Anmuth from Barclays Capital.
Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two things I wanted to ask, first, just on the macro environment, can you comment on what you saw at all during 2Q in terms of whether the environment seem to change at all either in the U.S. or Europe and then secondly, just given the $3 billion commercial paper program and can you update your current thoughts on returning cash potentially to shareholders? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Okay. Let me start with the last one first. I mean really the commercial paper is a fantastic opportunity for us given the portfolio that we’ve put in place for our cash to actually have the working capital flexibility around it. So, now if I need in fact working capital for my day to day operations, I have that flexibility through commercial paper and that’s really the essence of what we are doing. We have made no decisions at all on share buybacks or as I said to everyone, we – it’s a topic that is regularly debated, brought to the Board for debate and we have nothing to announce on that one.
On the macro side, I would say, look there is kind of two things, right. Everybody reads the press; everybody has been seeing all everything that happened in Q2, the Europe, the that, this or that. I mean for us at Google, it’s been a great quarter. We’ve had – our business has been a great quarter and we’ve seen no impact of what’s going on in the macro world to us. And that’s why we said for the last three, four quarters we’ve said we are really kind of performing in this kind of economy and that’s why we feel confident about the future and feel confident about investing now. And that’s why we are doing it.
Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital
If I can just follow-up quickly on the first one on cash, can you comment on how much of your cash is international versus in the U.S.?

And we’ll go next to Brian Pitz from UBS.
Brian Pitz – UBS
Great. Thanks. Would you talk about your advertise and user adoption of some of the new product ad formats that we are actually seeing on your site? Are these ads having material impact on CPC because we understand they are (inaudible) basis? Thanks
Jonathan Rosenberg
This is Jonathan, I can give you a quick review of the top format and then maybe Nikesh can chime in and give you a sense of some of the specific customer experiences that he has had. The click to call ads on the high end mobile phones are doing very well. The click through rates go up 6% when you put ads with a phone number, 8% when you put a local address. So, click to call is doing very well. It’s easy to see some of those. If you want, just take a look for yourself if you tried travel agency from a smartphone, you will see under thousands of active campaigns on click to call, so you can take a look at that.
Site links is also making pretty good progress. We’ve given you examples on past calls where you type a big brand like Sears and then you see the more useful links that you can get through and the click through rates on those can go up as much as 30% over the ads without the site links. But we changed the way we do site links and we’ve added a new one line format. And that also allow site links to show up in more places. You can try flowers if you want to see that. Then the other format that’s getting some adoption is the – we are adding the seller ratings, which shows merchants ratings out of six stars aggregated from reviews on the Web. You see that if you look for things like digital cameras. And that’s doing pretty well as well.
Patrick Pichette
Nikesh, any further thought?
Nikesh Arora
No, I guess from an advertise perspective they have always had a sense that over the last few years we’ve actually had some disparity in the quality of our natural search and quality of our ads, things like site links create tremendous parity between what people get in natural search and what they get in from an ad format. So, there is tremendous appetite on our large advertisers to be able to send their consumers or users to a deeper part of the website with site links and all. So, the adoption of site links, the adoption of click to call as Jonathan is extremely sort of more lucrative for them because they can actually track it and they can actually track the transaction that it creates. So, these – the ad formats are definitely helping and are getting out there. One thing what Jonathan did not touch upon is the ad innovation on the display side as well. Now, we’ve had tremendous new formats we’ve launched in the whole YouTube front where we’ve actually increased the inventory because we get more and more content where we can show ads on. In addition to that we also have new ad formats which effectively – I mean imagine a basic add and now getting it to be an auto expandable (inaudible) which shows up on YouTube, which allows us to impact the pricing of the ad format. So the more richer the ad, the more an advertiser is willing to contribute because it creates a more engaging experience and therefore a higher opportunity. So, I think across the board the new ad formats are both – we are seeing more appetite for them and at the same time they are allowing us to create more return for the advertiser, allowing us to price them better.
Jane Penner

And we’ll take our next question from Ross Sandler from RBC Capital Markets.
Ross Sandler – RBC Capital Markets
Hi, just two quick questions. Patrick, you said that cost for Android are fairly immaterial, so can you talk about the operating margin in the display business on a revenue ex-PAC basis? How much was the margin that you are seeing right now coming from display growing faster than search.
And then second question is it looks like the ROW region accelerated a bit in the second quarter if you strip out the hedging and currency impact. Can you talk about, Nikesh, which regions are driving that and can you – talk about the environment in Europe given the macro – I know you talked about it for a second earlier, but just any further color about continental Europe? Thanks
Nikesh Arora
I mean it’s – the display business has you know to a certain extent if you take it as a blended slightly lower margins if you take the double click platform, for example, which is more transactional. But overall I think that they still are quite healthy and they don’t – if you think of CPCs the way I think about them is you have really kind of two big components at work. The innovations that Jonathan talked about that actually drive CPC up and then because those products perform better, they add pressure to the auction, and therefore drive CPC up. And then the two or three components that actually drive them down in the short term, it’s not as much display as the places like Brazil and India that are growing very well so internationally. And because they don’t have a strong an auction right now, right, the CPCs are slightly lower, but they are growing so that’s positive and then we already talked about mobile themselves as being lower CPCs. These are the two that actually are growing incredibly rapidly in that, on the mix in the short-term, they kind of put a bit of a downward spin on the CPC formula. But both of them as we know, they are growing one rapidly, so it’s real dollar net in and then on top of that we know there is going to be future pressure on them. So I am pretty pleased about the performance of those.
On the issue of Europe and FX and it’s really to – everybody has got a model out there, right. We’ve lived an incredible roller coaster of FX over the last year so if you look at currencies like the euro and the pound, right, they were kind of quite similar on par versus year-over-year but the last quarter versus this quarter a huge change. And then in addition to that, if you look at places like the real in Brazil, the Canadian dollar, the yen, I mean those have quite increased year-over-year. So, when you do your models relative to FX OI&E just take into consideration the fact that year-over-year the net-net position is it’s been strengthening all-in. Quarter over quarter it’s been going down all-in and then on top of that our FX kind of our hedging program is really a long term hedging program. So this quarter we’ve reaped 78 million, 79 million of benefits net. So it’s a tough puzzle to solve. But just please take the time to look at year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter because it’s a puzzle to build. I hope that answers your question.

And we’ll take our next question from Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
Great. Two questions. I guess do you think that Android and mobile represents a bit of a defensive strategy since you kind of pride yourself on the lack of cost in that business as a whole and the same time you are adding headcount as a whole in the company?
And then second, I guess just curious, yes, the feedback we keep getting in the industry is that the Android kind of infrastructure and support seems to be lower than what at least your ecosystem would like. I guess do you – what is the appetite to create other revenue streams outside of advertising inside let’s say mobile in the form of let’s say an app marketplace that is pretty vibrant? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
So, let me just give kind of the highest level answer is it’s – the answer is yes. I mean obviously having – we did for offensive reasons, not defensive reasons, right. We believe that actually open platform that create the ecosystem where developers can actually create a whole set of new generations of apps is incredibly important and in addition to that right we do know that these new formats like the smart phones create an entire new set of activities in which you live and you will search and you will transact. So from that perspective, I think that it’s obviously both. I think that – I take your comment that if the market in general is saying do you want more support from us in that space, right, we are investing heavily because we believe, one, that search advertising or acquisition of AdMob by the investments we are making is because for us advertising is completely nascent in this space relative to kind of text search an then second is we ourselves are doing a lot of innovation through cloud computing and others to actually create a whole new generation of apps ourselves. So I think that, yes, defensive, yes, offensive, but in the end benefiting everybody and I am glad to hear that you say you want us to invest more in it.
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
Why it seems like your handset vendors are aggressively investing and we haven’t seen it from your side at least as we talked to some of your partners out there and I guess it seems like do you think that other models outside of advertising need to be explored at this point? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
I am not sure I understand you question. Other models such as what?
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank
Oh, let’s say consumer applications, so there are other companies that have created business models around obviously game downloads app, other app downloads that are charged. Obviously you have as well, but it seems like you are—you seem to be maybe it’s early days, but still early in that development.
Patrick Pichette
I think you are absolutely right that it is early days and I think that the 70,000 apps that we have is actually a demonstration of the effervescence of that ecosystem that’s actually just building now.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes, I think one – this is Jonathan. I mean it is at a very nascent stage. I think we also – there is a lot more infrastructure that needs to be built to support a lot of the commerce. You know we substantially need to improve the billing capabilities in the market and that’s obviously one of the things that we are investing in pretty aggressively, but I don’t think of this as defensive at all. I mean there is a huge opportunity for incremental usage of search as I talked about earlier and when we see an opportunity for people searching more, that’s obviously something that we want to participate in. So we see this platform is winning. We think that gives us an opportunity to build the mobile Internet and we think that in the long run that’s going to be good for Google, it’s going to be good for the applications developers and it’s going to be good for consumers, so we are investing in building that wining platform.

Steve Weinstein – Pacific Crest
Great. Thank you. I was hoping you can help explain some of the movement in the P&L expense. You mentioned that most of the hiring is going into engineering and marketing. When I look at the sequential increase in – by dollars kind of expensive – you just had a large increase in G&A about 48 million sequentially and that’s compared to one like $20 million in sales and marketing. So, can you explain a little bit more? Was there anything in the G&A line that is one-time or not repeatable, why are they moving like that?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, you have to look at – there is a couple of things. One is our recruiting – as you go year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, we had kind of three big elements, one is we had our recruiting machine that started to build last year was not built in Q2 of last year, so – if you think of the hiring infrastructure and the people infrastructure has actually been kind of – been building and now you see the full flow through. We also have had in G&A in general another area. If you think of everything else that’s kind of people, we’ve talked about legal. We’ve had a number of legal costs to this quarter that have also flowed through just because of a number of legal activities that we’ve taken. So, these are the two biggest components that actually would explain the big variances.

Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
Thank you. Two questions please. A year ago, you talked about being close to profitability on YouTube given all the momentum that you’ve seen over the last year. Do you feel like you are a lot closer, are you profitable with the YouTube asset?
And the secondly, when you sell display ads, do you feel like you are selling them to existing search customers? Do you think – or do you think that it’s opened up a significantly larger customer pool or a mix of those two? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
So, let me talk about profitability, but Nikesh will have the answer to your second on display. Look, we don’t comment on YouTube. What I can tell you is we are incredibly pleased by its trajectory. I mean YouTube is – you take a step back, it’s two billion views per day in its fifth year of existence. It’s won over a billion monetization videos per week. It’s a huge kind of a first page and it’s aggregating audiences and you see it today to the top brand advertiser is showing up for it, right. So on the World Cup you saw the Sonys and the Cokes and the – I mean this is the power of YouTube today. It’s like a worldwide audience. So, in that sense I would argue just read in the TVs [ph], it’s a great business for us.
On the display side, Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
Yes, just to add to what Patrick said, to be fair, what display and YouTube has given us it’s allowed us in the case of large search customers to complement the portfolio in terms of being able to offer integrated campaigns, which go all the way from branded sites like YouTube to networks like the Google Display Network and to be able to sort of co-mingle lab research. Not only that many advertisers now actually co-mingle that with television ads as well as their print programs. So you see a much more integrated campaign capability that begins to happen. Here we got examples recently like Patrick mentioned in the Sony folks organ [ph] at the World Cup. What’s interesting is Procter and Gamble has become one of our larger advertisers this quarter. That’s primarily driven by the ability of CBG companies to both see the value of search in their ability to build a brand where they figured out that people research online and – sorry, research – yes, research online and purchase offline; we just call it the ROPO effect. People like P&G are beginning to see that impact. Other consumer companies are beginning to see that impact.
In addition to that we are seeing like Patrick mentioned the Omnicom deal, which we just announced, agencies are beginning to realize that this is an integrated buy. This is a buy you need to do across multiple properties not just YouTube, the Google Display Network and the search network hence the notion of trying to create a trading desk not just with people like Omnicom, but we have deals in places, Publicis and Roopan [ph] et cetera as well.

Yes, hi, thanks. Can you comment on Android/Chrome as an operating system? So when we think about Android in and of itself on a mobile device or on a particularly on like a cell phone, we can see kind of the revenue opportunity over time with ads and – basically on apps. When you think about Android or Chrome as perhaps an operating system for tablets or for computers, is there ever a revenue opportunity in the software of shall we think of it the same way as we think about Android today? Thanks.
Jonathan Rosenberg
I think – this is Jonathan – I think it’s probably too early to answer that question. You know I think we are mostly focused with Android on building out the platform on getting more smart phones out. And on the Chrome side, we are – it’s still too early to say.

Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley
Hi, thanks for taking the question. Regarding paid clicks up 15% year-over-year, it’s been pretty consistently in the teens for almost two years now. I was wondering if you can just talk about may be the top three or four drivers that’s keeping that rate at such robust levels for such an extended period of time? Thank you.
Jonathan Rosenberg
This is Jonathan. I think the biggest thing is just the continued secular shift in advertising from things offline that are not measurable to the ROI-based model of search advertising where the advertisers can actually see the benefits and the ROI that they are receiving on the money that they are spending. We did see a good bit of that during the recession. I think there was a disproportionate fraction of budgets that were spent on things were the ROI can be tracked.
I think on our side we are doing a lot in terms of ads quality, as I mentioned, in my scripted remarks. And I think the ad format efforts that both Nikesh and I talked about also serve to increasingly drive clicks.
Nikesh Arora
You know, I – just to complement this, I think that we have seen in fact I would argue the paid clicks move quite a bit over the last couple of years in response to the recession. We have seen that and we’ve seen a great recovery in Q1 and Q2 and on a year-over-year basis. I think that for us what’s really interesting is people are searching, people are – secular trends as Jonathan said are happening and because people are searching, people are clicking and the quality of the ad network and the products themselves continue to improve. I mean we just see the symbiotic relationship happening.

And we’ll go next to Youssef Squali from Jefferies.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies
Thank you very much. Two quick questions I guess this is for Patrick. Patrick, as you look at your business needs for the next couple of quarters, do you think that your level of hiring and your level of CapEx which this quarter has doubled from the prior quarter is sustainable, is it at the level you need to get to where you want to get to? And second what are your views on contextual searches that have been implemented by the other search competitors and which at least on the surface seems to have you guys losing some market share? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
So, let me – I will let Jonathan talk about contextual search in detail. On the issue of market share, just the kind of give the highest level answer, I mean there has been a lot of debate about people’s methodologies from external sources on market share and so I would just – even the press itself kind of cautioned all these numbers off late, so I would just kind of put the flag out again to say just be cautious. I mean we are very pleased with our results right now in terms of market share. And –
Youssef Squali – Jefferies
Do you feel you are losing market share?
Patrick Pichette
And – no. And the issues that we have is if you think of – now I just want to go back to – because there has been so much noise in this data, I think it’s important just to mention it. The – if you go back to the fundamentals of hiring and CapEx, CapEx right is lumpy. And here is a perfect example of lumpiness, right, to be able to work in Scandinavia in the winter is difficult as we said we are building a data center there. Now, it’s spring and we are working there. So, we are also adding machines and it just happens that when you get the generations of chips available and everything is available then you start rolling out. We had a bit of kind of – so the lumpiness shouldn’t surprise anybody. And I think that everybody that I had discussions with when we were at kind of like 189 million or it’s clearly on – also unsustainable at low level. So we are kind of running our plans accordingly. So just stay tuned for CapEx, but is just happened to be lumpy.
In terms of hiring I think that it really is the case that we – I am going to take a step back to three quarters ago when we said look for us the recession is over. For us we see great products and we have a mindset of the next half decade and the big platforms we are building that are creating these huge ecosystems, and for us search is one and then mobile and Android as we just talked is one. And then display is amazing, right. It’s really growing. And to not put resources to actually fuel this ecosystem, which is the next decade, it’s just such an opportunity. So that’s why we are investing aggressively. We think it’s the right thing to do at the moment in the company. So – and that’s the balance we are striving. Even in Q3, right, if you think of headcount, we have a lot of people – I should call them – the people that we just graduate form university that are going to joining us, right. So there may be even be you can think of the bump of the accepted but not started because they are going to go backpacking for the summer before they come and join us. But I mean ultimately, right, we are looking at a trend of continuing to invest. And it’s the right thing at this time in the history of the company. So that’s on CapEx and on hiring.
And then on contextual search, if there is something that you want to – you need a more refinancer for Jonathan – I am not sure I understand—
Jonathan Rosenberg
I guess I am not sure what data you are looking at or what examples you are referring to.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies
Well just I mean there – the two main competitors have adopted some processes that in a way inflates their – the number of searches that are run on their databases and you guys don’t do it. Wanted to just know if this is something that you guys may pursue as well or –
Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure. I understand. Right, so I mean in general we don’t comment on the third-party data but what you are alluding to are basically the methodological problems that have been publicizes with respect to autoroll slide shows that generate. Basically if you think about it from a search perspective, it’s a spurious request because it’s not merely an incremental search.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies
All right.
Jonathan Rosenberg
So the thing that matters to us is ultimately consummating transactions via conversions that we are sending to advertisers. So what we care about is the number of genuine searches that users are running where they want to get directly to an answer or a website or where they are interested in actually clicking on an advertiser’s ad. It wouldn’t help us in any respect other than in generating counts in share data to cause our search – to cause the total number of searches to artificially go up if there wasn’t user intent behind them that was a value to our advertisers. So, the basic answer to your question is no.
Youssef Squali – Jefferies
Okay. Thanks so much, thanks.

And if not can you talk about which countries really stand out from a growth perspective on the positive side? Thank you.

Nikesh Arora
I prefer not to talk about regions because in every region there are countries which do fantastically, there are countries which are challenged. If you are asking about Greece, I wouldn’t have to answer the question. So similarly, there are countries like Russia, like Brazil, like India, which are growing fantastically for us and continue to show good growth. It’s a combination of more advertisers; it’s a combination of Internet penetration getting higher. It’s combination of people getting savvier, advertisers getting more and more ready for the (inaudible). So we are seeing good growth this quarter. We saw good growth in Brazil, India, Russia, and we saw great growth. And then we saw good growth from many other parts of the world. So, even places like France performed for us wonderfully this quarter. So, even these are larger markets places like Australia and New Zealand performed well for us.

Sandeep Aggarwal – Caris and Company
Thanks for taking my questions. Actually I have two questions, one is if you look at the sponsored clicks versus CPC last quarter, paid clicks were up 15%, CPC was up 7%. Sponsored – paid clicks remained at the same level, but CPC have come down quite a bit. I know some of this is mix shift. May be some of this is OpEx. But I guess my question is, is there any competitive dynamics or may be increasing focus towards organic search or changing user behavior (inaudible) in terms of some weakness in CPC? And then I have a follow-up.
Jonathan Rosenberg
This is Jonathan. I think probably the easier way to answer the question is to just give you my quick observations on the things which are clearly driving – contributing to driving CPCs on average up versus those that are impacting them in the other direction. I don’t see anything from a user perspective or a share perspective that is obvious that’s impacting the overall equation. I think we are seeing on the positive side conversion rates improving, which is driving CPCs up. I think you r comment about the relative shift in mix to google.com from AFC does contribute positively to CPC. Google.com is obviously higher. So any mix shift there, everything else being constant, increases CPC. The obvious things that we’ve talked about in the past that push it in the other direction or emerging markets, Brazil, India and Nikesh talked about some of those examples earlier. Mobile growing in the mix and people increasingly looking for longer tail queries that monetize lower to add into their campaigns. But those are the overall factors.
Sandeep Aggarwal – Caris and Company

Patrick Pichette
Sorry, Sandy, go along with your follow-up.

And you specifically made comments that DoubleClick was very strong and then based – also you have your Nexus one which is contributing second quarter in terms the – kind of incremental revenue source. In spite of these things, other revenue was noticeably slowed. So, is there [ph] some kind of slowdown in the Google enterprise business or what else is going on there?

On China, look, we are basically at the same place when we last discussed or last time we talked about it, which is we have – the good news is we have our license renewal but – and apart from that from a – certainly from a financial perspective I just want to reiterate to everybody, right, revenue from China is not material to our revenue.

I think the main thing that’s really going to fundamentally have to change there which is the big difference between mobile an d desktop is that today the – on a mobile phone people are actually less likely to consummate a transaction because of the logistics of entering the credit card or being signed in on a browser is somewhat more time-consuming and onerous. So I think that – for the mobile system, to move very aggressively is going to require more of those commercial transactions actually being taken and placed on the mobile devices. The display side, the AdSense for mobile is actually doing very, very well. And one of the reasons that’s doing well is sort of the opposite of what I just stated in terms of effect.
On a mobile device the display ad is something that really kind of gets in your face. The screen is relatively small so you see it. It’s unlike a desktop in that you are not typically doing multiple things at once. So display I think is relatively closer to the desktop than is search based ads.

And we’ll go next to Sameet Sinha from JMP Securities.
Sameet Sinha – JMP Securities
Yes, thank you very much. I just wanted to – if you could comment on this Omnicom deal that you had signed? Can you talk about what the ramifications are, what sort of advertisers do you expect will participate, and any other details would be appreciated?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, sure. You have to understand, as we look at display, there are two significant changes that are happening right. One is display buying which traditionally has been advertising – advertisers buying sites is slowly and surely shifting to audience buying. So, I as an advertiser no longer want to buy Tiffany.com or newyorktimes.com. I want to be able to say I would like 18 to 35 year olds who are savvy, who understand technology and who will be interested in my product.
Now as you go towards that audience buying notion, what advertisers are looking for is they’re looking for specific inventory on specific audiences whichever site they might be on. So it becomes even more important for some sort of trading desk type phenomena to exist where an advertiser can buy across any publisher they’d like to buy.
Now that makes it even more important that you can find some trading desk or trading exchange where you can have every publisher represented. Because if you have seven different networks, it’s suboptimal as an industry to have an advertiser have to go to seven different networks to be able accumulate what he insists, the different standards, the different way to seven different networks to look like. So if that can leave the ad agencies which are buying advertising – the advertisers would like to have a common platform which allows them to buy across these entire networks. And that’s what we’re working Omnicom with where they believe that if they have the right trading environment setup for their advertisers, it’s going to be tremendous value for the advertisers because advertisers come to a one-stop shop and buy across networks and also allows a tremendous efficiency because the best seller of advertiser may not be the best acquirer or a publisher. So therefore, you can separate that in some sort of an ad exchange context, which is what Omnicom is working with us on. And if you get it right, there is hundreds of millions of dollars that’s taking this kind of a deal because that allows very effective buying across-the-board on a network and every player in that ecosystem can get their fair share of the profit.
Sameet Sinha
Okay. Thank you.

And we’ll go next to Mayuresh Masurekar from Kaufman Brothers.
Mayuresh Masurekar – Kaufman Brothers
Hi. Could you talk a little bit about search remarketing? It seems that you are by far the leader in search, so a lot of the spare advertisers would need Google for doing this well. So what kind of growth or traction have you seen for search remarketing? And what’s the pricing for this product compared to other display alternatives? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
We don’t do search remarketing. We do remarketing in the display side. We basically are able to go, look at what we call interest-based advertising. If you understand the certain uses or interested in certain things, we have based on their – they’re having children to allow us to use that information. We have the ability then market to them and show them ads. And that is way more effective and blindly trying to show advertising to users of clearly we’re seeing tremendous success and adhere but that’s all we do in terms of remarketing.
Mayuresh Masurekar – Kaufman Brothers
And what’s the pricing for this compared to other alternatives?
Patrick Pichette
The pricing – look it’s very simple. The more effective the advertising is, the more likely the advertisers are willing to bid more money for it. So you should expect the more efficient we make advertising, the more relevant it become, the more ROI it generates to the advertiser. They will need to compete more aggressively with other advertisers with the same piece of real estate. So we see that. We see the effectiveness of that reflected in higher CTC for that particular product.
Mayuresh Masurekar – Kaufman Brothers

And we’ll go next to Colin Gillis from BGC Financial.
Colin Gillis – BGC Financial
Hey Patrick, how many acquisitions this year? What is the philosophy on the financial discipline used to determine the purchase price, and then separately, with ITA competitiveness?
Patrick Pichette
I’m not going to comment on the last piece. What I’m going to say is, that we have – there’s a real kind of triangulation between two factors in our strategy for acquisitions. So think of it as talent, intellectual property and then price. And so but what we’re looking for is a sweet spot where when we find teams of people that are have clear leadership that if you think about it, the venture capital world is actually kind of voted by them surviving as long as they have and they have as a team great talent – engineering talent specifically. Then on top of that, put the second piece of it which is, they have proven that they actually have good intellectual property whether it be – whatever be up there, they’re working on or whatever in the case is you just mentioned of ITA right, a lot of interesting kind of structural data.
So the third piece is obviously price. There is a price after which, is a price – there is a trade-off of on price and what we do is, we do every one of them. We ask ourselves the question, we look at the intellectual – and then you put the overarching last fit which is how does that fit within those four areas that I’ve talked earlier of which is what we’re trying to accelerate our development. So, AdMob is a perfect example of that where great technology, fantastic team at the right price and basically take a huge junk of what was our engineering roadmap and bring it today, integrate it into the team and then we have much smaller team some times of 12 to 15 individual great piece that actually on to and there is another one like that, right, when you think about the video Kotak. So it’s always the – and there are many cases where we look at them and we don’t buy them because we can find us at somewhere in those three. So I mean that’s how we think about it and it is disciplined. And we have the base about them and sometimes we kind of – we often say no. That’s how we think about it. So there are efforts (inaudible) you walk away from just because of the purchase price at the end of the day. Oh, yes we do.
Colin Gillis – BGC Financial
I think sort of (inaudible). You just talk a little bit about or help this frame how additive are mobile search is? Is there a rate of search growth you could share for users across all devices may be tied to the same login?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I don’t actually have any data but intuitively, I think that they are additive because – I mean, think about it this way, when you’re at your desktop, if you have your PC at your desktop and you mobile phone, you’re not going to do the search on your mobile phone, so almost all searches that you were otherwise doing on your desktop, I think you’re still going to do on your desktop. On the other hand, there are times when you are out with your mobile phone, and you didn’t have your desktop device, and obviously those are, by definition incremental unless of course in theory you’d remember to go back and do that search when you came back to your desktop. But I don’t think that there is much evidence that that’s the case. I think the vast majority of them are incremental. I think they’re also slightly different usage patterns across desktop and mobile. You tend to see more use of the mobile devices on weekends, which is not surprising but they don’t actually have any more specific data that proves those observations or that hypothesis.
Patrick Pichette
You might imagine those curves, including the transaction curves, ultimately bend towards each other over time.
Colin Gillis – BGC Financial
I guess I don’t understand exactly what you’re saying.
Patrick Pichette
Our usage – our mobile usage in the way we use our mobile efficient as we get more broader band. You’ve talked about your 4G connections.
Colin Gillis – BGC Financial
Sure.
Patrick Pichette
And our desktop usage, I mean ultimately, there should be much difference between the two of them over time.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Well I think the mobile usage is, the mobile usage will grow and in many ways will be incremented because you’ll be able to do a lot more when you’re out in the field and for example being able to – in within a store, scan a barcode with your smartphone, look at the price on the shelf and determine whether or not you actually would prefer to consummate the transaction through a web-based alternative and then automatically complete the transaction. It’s a kind of thing that’s all going to be incremental and I think as these devices are able to do more of that, the people are going to do it.
Colin Gillis – BGC Financial
Yes. Right it makes sense. Thank you.
Jane Penner
Next question please.

And we’ll go next to Heath Terry from FBR Capital Markets.
Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets
Great thanks. And Patrick, in looking at YouTube beyond views, it’s obvious that the majority of those views still aren’t being monetized and in a way. So what’s standing on the way of more monetization of this inventory, which, for the most part, still seems to be the user-generated content side of thing? How significant as it and does the Viacom ruling, it change your ability to monetize that inventory?
Patrick Pichette
I’m going to let Nikesh to give you the kind of high level answer and then I’ll circle back on the Viacom specific.
Nikesh Arora
Okay. I don’t know, let Patrick about the Viacom but you have to understand first of all, YouTube is five years old, right. So this is a phenomenon that has been created over the last five years. We look at YouTube and we monetize it many different ways. We monetize the homepage of YouTube. We monetize more watch pages on the YouTube. We do promote your videos and looking at best new ways and looking at how we can put ads into content. Now part of the process that has been going on, is we have to continue to free up more and more inventory for it to be available for us to advertise on. So we’ve done a lot of deals recently where whether with music society around the world on the various countries around the world, but we are getting permissions to be able to show advertising in those places, which allow us to create more inventories. That’s so – that’s the inventory side of things.
And we believe we’re in a good path to continue to create more and more available inventory. In addition to the inventory side, we have to now keep getting advertisers to start getting giving us quality video advertising, which can be put into YouTube. And my view on this is that, we’re in the very, very early stages of video advertising because what advertisers do, they will splice the video ad that they’ve created for television and they’ll also take it on YouTube. Now if you understand, YouTube allows you two more things which the television does not. It allows you to interact with the ad, which TV does not and most of the ads on – video ads so far are not interactive. So we expect as that begins to happen, people will start creating more and more interactive. Secondly it allows you to – it allows you to create some degree of personalization. The ad your grandmother sees and I see and my daughter see did not necessarily be the same ad for anything. So both those features we think will come into play in more and more in the advertising side. So as you get more personalization, more interactivity, as we get more inventory clarified for YouTube, we think that it’s going to create more and more decisional opportunities and you couple that with the previous conversation on display and the ability by audiences that would just provide sort of the (inaudible) indicate, as this thing goes forward.
Patrick Pichette
Terry, on my side, look on – on the issue of our icon right. We’re still in the PL side. I don’t want to comment on the specifics. What I can say is two things, right. Obviously, with more clarity from this judgment, it gives us more room for experimentation that we didn’t have before because until these rules are clear, you don’t know exactly where the bar is. And with that clear bar, we now have much more room for experimentation. And then on just to comment on, if there was ever a great illustration of Nikesh’s point a minute ago. I mean, just looking the last few weeks about the Old Spice experiment on YouTube and if you have not tried that, just go on YouTube and check Old Spice about the interactivity of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and advertise it’s just absolutely phenomenal. So it just gives you a glimpse of where the world is going and it tells you again about we’re just scratching the surface.
Heath Terry – FBR Capital Markets
Great. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. We’ll go to the next question.
Jane Penner
Yes, operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator
And we’ll take our final question from Richard Fetyko from Merriman & Company.
Richard Fetyko – Merriman & Company
Now thanks guys. If you breakdown the components of your display strategy in revenue streams, how would you rank the revenue opportunity of each between YouTube, AdSense, Display Network and the Ad Exchange in the long-term?
Patrick Pichette
I’ll let Nikesh to answer it.
Nikesh Arora
I think it’s very important to understand that all these things were to complement each other. The Ad Exchange allows a buyer to buy across multiple networks. So without an Ad Exchange, it makes a very inefficient for advertising we’ve bought and therefore the buyer is not going to go as fast enough. So you want to make sure you can create some consistency in standardization in the way display advertising has been bought. If you want to take the big TV dollars to start coming into display as they had in the early years. I think with Google Display Network it’s our ability to prove that we can create a network of our own of multiple publishers and create premium capability for our advertisers to be able to target those publishers.
And last but not the least YouTube becomes our owned and operated property, something like us operating google.com and our Google network. So clearly the margins on our owned and operated properties are higher and that allows us to have a premium property in this space and also allows us to accumulate tremendous amounts of content which we can then that I’ll just advertising and so at present all these three are very relevant to the overall strategy, I’m not trying to prioritize anyone over the other, particularly YouTube being able to monetize bringing more TV dollars into YouTube is fantastic. Google Display Network being able to monetize at opportunity across multiple publishers is great and without Ad Exchange which if we do that’ll bind all these networks together, it is hard to see that industry growing as fast as we’d like to see it grow.
Patrick Pichette
Let me give – if you allow, I mean the CFO answer. These are each and every one of them billions of dollars of revenue opportunities. They’re not hundreds of millions, they’re – the way we think about it in terms of addressable market, this is already a $20 billion industry that is growing really fast and so for us every one of them we talk. And that’s why again, we continue to invest in the total echo system.
Listen we’ve had – so thank you very much for all of your questions. I want to thank Nikesh and Jonathan again for joining me. I wish to thank every Googler that’s on the call listening to us, I mean, our engineers, our sales force, our support staff, all these people, I mean every 90 days we look at our results and we continue to be so pleased. But it is really the great part of work all are Googlers.
And so for that perspective, I’d just want to give two thumbs up again to the Googlers for a fantastic job over Q2 and with that in mind, I’ll turn it back over to Connie and I wish you a great summer everyone and we’ll talk to you in Q3. Connie, you can close the call please?

Welcome to the Google Inc. conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Maria Shim, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma’am. 
Maria Shim
Good afternoon everyone and welcome to today’s first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Huber, Senior Vice President of Engineering; Susan Wojcicki, Vice President of Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of Product Management; and Nikesh Arora, President Global Sales Operations and Business Development. 
Also, as you know we are now distributing our earnings release exclusively through our newly revamped Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So going forward please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as supplementary slide decks that accompany the calls. This call today is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our website in a few hours. 
Now let me now quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding investments in our innovation agenda, expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. 
Please refer to our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, as well as our earnings press release for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting investor.google.com. 
In addition, certain financial measures we use on this call, such as operating profit and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.
With that I will now turn the call over to Patrick. 
Patrick Pichette 

Thank you Maria. Good afternoon. This is Patrick Pichette speaking. Thank you for joining us. Starting the New Year provides us with a great opportunity to tune and streamline our quarterly earnings communications. As a result, we have today for you a new format for the call. First, the two calls we had last year will be merged into a single call going forward and slightly longer for the Q&A. 
Second, Eric will not be joining us going forward so I will be leading the call. In the new format Jonathan Rosenberg and I will review the quarter with prepared remarks and then Nikesh Arora, our head of Global Sales and Operations will be joining us for Q&A. Unfortunately today Jonathan couldn’t be with us. However, we have with us Jeff Huber, our Senior Vice President of Engineering for Ads and Susan Wojcicki, our Vice President for Advertising Products sitting in for Jonathan. 
So here we go. Let me start by giving you some high level thoughts about our situation in Google before I go into the details of our Q1 performance. As we enter 2010 it is really clear the digital economy continues to grow rapidly and at Google our users and advertisers all continue to benefit from this profound and positive trend. 
Our Q1 results are simply a reflection of these trends and this really fuels our optimism as we continue to invest in innovation for the long run. Consequently, we are continuing to invest heavily in people, products and acquisitions. So you see this already in our results for Q1. On people we have already stepped up hiring which is evident obviously with the numbers presented and we expect to continue hiring aggressively through the year. We have a strong pipeline of candidates primarily focused on engineering and ad sales and we are on-boarding them to fuel our growth agenda as fast as possible. 
On product we continue really to push the envelope on two fronts. First, we are intensely focused on user experience. Our continued success really depends on delighting users with differentiated products that really inspire. Think of Google Goggles for example. Second, we are continuing to improve our ad business to show the right ad in the right format to the right person at the right time, all of this regardless of device. Susan and Jeff will really cover in the coming minutes both of these sections. 
Finally, acquisitions. We have been very active so far this year and we have a strong M&A pipeline in place. It is really designed to build on our existing focus areas and to bring new talent and new technology to Google, feeding our entrepreneurial spirit. It really matters to us. So in sum, we continue to be incredibly excited by the opportunities in front of us and in consequence we should expect to see continued investment in each of these areas. 
On the business front, Q1 was really a strong quarter. The healthy momentum from Q4 and the general economic recovery has simply continued, resulting in a very positive start to the New Year for us. Large advertisers have come back in force versus last year, reflecting really an improved economy and a few really key important trends. For example, it is clear now our offerings are much broader in scope. By this I mean they offer highly measurable but also integrated campaigns across search, display and mobile. As a result, our conversations with advertisers are becoming more and more strategic because of this integration. You can see this in our results and our performance. 
By this I mean we perform well across every major product area including search, display, mobile and enterprise in Q1, running on all cylinders. 
Search. Google.com was very strong. Great performance across all geographies and all major verticals including retail, travel, local, technology and finance. Growth in display was also really strong. Q4 momentum continued across all regions, products and channels. The Google Content Network was strong driven by increased demand in consumer packaged goods and entertainment. The Ad Exchange is also gaining great traction as we move all buyers and sellers into the latest version of the platform. Finally, we saw very impressive growth on You Tube with several exciting new content deals signed. 
Mobile. Third axis. Another great, very important area for Google is also growing very nicely benefiting from both continued growth in Smart Phone volumes and internet usage on the i-hand mobile devices. Finally, enterprise recently launched a host of successful integrations including a large deployment at, for example, KLM, just one example among many. All this great performance is reflected in our financial results and our trajectory. 
So I will now, if you will let me, go through our results quickly. Financially, gross revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $6.8 billion. Google Websites revenue grew up 20% year-over-year to $4.4 billion with strength, as I mentioned, across all major geographies and verticals. Our AdSense revenue was up 24% year-over-year to $2 billion reflecting again the continued strength in the Google Content Network, an important part of our display business. Other revenue was also up 68% year-over-year to $300 million and that includes the revenue from the sales of our Nexus One product. 
Global aggregate paid click growth remained healthy up 15% year-over-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate cost per click growth was up 7% year-over-year but down 4% quarter-over-quarter. You should note that FX had a positive impact on the year-over-year on CPC growth and also a negative impact quarter-over-quarter. A lot of movement in FX year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Remember too this is an aggregate number which includes both Google.com and also the AdSense properties. 
Turning to our geographic performance revenue from the U.S. was up 22% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. In our earnings slides, which you will find on our investor relations website, you will see we have broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs so please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. 
International revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue or $3.6 billion, up 24% year-over-year which includes $10 million of benefits from our hedging programs. This is a big difference compared to $154 million of benefits in Q1 of last year. Using fixed exchange rates our international revenue would have been roughly $242 million lower year-over-year. Finally, the U.K. was up 15% year-over-year to $842 million. So very strong performance right across the board on the revenue. 
Let me turn to expenses for a moment. Traffic acquisition costs were $1.7 billion or 26% of total advertising revenue. The other cost of revenue was $741 million including stock based compensation of $6 million which also expenses related to the sale of Nexus One. Finally, all operating expenses totaled $1.8 billion including approximately $285 million of stock based compensation. The increase year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to increases in payroll and advertising and promotion expense. 
The results of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit which does exclude stock based compensation increased to $2.8 billion in Q1 resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 41%, up approximately 180 basis points year-over-year. Headcount was up 800 approximately versus Q4 of last year, ending the quarter with approximately 20,600 full-time employees. Finally, our effective tax rate was 22% for Q1. 
For a minute let me turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $18 million for Q1 which includes great progress in our portfolio management performance but also largely offset by the timing and accounting impact of hedging expenses associated with the FASB 133. For more detail on OI&E again please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. 
All of this turns out to operating cash flow which was very strong at $2.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $239 million again primarily related to our data center operations. As a reminder, CapEx is lumpy from quarter-to-quarter depending on when we are able to make these investments. Free cash flow finished the quarter with a strong $2.3 billion. 
In summary we are very pleased with the performance in Q1 across revenue, margins and cash flow. As a result we are very optimistic and therefore are pushing ahead with significant investments as I outlined to you a few moments ago. Finally, let me remind you as I do every year at this time that our revenue typically exhibits some seasonality between Q1, Q2 and Q3 because of the coming summer months. 
With that and before we open it up to questions we will have Susan and Jeff cover their comments and then we will come back to Q&A. Thank you. I will turn it to Susan. 
Susan Wojcicki 

Thanks Patrick. I would like to take this opportunity today to talk about some of the big areas of investment in our advertising business; search, display and mobile and how they are going so far. We see a lot of opportunity to innovate in these categories and to make the ads better and more useful. 
As we expand into new kinds of inventory beyond search our goal is to enable high performance, cross-media campaigns from within AdWords. Let me start with search. Starting about a year ago we asked ourselves why do search ads just have to be text links. In organic search the right result might be a video, a book or an update from a social network. We call this universal search. But ads are also information. They are commercial information and in many cases it may be more useful to the users and the advertiser if we show a video or picture or product in the ad. 
For example, if you search on the query “HP All in One Printer” some of the ads now include pictures of HP printers, prices and where you can buy them. Or if you are looking for a movie and you search “The Losers” the ad may give you the option to watch the movie trailer right within the ads. Other ads which we call site links enable advertisers to drive traffic to specific parts of their site. The query “Toys R Us” is a good example of this with links to products the retailer is promoting such as Nerf toy specials or pre-ordering Barbie. 
The idea is to make the ads more useful and therefore higher performing. So far they are doing very well. Click through rates on site links, for example, are up as much as 30-40%. We also want to give advertisers more data and insight into their campaigns and customers. Users usually go through a progression of searches and can interact with a number of ads before actually buying the product. 
For example, a user may search and click on ads for a digital camera and then on Canon before actually clicking on an ad for the Powershot S90 and buying the camera. To help use advertisers optimize for this behavior we launched a new reporting feature this quarter called the search funnel which tells advertisers about those earlier searches and the ads the users interacted with earlier in the buying process. By thinking about the right portfolio of key words, advertisers can maximize their conversions. 
Moving onto our display business we have seen very strong momentum. We are investing heavily in three different areas. Our platform which includes the DoubleClick suite of products, our AdExchange and our Content Network and You Tube. We are bringing the performance, efficiency and measurability to the display world like we did with search which we believe can overall grow the display market and benefit everyone. 
On the platform side this quarter launched the largest Google and DoubleClick integration to date, a new version of DoubleClick for publishers which has been re-written on Google technologies. The new version gives publishers more data and better tools to manage and maximize their return directly and indirectly sold ad space. 
We are also doubling down on our new AdExchange, the second pillar in our display strategy. It is ramping nicely and publishers and advertisers are getting great results. Some publishers are increasing their yield by as much as 130% when compared to ads sold directly to ad networks. One of the key features we are very excited about on the new exchange is real-time bidding which enables advertisers to bid on an impression by impression basis using their own data. By bringing this level of efficiency to display advertising buying everyone wins. 
Third, on the Content Network we have introduced a number of new features in the past year. It is a long list. Interest based advertising, frequency capping, above the fold targeting, new measurement tools and many new formats among other features. Combined they create a compelling platform for display advertisers to reach users globally. This quarter we added a new feature I would like to talk about called remarketing. 
Remarketing enables advertisers to show ads to users who have visited the website or the You Tube channel. So if you are shopping around for a vacation destination or go to one resort site and then leave when you visit another site in our network that resort could show you an ad with a discount coupon. As a user this means I can get a much more compelling ad. As an advertiser it is an opportunity to connect with interested users. 
Mobile is also doing very well. This will be an increasingly important form of advertising as user’s transition to Smart Phones with full browsers. We want to make it easy for advertisers to extend their existing campaigns to mobile rather than having to start from scratch. When advertisers run on desktop and mobile we enable them to separate their campaign staff by desktop or mobile to understand their mobile performance. Many of them are surprised by how much mobile activity they have received. Based on this information they can decide how to customize their mobile campaigns going forward. 
We also rolled out new formats and targeting options specific for mobile. This quarter we launched a Click to Call feature that automatically puts the phone number in the ad that is running on a Smart Phone. So if you are looking for auto insurance and do that query from your Android or iPhone the ads will include a number to call. Not surprisingly this has increased click through, or should I say call through. I am just scratching the surface of all of the innovations our ad team is working on but I have to hand it over to Jeff now. Thank you. 
Jeff Huber 

Thanks Susan. Across all of our products we push to push ourselves to continually innovate. We believe in open platforms that encourage everyone else to push innovation too. 
Our efforts in mobile are a great example of this at work. Eric Schmidt mentioned at a speech at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona in February that we are taking a mobile first approach to most everything we do. That means doing things that take advantage of the unique characteristics of mobile Smart Phones. 
One of those is your Smart Phone knows where you are; your location. So this quarter we launched a feature called Near Me Now that essentially turns your location into the search query. If you go to Google.com from a Smart Phone you will see the “near me now” link right under the search box. Click on it and you will see restaurants, cafés, shops, gas stations, ATMs and other things of interest that are closest to you. 
Another common use case is when you are searching for something at home and then want to find it again when you are out and about. Our new Stars and Search feature helps out there. You do a search say for a chili recipe and when you click on a great result you click on the star next to it. Later when you are at the grocery store to pick up the ingredients you just repeat the search with your Smart Phone which is easy to do with the “suggest” feature. Just type the first character or two, the query will pop up or with voice search which is increasingly ubiquitous across the platforms and that star result shows right up at the top. 
The same starred results now work on maps too. Do a search at home or work for an address or a restaurant, click a star next to the right result and that star shows up in your map on the Smart Phone making it easy to get directions or get more information about it. These are small features in some ways but a big innovation in how Smart Phones can integrate into your everyday life. 
Our open platforms, Android and Chrome, are gaining a lot of momentum. Android is now powering 34 devices which is up 70% quarter-over-quarter from 12 different OEMs and over 60,000 Android devices are sold and activated every day. Our whole mantra with Android is “open.” First the Android OS itself is open for partners to modify and extend on their own. Then the Android market for apps is open for apps is open for all developers which is driving a lot of growth and great apps. We are now at over 38,000 apps, up 70% quarter-over-quarter. The net effect is to make web-ready Smart Phones more widely available. It is helping drive a lot of mobile search and apps usage.  
Chrome is also growing really well, mostly driven by its technical innovations and performance and its security relative to other browsers. The new Chrome feature we launched just a few weeks ago helps address language as barrier to web use around the world. Chrome can now automatically translate any page you are viewing into any one of 52 different languages. If you are an English speaker and want to read the local news in Paris you can go to Lemonde.fr and Chrome will offer to translate the page for you. 
Uptake has been great. We are already translating over 60 million pages per day. If we can help knock down the language barrier through innovative features like this the web becomes a lot more accessible and useful for everyone around the world. 
Our latest open ecosystem effort is the apps marketplace for Google Apps. Many of our enterprise customers want to move more of their operations to the cloud including applications that Google doesn’t offer like CRM, accounting, project management, workflow automation, HR, the list goes on. The apps marketplace has had thousands of enterprise apps purchased and installed already all integrated with the Google Apps experience. 
Finally, we are looking forward to our Google IO developer conference coming up in May. IO sold out in just a few days as developers know that in the event’s short history we have used it to announce some pretty amazing things in addition to covering the huge amount of content on how they can innovate with and leverage Google’s open platforms. When you open up the web and unleash the passion and innovation of thousands and thousands of developers great things happen. 
Thanks for your time. Back to Patrick.  
Patrick Pichette 

Thank you Jeff.  Thank you Susan. What we will do now is I will invite Nikesh also to join us and ask Maria to open up the call for questions and then Maria will direct the questions for us. Maria?

Operator, can we start taking questions please? 
Question and Answer Session

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs. 
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
In your cash flow statement you have a repurchase of stock minus $97 million and I thought Google wouldn’t buy back stock until the [Ad More] acquisition was complete. Second question, with regard to domestic and international revenue it is great that your domestic revenue is growing almost as fast now as your international revenue but it is also a little bit surprising to me. Is that primarily because you have more new activity like Nexus One contributing domestically than internationally or does that reflect a more V-shaped recovery than internationally? 
Patrick Pichette 

I will take the first question and then I will let Nikesh answer the second one. On the first one, it is because when we bought On Tube what we wanted to do was it was a share transaction, you will remember, and because it was a share transaction we decided to actually re-buyback the shares thereafter to make it a cash transaction. It is that simple for that transaction. For the international, Nikesh? 
Nikesh Arora 
I think it is a combination of the things you suggest and a bit more. We are seeing a better recovery in the domestic market, definitely if you look at the comps from last year the numbers look much better. We are seeing tremendous activity from our large advert5risers who are coming back in droves and are actually reconfirming their faith in search advertising. So that is all working. Plus many of our product innovations start in the U.S. which allows us to drive those revenues faster in the U.S. 
Having said that, internationally our revenues did not take as material a dip as relative to the U.S. so clearly the comps are much stronger on the international side. It is a basked of many, many, many countries so we are seeing recovery in some of the major markets. Other markets are still not on that curve of recovery as we are seeing in some of the more mature, larger markets in Europe.

The next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney – Citigroup. 
Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
What percentage of your revenue now would come from mobile display and enterprise on a gross basis? Secondly, is Nexus One as a group profitable? Third, could you give us a little color on the CPC rate? Due to the dramatic fall off in conversion rates due to the economy in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 it is reasonable to expect perhaps CPCs would have risen more. Is there something else we should think about as kind of tempering the growth in CPCs now? 
Patrick Pichette 

Remind me of your first question. 
Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
What percentage of your revenue comes from mobile display and enterprise combined? 
Patrick Pichette 

Unfortunately we can’t give you that. We don’t divulge that kind of information. On the Nexus One it is a profitable business for us. We don’t give more detail on the economics but we are driving the business to be a profitable business from the get go. On CPC maybe Susan can give us more comments as to what is going on there. 
Susan Wojcicki 

I will give a couple of comments about the CPCs. I think there are a number of trends that we see. I think it is important to remember first of all that the CPC and the numbers we release are an aggregate number and so there are a couple of things happening. One of them has to do with the growth rates of the different regions and CPCs being different in the different regions. 
The second thing which I believe is a long-term positive for Google but may be reflected in the CPC numbers here is we are releasing a lot of tools to enable advertisers to try to find more what I will call long-tail key words. So key words that they might not have been bidding on before hand and they might not be the competitive ones so as a result the CPCs may vary. We believe long-term that is good because we are actually selling more key words and the auctions are becoming more competitive but it may change the mix.

The next question comes from the line of Benjamin Schachter - Broadpoint Am Tech.
Benjamin Schachter - Broadpoint Am Tech
Did you expect to continue to be the default search provider on Apple products going forward? Then if I look at the quarter correctly it looks like you hired about 800 people. Is there anything unique about that number? Is that roughly the rate you think you will be hiring on a go-forward basis? Finally, if there are any other particular comments you can make around Eric not being on the call? Anything else we could read into that? 
Patrick Pichette 

Why don’t we take them in reverse order. Eric is everywhere. Eric is in every public…I have seen him in Abu Dhabi and then fly across to D.C. the next day. He is everywhere. The fact we have decided to streamline our process just for earnings doesn’t mean Eric is not available and he is clearly leading as spokesperson of the company. So very transparent and everywhere. On that point it was just simply an issue of streamlining and making more focus on the financial results for this call. You shouldn’t read any more or less into that decision. 
On the 800 people we have talked about ever since last summer that we are trying to ramp up our machine to hire back specifically in engineering, specifically in the support of sales where we see great opportunities and it takes a couple of quarters to ramp up the machine so we get the levels we want. We are very pleased with the hiring we have done. The bar at Google, let me reemphasize that, has not changed. It is incredibly high. We are very pleased with the on-boarding we have seen this quarter and now that this infrastructure is in place you can expect us to continue to invest heavily in this form. We have so many projects we would love to have more engineers right now that we would like to fuel our growth but it is really paramount for us to continue to focus on it. 
On the Apple, maybe Jeff can comment. 
Jeff Huber 

We can’t speculate on the specific relationship around search. We have historically had a strong relationship with Apple across a number of different areas and we hope to and look forward to continuing that in the future.

The next question comes from the line of Imran Khan – JP Morgan. 
Imran Khan – JP Morgan 
Question about paid clicks growth rate. Considering mobile is growing significantly faster and some of the international countries growing significant faster, paid click growth rate 15% is it fair to assume the domestic paid click growth rate has [decelerated] significantly? Can you give us some color on how should we think about the domestic paid click growth rate? The second question is more of a long-term threat to Google. If you look at third party data it seems like Facebook and other social networking sites while still very low are becoming a bigger part. They are growing significantly faster as a [profit] source to a lot of your big customers like Ebay. How do you think Facebook and other social networking sites are a big long-term threat to Google’s business model? 
Patrick Pichette 

Why don’t I let Jeff talk about the issue of Facebook and then Susan can cover the CPC growth rate. Susan do you want to start or Jeff? 
Jeff Huber 

With regard to other folks out there I guess our net view is we don’t see things as a zero sum game whatsoever. Looking at the internet and vibrancy and rate of growth across the internet, other people are growing and we are very happy with our growth. We don’t see that as a significant issue. 
Susan Wojcicki 

I will comment on the paid click growth. Overall I think we have been very happy with the number and growth we have seen. It is a result of a number of things, certainly the advertisers coming back, some of the largest advertisers spending more money on Google as well as the growth across the board in all regions but was also some of the new ad formats that I spoke about have brought more clicks as to advertisers because they are coming up with formats that are more compelling for users and offering information that is very useful for the users on board and that is causing a lot of growth in paid clicks. 

Patrick Pichette 

In closing on that one, the bottom line is we see it everywhere. It is not one versus another. That is true for both of the questions you asked. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Justin Post – BAS-ML. 
Justin Post – BAS-ML
Last year you were able to give us some intra quarter guidance about how the quarter started and ended. Do you feel better about a trajectory of year-over-year growth exiting the quarter than you did entering the quarter? Secondly on marketing spend I think it is up 48% year-over-year excluding stock based comp. I always thought about you as more of a technology driven company. Why so much marketing spend? Can you talk about your ROI thinking about it or what is it really going to get for Google? 
Patrick Pichette 

On the latter one, the marketing spend, it is clear that we have opportunities and I will give you a couple of examples. One is there is a ballot in Europe right now for Chrome or there are markets in which there is a lot of appetite for on-boarding customers and so we get great ROIs. Nikesh maybe you have additional comments? 
Nikesh Arora 

I think it is important to understand our marketing spend for the most part is ROI based. We spend marketing dollars to go and acquire advertisers on our B2B side. We spend marketing dollars to promote various products. It is very clear for us to understand for each dollar we spend what return we get in terms of long-term value to reach a customer that [inaudible] which creates additional monetization across our properties. You can expect us to spend marketing dollars as and when we see relevant for our long-term strategy and have lots more users for our products. 
Patrick Pichette 

In closing on that one if you think of G&A in general at Google you will find that our G&A is actually like 20-some% as a percentage of revenue. It is not moving that much. What you see is a shift between regular G&A is actually going down which is good news. And you are seeing if we have an incremental dollar and a good ROI base we should take the opportunity on that. As it relates to your first question, we don’t give comments. We had such a crisis in the last 18 months that back then it may have made sense to give some color around quarters but clearly Q4 to Q1 we just look at the level of economic activity and it has continued to pick up which is a great benefit to Google.

The next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital. 
Doug Anmuth – Barclays Capital 
On the Nexus One and in particular can you comment on how many phones you sold during the quarter and if possible you could change the distribution plan going forward so they actually are in stores rather than just online? Secondly, can you comment on China as well and perhaps give us an update there on what you are seeing and any thoughts you might have on what percent of the revenue you might be able to hold onto in that market going forward? 
Patrick Pichette 

I will let Jeff answer the Nexus and then I will cover China. 
Jeff Huber 

We are not disclosing the specific number of Nexus One devices sold. We are very happy with the device uptake and the kind of impact that has had across the industry of raising the bar and people’s expectations of what a great Smart Phone can do. I did earlier mention that across the Android landscape we are seeing more than 60,000 devices sold and activations daily. On stores, sorry we can’t comment anything about that right now. 
Patrick Pichette 

Let me comment on China. We have explained to people that the revenue numbers for China were kind of immaterial to the financial performance of the company in the previous blogs and communications. The bottom line though on China is this was a tough situation where we really believe we have made the right decision. Google stands for really important values like openness, user choice, protection of privacy and in a company that remains true to its values that is what you do. You make a decision that is driven by those values. 
Having said that, what we announced a few weeks ago or a few days ago clearly has us staying in China. We have just changed our strategy and adapted our strategy but our engineering force remains in China and will continue to develop great products. We continue to keep our sales force in place because there is still an export market and a lot of opportunity in China for sales. What we have done is moved back to Hong Kong for Search where we can offer uncensored. From that perspective, right, you should see a lot of positive moves on Google but we made the right call.

The next question comes from the line of Brian Pitz – UBS.
Brian Pitz – UBS 
Can you give us an update on where you are in terms of renewing your distribution deal with News Corp? A quick question on mobile. Is there a plan B if AdMob doesn’t go through? Can you comment on whether you see mobile services eventually being delivered as such through the browser much like the PC rather than individual application downloads? 
Patrick Pichette 

Let me comment on AdMob and then Susan will probably get more commentary on the monetization. The case for AdMob is there is overwhelming evidence the mobile advertising industry both in terms of platforms and providers is nascent. It is incredibly competitive. It didn’t exist 24 months ago. There are dozens of ad networks out there. Even last week you may have heard there was an announcement from Apple that they were starting their own. It is incredibly competitive and that is why we believe we are very positive about making this transaction happen. The case is on our side. 
On the specifics of monetization maybe Susan can give you a bit more color and commentary. 
Susan Wojcicki 

Since you asked about Plan B, I will say Google does have a monetization product for monetizing Google applications AdSense for mobile applications and that is a product we are investing in and we have seen good growth with that one. I just want to reiterate the point Patrick said which is we see this as a very new and nascent market. It is less than 2 years old and there is a lot of competition in this market. We are continuing to work with the FTC on AdMob.
Your other comment was about applications versus web. Google is investing and believes that HTML 5 has the opportunity to enable a lot richer applications on the web. That is something we are investing in and we will see over time how applications and HTML 5 both develop. 
Patrick Pichette 

Let me go back to the very first question you asked which I think the News Corp question was around the MySpace deal. We are working…Google wants every partner in the sense that it is good for the ecosystem it is good for the partners. It gives them opportunities for monetization. We are in negotiations right now of a deal that is to be renewed. These deals like in the case of that specific one, a number of years ago with completely different industry dynamics. We are working with them to find a real win/win and stay tuned for when we have an announcement.

The next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse. 
Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse
On the paid click growth which was up 15% year-over-year that actually reaccelerated for the first time in a couple of years. So I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what is driving that? Is it a combination of Site links, how much of it is mobile, etc.? Secondly, G&A looks like X stock comp it was actually down year-over-year. Is that kind of the rough right absolute level we should be thinking about for the rest of the year? 
Susan Wojcicki 

On paid click I think it is a combination of a lot of different factors and it is really important to remember this is also an aggregate number across all of our businesses. So as we saw advertisers come back and start spending again driven by a lot of our largest advertisers really increasing their spend as well as Google and the ad team bringing a lot of new types of products to market in terms of the Site Link product which has not just one place to click but multiple places to click, we started seeing advertisers have higher click through and so all of those higher click throughs that I talked about do manifest themselves in terms of the aggregate paid click number. Mobile is a component of many different types of inventory that Google is expanding to, to increase the overall paid click number. 
Patrick Pichette 

On the G&A, the short answer is we are going to continue to be disciplined just like you see in the run rate and ramp up you see. We are very disciplined. This place continues to be frugal in many ways. On the other side we are hiring. We are hiring and it is obviously lumpy. So the point is, every time I can find another great engineer to add to the Chrome OS platform I am going to hire them. We are going to hire them. Google needs them. On the flip side there is a lot of discipline around. It is not like you do whatever you want around here. There is discipline.

The next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler – RBC Capital Markets. 
Ross Sandler – RBC Capital Markets 
If you look at year-over-year growth in the U.K. versus ROW on an organic basis they were about the same. Can you talk about what areas in ROW are outperforming and which ones are underperforming? You had mentioned a month or two ago there was some paid click clean up in the fourth quarter. Was there any of that in 1Q and can you talk about the growth rate of O&O clicks versus Google website clicks versus partner site clicks? 
Nikesh Arora 

In terms of U.K. versus rest of the world I think rest of the world for us performed even better than the U.K. did in the last quarter. Having said that as I mentioned there are parts of the rest of the world which are continuing to perform really well for us. Places like Brazil, which we talked about last quarter, places like Russia, etc. continue to perform well. Some parts of the European economy as you are aware which are still undergoing some correction like Greece where you clearly can’t expect us to be performing too well. 
There are pockets of strong performance in rest of the world. They are pretty much in line with our expectations in terms of trends we are seeing which are dependent on broadband penetration and dependent on the e-commerce activity and depending on the small businesses adoption of the internet. As those curves continue to go up we continue to see correspondingly good performance in those markets. We are planning our growth strategies in the markets along those lines. 
Patrick Pichette 

The key word for refinancing for Greece should be pretty [popular]. 
Nikesh Arora 
Unfortunately I don’t think there are 30 billion Euros on the internet for them to get. We would love some advertising business. Now you made me forget your other question. We did do slightly outside of normal cleanup in the last quarter. We are constantly making sure we are taking care of spam and we are taking care of advertising situations where we don’t believe that is appropriate business. We do that on a regular basis. We have done nothing extraordinary this quarter. Last quarter we did look at our policies in certain areas and cleaned it up which is why we mentioned it.

The next question comes from the line of Mary Meeker – Morgan Stanley. 
Mary Meeker – Morgan Stanley 
On the cost per click decline of 4% sequentially by our math if you exclude FOREX the decline was probably closer to 2.5%. I want to rank order the drivers of our sequential decline. Our thinking is that FOREX was the number one driver of the decline. The second was the geographic mix which is an ongoing issue. Third was the tools Susan spoke about to find more long-tail keywords which over time should drive CPC higher or certainly assist CPC. The fourth was the slower economic recovery in Europe versus the U.S. and your comment about Greece related to that. Fifth was another Susan comment, the product innovations roll out in the U.S. first which over time as they roll out in the non-U.S. markets should help CPCs outside of the U.S. One you really didn’t mention was mobile which is probably a factor as well. Is that the right laundry list of drivers of the sequential CPC decline and the right list and the right order in your view? 
Patrick Pichette 

I think that you have in essence the right laundry list. I can tell you the FX, anybody that looks at public information on FX, it is a big contributor to that 4%. For the other last element of the equation is always the mix between Google properties versus the partner properties which also has and especially in the case of international the U.K. So you have all of the elements you talked about plus you have to look at the mix between the [inaudible] properties versus the partner properties. We don’t give you the breakdown of all of the elements as you know but you have the right basket if you include the last one I just gave you. 
Mary Meeker – Morgan Stanley 
A question and I am going to give you a fun name, you have been telling us about lumpiness in CapEx for a really long time. CapEx has been actually very constrained. The phrase is going to be lumpy but disciplined. You have been talking about investments in people for the last couple of quarters. You have increased your headcount about 4% sequentially but your operating spending per employee was flat sequentially. The question we have is as you grow as you should do you think you can continue to keep OpEx per employee flat sequentially? So we will call it lumpy but disciplined? 
Patrick Pichette 

That is the intent. The intent is you onboard Googlers. You take real estate, you take computers, you take computing power but for the model we have right now in the spaces we are it is really about software development and sales. That is the intent. 
On the CapEx side I could argue it could grow 8% quarter-over-quarter but you are absolutely right we are very disciplined about it and we are very proud of in fact getting so much yield out of our infrastructure. Remember, I tell this because it will happen just like we talked about a few quarters ago we were ramping up on hiring, in the same way when there is a great opportunistic purchase on assets we will be there.

The next question comes from the line of Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank. 
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank 
Coming off the bottom obviously from an ad market standpoint can you talk about are you seeing from your marketers at least in the U.S. and customers a different allocation of ad dollars between search and display ads and other initiatives as the product listings and the like as you come up from Q4 to Q1 and beyond? Second question, I guess we continue to believe in your investing in the business. I am curious with the incremental 800 ads is there one or two sets of projects you are allocating incremental investment against whether it be mobile or You Tube or what have you? Just give us a flavor of where you are headed from a product innovation and a traffic growth standpoint. 
Patrick Pichette 

Jeff can talk about all of the areas where we are deploying the engineering. Obviously Nikesh will answer the first quarter. Jeff do you want to give us a sense of where we are plowing resources? 
Jeff Huber 

It is a combination of the core businesses that is strong and growing. We are continuing to invest in that. Susan mentioned in her section a lot of the innovations and new products we have introduced in the core search and display ad business. Some of the other major areas of engineering investment are some of the things I cited; the open platforms Android and Chrome are growing very quickly and having a big impact. We are also investing incrementally in apps in the enterprise business where we are seeing very strong growth and a lot of customer uptake there. 
Nikesh Arora 

Let me answer the headcount question first and then I can go back and talk about the marketers and advertising. As Jeff mentioned on the business side we are continuing to add resources selectively in search as we see the market continuing to grow as well as deploying it in markets where we see higher growth as I mentioned earlier. In addition to that we are putting significant amount of resources in our display space as [inaudible] continues to enhance our display offering and give us more features. That will continue to be a focus for us throughout the year going forward. 
In terms of what we are seeing from [marketers] I think the pull back we have seen about 6-9 months ago is gone. What has also happened in parallel is I continue to see tremendous amounts of capability building the advertiser side. One of the challenges we always have you can go to an advertiser, pitch them with a tremendous search campaign. However, they feel like we lead the horse to water but they still have trouble taking a drink because their websites aren’t fully capable of conducting the e-commerce transactions to the level they would like. 
Having said I have seen tremendous amounts of capability improvement in the last 6-9 months across a majority of our mature markets, the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, etc. which allows us to go in with this bigger, larger campaigns for these guys and they are beginning to understand that search is diminishing inventory because if they don’t buy it today it is not going to be there tomorrow. So they have to be more willing to be flexible with their budgets and be open depending on what is going on. They are getting more and more averse to waive the search. Clearly we are seeing them get more flexible with their dollars in the search side. They are beginning to understand the value of the products like Susan mentioned like remarketing and how to use the display networks effectively and the CPC model and a CPM model depending on which one they choose. 
So clearly the more mature markets we are seeing awareness of the digital marketplace. We are seeing them keep the search [while it’s open] and we are seeing tremendous amounts of engagement on the search side. 
Patrick Pichette 

In closing on that point I think the display market is seeing such an evolution because of the simplicity of the tools that did not exist a year ago are now here and people now have the choice of participating and participating actively. In these campaigns now we would love to have the flexibility from one to another to find the right audience. A tremendous progress we have seen in display and we are very encouraged by what we see. 
Jeetil Patel – Deutsche Bank 
A question to Nikesh’s commentary if companies are having a hard time getting the transaction in the door once they get the traffic and small business has that same issue, I guess would you ever look at a model such as a percentage of sales model to eliminate that issue and have the transaction occur onsite? 
Nikesh Arora 

I want to make sure you interpret what I said carefully. I think we said most of the small businesses are very, very good with their allocation. As we have seen from a few quarters ago we have seen a dip in large advertisement and more small advertising because it is always ROI driven and they generally understand how to bring in a search lead and how to convert that search lead into dollars. I think the challenge with the large advertiser has been that a proportional total ad spend to revenue and not being able to allocate a lot of dollars to their search. Now as they build up their capability they are able to do that more effectively. 
Susan Wojcicki 

One additional thing I would like to add is we definitely see an opportunity to move to taking a percentage of the conversions. In fact we call this CPA, cost per acquisition. One of the products that was developed in this area that we are optimistic about is the product ad product. The way that works is the way the retailer just gives us all of the information about their product; price, listing, description, etc. and then Google actually does the targeting to decide where to show those ads. Then we take a percentage when the product is actually purchased when the user actually converts. We do see that as an opportunity to really simplify the process for advertisers over time and it is something we are investing in.

Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer
Let me ask just a bit about expenses. Did Nexus One have a material impact on sales and marketing expense in the quarter? Two, when we look at seasonal patterns of expenses last year they increased as a percent of revenue in the second quarter. Should we expect a similar pattern this year or is each year different based on your initiatives? 
Patrick Pichette 

To make it simple, on the Nexus One we did not have a material advertising for it. On the second one I wouldn’t provide any guidance for the coming quarters. I would leave it at that.

The next question comes from the line of Youseff Squali – Jefferies & Co.
Youseff Squali – Jefferies & Co.
I want to go back to the China issue and understand a little bit better what you said. Hong Kong a sustainable strategy for you? Doesn’t that put you at a strong disadvantage versus a native player over time? Susan, among the many products you cited; product search, site links, image ads, etc. help us understand which one or one or two are having the most impact on conversion rates and CPCs. 
Patrick Pichette 

On the case of China obviously we still have sales in China and the fact that we serve them in Hong Kong and from Hong Kong doesn’t stop us from having all of the opportunities we want from the Chinese market. Remember that there is a huge industrial infrastructure all around Hong Kong and South China. It is really addressing the market from a different perspective and our sales force is ready to serve them from there. 
Youseff Squali – Jefferies & Co.

Mostly for exporters?
Patrick Pichette 

Both actually. Because we really have both opportunities. What we really have done if you think about it is we have stopped censoring but the access to Google is still available for all Chinese people through .hk.
Susan Wojcicki 

So from an impact standpoint some of the biggest changes that we make that impact the product and all of the metrics, not just CPC and percentage of click growth, etc. a lot of them have to do with changes in ad quality that we make in the quarter. The reason is because if we can make a percentage increase off of that very large business that can have a significant impact. We had a modest quarter in ad quality. We had more than a dozen different launches that were significant across the board and they certainly over time do play an important role in how they affect the metrics. 
The other thing I would like to point out that I think also is really an important thing to look at with our overall business is something we have introduced in AdWords called Opportunity Center. Opportunity Center is a way for advertisers to know this is how many more clicks I should be getting or could be getting. What we want to do is we want to give a lot more guidance to advertisers in terms of here are more key words. They are very easy to add to your key word list. We just launched this quarter Bid Suggestions to give them an understanding of what are the tradeoffs between volume and CPCs and where is the optimal place they should be bidding as well as budget suggestions. 
Because Opportunity Center is applied to the core business and to all of our advertisers it can move the metrics over time in terms of getting more advertisers to buy key words or increase their budgets or change their bids.

The next question comes from the line of Mark May – Needham & Co. 
Mark May – Needham & Co. 
I wonder if you could give some color around the paid click and cost per click growth as it relates to O&O and the network? Did paid clicks grow faster on the O&O network or on the AdSense network? Same for CPCs. The second question is there are a lot of innovative companies in the display space. Earlier you mentioned remarketing but generally speaking there are others out there doing remarketing. So my question is what are the top couple of things that Google is doing that is different in the area of display particularly from a targeting standpoint that is meaningfully differentiated? 
Patrick Pichette 

On the first one I will punt because we don’t divulge the spread between O&O and other properties. I am sure Susan will talk about the display innovations. 
Susan Wojcicki 

So you brought up some questions about remarketing and what we are doing there that is unique. I would definitely agree with you that display is a very vibrant space and there is a lot of innovation that is happening right now in the display market and I think ultimately that innovation will enable the market as a whole to grow. But one of the things that we have that is very unique from a remarketing perspective is users or advertisers can refine users across the content network. The content network because we have so many publishers on our site and because we are a global network as well it gives advertisers the opportunity to expand and find a lot more of those users across the network than they probably can with a lot of other options. 
The other thing we are doing from a targeting perspective is we are trying to make it really easy for advertisers to work with existing interfaces. Right now you can do remarketing within AdWords. So if you are an AdWords advertiser, you can do the remarketing there. If you are a DSA advertiser then you can also from that perspective as well. 
The other thing that is important because you also asked about different types of targeting, we offer a number of different targeting we think are unique. The one we are best known for is the contextual targeting. So the ability to actually figure out on a page what this page is about dynamically and then serve an ad that is matched to that one specifically. Then we also have placement targeting where we give advertisers the ability to choose where they want their ads to appear by actually selecting these are the sites and this is where I want them to appear. The combination of all of these things together give advertisers a large number of options and we are thinking about how do all of these different targeting mechanisms, how do you combine them in a way to provide the best options for the advertisers and users. 
Mark May – Needham & Co. 
When you say content network you do include You Tube in that? 
Susan Wojcicki 

Yes we do include it within there.

The next question comes from the line of Jordan Rohan – Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Jordan Rohan – Thomas Weisel Partners
I have a drill down question on site links and image ads. The question I have is really how do I think about the core basicness of these new ad formats? Over what percentage of queries or what percentage of advertisers do you think it is relevant? It seems like it would be a relatively narrow set of very commercial queries for very response-driven advertisers. How far penetrated are we? How new is this? 
Susan Wojcicki 

You are right that site links is new and we are really just beginning to penetrate all of the advertisers that I think would benefit from the site links feature. We do see Site Links appearing mostly on navigational queries where the users is looking for the brand name or the product category but it is a very powerful tool and we believe there are still a lot of advertisers that are not using it today that would benefit from it. 
The other thing I would say about Site Links is it is rolled out globally and so when you look at the combination of all of the different companies and advertisers globally that could benefit from this we are just getting started because we have just started rolling this out in Q4.

The next question comes from the line of Marianne Wolk – Susquehanna Financial Group. 
Marianne Wolk – Susquehanna Financial Group
With regard to your mobile advertising it sounds like it is an opt-out program now for most AdWords users. If that is true would you also include in-app ads as an opt-out mobile choice as well? Also, is it fair to say based on the comments you made about the content network the mix shifted to the content partners from the search partners by several points this quarter? Did the content network also grow much faster in the U.K. this period than in the U.S.? I know you rolled out the video and display ads on the content network. Can you talk about the uptake there and any positive impact that has had on pricing? 
Patrick Pichette 

Could you repeat your questions so we will all just write them down? 
Marianne Wolk – Susquehanna Financial Group
On the mobile advertising side. It sounds like what you are saying is an opt-out…
Patrick Pichette 

The opt-out issue. The second one was about the U.K. versus other geographies for take up rates for different formats? 
Marianne Wolk – Susquehanna Financial Group
No for the content network and whether you are getting any pricing benefit there from the introduction of display and video ads recently? 
Susan Wojcicki 

On the mobile component I will say we do give advertisers the option. The default is for advertisers to be on search, content and mobile and the reason we do that is because we want to make it as easy as possible for advertisers to get as much reach and reach as many potential users as possible and we try to do the right thing for those advertisers. 
So the default is for them to be opted into both. However, we do offer the ability for advertisers to run a mobile only campaign and under that mobile only campaign we give them the option to target, for example, a specific mobile OS. We give a lot of options within the mobile category. But I really think about that more for advertisers who have the capabilities and are advanced enough to know these are the capabilities they want to do and customize their campaign in order to make it worthwhile for them. 
On the format question I will also say we definitely have been introducing new formats into the display network and we have been really excited about that. In fact we have a product called Display Ad Builder and Display Ad Builder is a template system that enables us to have lots of different ad formats and to add them very, very easily to our network. From an advertiser standpoint they are very, very easy too to actually start and get running is really the click, click, click and your display ad can be running. 
Because the content network and the way we choose which ad is actually run is an auction. If display is winning it is winning  because it is actually a higher CPM ad. So by bringing display ad to the mix with text there is more competition and more variety and so when it makes sense for a display ad to run then it wins the auction and because it won the auction it is bidding more than the existing text ad. Over time that can bring positive competition to the auction.

The next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler – Kaufman Bros. 
Aaron Kessler – Kaufman Bros. 
Can you give us a little more detail on the travel and retail verticals? I know you said all of the verticals are strong. Any more color there? And any updates on your hedging program would be helpful and your thoughts going forward with the hedging. 
Patrick Pichette 

Maybe I can start with the hedges and then turn it to Nikesh. Our hedging program is really effective. I want to remind everybody for us it is an insurance policy. It is an insurance policy for high volatility and specifically if the U.S. dollar strengthens dramatically. If you look at where the Euro was a year ago versus where it was 90 days ago versus where it is now, and then you go back to last year as we discussed we had booked at this time last year big hedging revenues mostly because we had such a massive appreciation of the U.S. dollar so for us very effective in finding the right sweet spot to make sure we have the right coverage. 
What we are caught with is the accounting rules which some quarters like last quarter had very little FAS 133 ruling through the P&L and this quarter has a disproportionate amount. They don’t represent our regular cost of hedging so it creates a bit of fluctuation for you to model but in the end we are very happy with what we are getting out of it. 
In terms of the verticals I will turn it to Nikesh. 
Nikesh Arora 

As you mentioned travel and retail have been strong. I also alluded to the capability building of e-commerce. Primarily I was talking about the retail verticals where we are seeing good strength. Travel is going strong and is steady. Retail and travel end up being one of our larger verticals in the entire landscape. Having said that, I am seeing good strength as well from CPC and entertainment because that is where a lot of the display advertisers like [focus] because those verticals even though they are smaller numbers those verticals aren’t traditionally strong search verticals but they definitely play into the display space and a lot of the display effort has been targeted at those verticals.

The next question comes from the line of Collin Gillis – BGC Partners.
Collin Gillis – BGC Partners 
Was there any tension between Sergei and Eric over China and could that be tied at all to why Eric is not on the call today? 
Patrick Pichette 

No. I am sorry. Thank you for the question. I have a feeling that I have heard every rumor. Thank you for asking the question so candidly. The answer is no. There is nothing going on at all. As we were doing the planning at the end of last year to all the questions, if you doubt that we actually scrub every department at Google I would scrub too and the question was asked is what can you do differently to be better next year? List we brought up in finance was maybe we should look at the quarterly calls and the whole process and the webcasts and one of them was hey we thought this is an innovation. It has nothing to do with that. 
Collin Gillis – BGC Partners 
The newer ad format, does that provide any lift at all to the CPC? Click to play video, along those lines? 
Patrick Pichette 

I think it is one to understand. Some of the newer ad formats [audio fades] CPC based where newer ad formats are sold like traditionally in the display space we sell them as launch pages or home pages. So they are not paid click by click.

The next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley. 
Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley
Just to follow-up on Marianne’s laundry list question, the comment about site revenue and network revenue mix, the site revenue and network revenue were both flat sequentially. I was wondering if you are suggesting that CPCs in the network are actually declining and that was a contributor to the sequential decline in CPC? Secondly, you recently indicated 50 million Chrome users and I think the Smart Phone shipments have been roughly 6 million per quarter run rate. Your thoughts on shipping a tablet to take advantage of this momentum? 
Patrick Pichette 

Let me answer in two ways. We are really delighted by the Chrome take up rate. It is a fast browser. It is a secure browser. It has all the elements that we have told about it. So this is a terrific opportunity. In terms of tablets, the one announcement we made last year that you will remember with the launch of Chrome OS is we are working with manufacturers to have a netbook out sometime in the fall. We are continuing to work diligently on this. We are very excited about it. We think there is going to be a ton of innovation coming out of that. So there is no doubt that we are pushing for it for all of the reasons you were mentioning. Can you remind me of your first question? 
 
Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley
The addition to the list earlier in terms of drivers of changes in CPC with the mix shift between site and network. As we go back and look at the sequential growth rate of Google Site revenue and Google Network revenue they were both basically flat. I was wondering if there was any implication from that CPC and one of those two actually changed more than the other? 
Patrick Pichette 

I don’t have the answer to that. What we will do is we will follow-up with you. 
Maria Shim 

I think we are done with questions so I am going to turn it over to Patrick for some closing thoughts. 
Patrick Pichette 

I just want to thank everybody for joining us today. I want to thank every Googler as well who listens to the call. We have Googlers all over the world working so diligently and creating these incredible products and all the options we have. Thanks for your time. We look forward to talking to you at the end of Q2. I will let the operator close the call.

Welcome everyone to the Google Inc. conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Maria Shim, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma’am. 
Maria Shim

Good afternoon everyone and welcome to today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009 conference call. With us are: Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of Product Management and Nikesh Arora, President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development.

Eric, Patrick, Jonathan and Nikesh will provide us with their thoughts on the quarter and full year and then we will take your questions. 
This call is being Web cast from our Investor Relations Web site located at Investor.Google.com.

As a reminder, we're holding two calls today. On this call we will discuss our strategic overview and Q&A with the usual format, followed by a second call, which is effectively an extended Q&A session with Jonathan and Patrick giving the opportunity for participants to ask more detailed financial and product questions in an efficient and Reg FD-compliant manner. The second call will begin at 3:00 pm Pacific Time and will also be webcast from our Investor Relations Web site.

Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding investments in our long-term growth and innovation, expected performance of our business and our expected levels of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. 

Please refer to our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, as well as our earnings press release for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our Web site. 

Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call, such as operating profit and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric.

Eric Schmidt

Thank you. Good afternoon to all and happy New Year. Welcome to our Q4 earnings call. This was a very strong quarter for Google and an extraordinary end to a roller coaster year by any means. 17% year-over-year revenue growth and we performed literally I think well across the board. 
We learned a lot in 2009. The strength of our management team, the talent of our employees, the pace of innovation within our product and engineering teams, if you take a look at the investments we made for example in Chrome and Chrome OS that we announced over the summer, the resilience of our business model and advertising dollars are scarce measurement matters even more. We tended to benefit more than we might have expected and that is great. We are optimistic about the future as a result. 
The economy continues to grow very rapidly. Specifically we are moving literally eyeballs of advertising online. We continue to benefit from that and our decisions to start ramping up our investments in Q3 which we talked about six months ago was clearly the right one so we will get the benefit of that in 2010. 
So we continue to invest heavily for the long-term, investing in design to maintain and increase Google’s pace of innovation. So where are we investing? Well we are obviously going to invest first in people. Engineering, best technical, best researchers and so forth and product sales in key markets across the country in all the ways that we have talked about before. 
The second investment is of course the technological innovation which is of course our core value proposition if we follow the 70/2010 which has worked so well for us. 70% in our established businesses; search with an emphasis on search quality as we continue on our quest which will never be fully realized to create the perfect search engine. We added, for example, real-time search in Q4 which has been very successful and more than 550 search quality enhancements in 2009, far more than one per day and it just continues to accelerate. 
Search advertising shift online as I talked about lots of growth in our core business as a result of that shift. Display we have talked about before and is now a huge opportunity for Google. 60 quality improvements in our display ads in the last year. YouTube great progress with our [TEPB] and music deals in Q4 which has been discussed already in the press. Enterprise business again very strong. Terrific momentum there as people move to the web based model with products that work very well. 
In the 20% area, newer businesses, these are newer businesses that fuel our search business. For example, mobile. Everybody knows about the success of Android, our search traffic increased 5 times in the past two years. The Droid and Nexus One show the power of the Android approach. Great devices, multiple partners, great features, [lost] for use cases. Again, a pretty clear success at this point. 
We also have our 10% long-view investments. Here we are interested in things like commerce and social initiatives which Jonathan will talk some more about. A third component for 2010 will be our positions, the pace of deals in Q4 shows we are at least on a path of one per month. We should expect that to continue. Some big, more small than big probably and designed to build upon our existing business the most obviously being Teracent and Double Click. 
We will also bring in new talent. If you look at like the Gizmo5 acquisition again. People with a unique expertise that we can use as part of our platform. So overall very pleased with the performance in Q4. We are back in business full blast and throughout 2009 if you look at it. We are investing heavily. We are excited about continuing to reinvent search which continues to be our core mission. 
I think with that why don’t we turn it over to Patrick and he will take us through the numbers. Patrick?
Patrick Pichette 

Thank you Eric. Good afternoon everyone. I will go through the financial results quickly and then turn it over to Jonathan and Nikesh for more details on our performance. 
We had a very strong finish to 2009. We are very pleased with the Q4 results and that gives us, as Eric said, the confidence have turned our focus to the growth opportunities in 2010 already making already in the back end of 2009 the necessary and significant investments to pursue those opportunities. 
So let’s go through the numbers quickly. Our gross revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $6.7 billion. Our business was strong across the board in search, display, apps and mobile. Nikesh will go into more detail on our performance in a few minutes on these matters. 
Google website revenue was up 16% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. We saw strong growth on Google.com across the world boosted by a very strong retail season, the economic recovery in many of our major geographies as well as some favorable FX. We also saw some impressive growth in YouTube revenues. Ad sense revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $2 billion driven primarily by solid performance in ad sense for search, strength in ad sense for content and growth in our display initiatives. 
Our global aggregate paid click growth remained healthy up 13% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter. The aggregate cost per click growth was also up 5% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year CPC growth was also positively impacted by some of the FX. Remember too this is an aggregate number which includes both Google and Ad sense properties and also includes diverse geographic markets some of which have lower CPCs. 
Turning to our geographic performance, revenue from the US was up 11% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. International revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue or $3.5 billion with about $8 million of benefits from hedging programs this quarter. The U.K. was up 13% year-over-year to $772 million and this despite a weak account in Q4 2009 compared to last year. Finally using fixed year-over-year exchange rates our international revenues would have been roughly $196 million lower. 
So let me turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition costs were $1.7 billion or 27% of total advertising revenue. Our other costs of revenue were $688 million including our stock based compensation of $6 million and finally all other operating costs totaled about $1.8 billion including approximately $270 million in stock based compensation. So on a year-over-year basis our OpEx excluding SBC was higher by $138 million and up $172 quarter-over-quarter. The increase both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter are primarily due to increases in marketing expense. 
As a result our non-GAAP operating profit which excludes the stock based compensation increased to $2.8 billion in Q4 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 41.3%. Our headcount was also slightly up at the end of the quarter approximately 20,000 full time employees and as Eric discussed we plan to continue to aggressively hire through this year particularly in engineering and sales. 
Let me turn for a moment to cash management. Our other income and expense was $88 million in Q4. For more details on OI&E please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23%. 
Turning to operating cash flow it was also very strong at $2.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $221 million again primarily related to our data center operations. We continue to make significant CapEx investments and these continue to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter depending on the timing of when we are able to make these investments. The net of all this is free cash flow quite strong at $2.5 billion for the quarter. 
In summary we are very pleased with the strong performance of Q4 across revenue, margins and cash flow. As we enter 2010 we are very excited about the opportunities our core business, display, mobile and apps and so you should expect us to continue to drive real investment in significant ways in the areas we believe have real long-term opportunities for Google and that will accelerate our pace of innovation. 
With that, thank you for your time. I will now turn it to Jonathan who despite you will hear quite a rough voice and a bad cold I can assure you he has all his regular expected energy. 
Jonathan Rosenberg 

Thank you Patrick. I will do my best. Naturally I think that part of our success this past year is the result of a very focused product strategy. At the beginning of 2009 our strategy was basically to double down on our core which was search, ad words and display and of course push on monetizing YouTube. We also wanted to invest in Chrome, Chrome OS and Geo and at the same time we made some very hard decisions to focus our resources. We shut down Lively, Notebook and our audio ads efforts. 
Internally we referred to this as the “more wood behind fewer arrows” approach. I think it worked for 2009. As we look back Ad words launched a whole new front end and several new ad formats that I think you can see are delivering results. Android started 2009 with just one device and is now at 20 in 48 countries. I am proudly carrying the gorgeous new Nexus One in my pocket. Double click is not fully integrated and display is ramping nicely. We open sourced a whole new operating system designed for the Internet area with Chrome OS. We also saw a steady stream of small businesses, large enterprises and lots of schools link to the cloud. YouTube is in fact it turns out monetizing well and we are helping lots of our partners who are working with us there make money. 
Most importantly search did particularly well in 2009. I think that might be the best example of what we feel we can do when we double down and focus. We launched 550 quality enhancements which Eric mentioned. We produced a much bigger and faster index. We expanded the capabilities of universal search and we added tools like the search options that let you work with your results to get to the best answer. 
We also launched music search and real-time search which are pretty amazing. I don’t’ know if any of you are actually in Northern California but we had this 4.1 earthquake a couple of weeks ago and my office shook while I was in it. Two minutes later Google Search was showing me people’s Tweets from all over the bay area talking about the quake that had just occurred and within minutes I was looking at news reports and the USGS data on the same quake. This looks easy but we had to build dozens of new search technologies so we could process the hundreds of millions of real-time changes that occur each day to make it happen. 
Eric mentioned in 2010 we are going to be investing so let me take a minute to talk about how we are thinking about making those investments. Of course we are going to pour a lot into search. The key there is always time to result. How fast can we get the user to the best answer for her or him whether that is a webpage, a map, a video, a twitter update or whatever it is. We are also going to work hard on making the ads richer, more diverse and more useful. We have talked about the single perfect ad and we mean that from the perspective of both the advertiser and the user at the same time. 
Beyond search and search ads I think we see a few major trends that are transforming the Internet and I think we are in a great position to compete in those areas too. The first is social. When you say social I think people think of social networks but really we believe the entire web is social. So we are going to look at making all of our products more social. We think you are more likely to trust a restaurant or a movie review from a friend of yours than from a stranger. So maybe it should be rated as a higher quality result but only for you. 
The Internet is also local and we see more and more of a business’s online presence is as important as its physical one so we are trying to make it easier for businesses to manage that presence and to connect with people who might actually be right around the corner and want to find them. The web has also always been about commerce and now more and more people who buy things offline are starting their shopping process and researching all that stuff online. We want to help those people decide what to get and where to get it whether it is offline or online. 
Personalization is also getting more important and we think mobile is a big part of that. More users both for search and other products are accessing us from mobile devices. With all the capabilities these phones that are coming out have like GPS, cameras, we think there is the potential to actually make this mobile web better than the PC web. Finally the shift from enterprise to online will accelerate and now we think organizations are moving to the cloud not because they save money but because it is actually a better way to run the business. They can do things in the cloud they simply can’t do in the old desktop world. 
So those are the trends that are guiding our product plans in 2010 and we think it is going to be an exciting year. We will certainly look forward to sharing our progress with you on future calls. With that I guess I will turn it over to Nikesh. 
Nikesh Arora 

Thank you Jonathan. This is an exciting quarter for us after a challenging year. 2009 started under a cloud of uncertainty but after three quarters of steadily improving performance I am pleased to report that we ended the year with a robust quarter in revenues. 
Let me take a quick few minutes to provide details and some examples of how advertisers can and have better leveraged their online marketing to reach their audiences. The first macro trend affecting all of our ad driven businesses with the continued driving adoption of online advertising by larger companies. In these tough economic times we saw bigger companies like Staples, Volvo, UBSoft,[apple labs] etc. turn an increasing proportion of their spend to what is a more measurable ROI of online advertising. They are basically shifting to where their audiences now spend their time. 
Looking globally we saw significant uptick in retail advertisers online spending. This is a change driven both by online retailers as well as traditional brick and mortar companies. Our sales teams took advantage of this trend and its strong showing on Black Friday and Cyber Monday which marked the start of the largest e-commerce holiday season in history. It is interesting to note remember search ads are always a better value in December. CPCs go up but CPAs go down because people buy more during that period. 
Let me give you a geographic flavor of how our revenues fared out around the world. Within the US the impact of the economic recovery is beginning to show particularly in sectors with a strong ROI focus. On the other side of the Atlantic U.K. companies in verticals that have been traditionally large spenders in offline have also increased their online ad budgets. If you shift to emerging markets we are very happy with our performance. In most of these markets we see very clear effects of underlying economic expansion again as well as the accelerating adoption of both search and online display advertising. 
For example, our Q4 growth in Brazil was particularly strong driven by efforts to educate the advertisers and the underpenetrated companies to help them understand the value of online advertising and what that represents in their overall marketing mix. 
The second big trend we are seeing is brand marketers continue to better understand the online display format and incorporate that into their campaigns. With our broad portfolio of products we are pleased with the performance of pretty much all four parts of our display strategy; YouTube, The Google Content Network, Double Click and our Ad Exchange. In YouTube we have had many successful brand advertising campaigns of note. 
One that you might have come across was Fox’s integrated media campaign for Avatar which used pretty much all four parts of our display strategy. If you haven’t seen it you can go to the web to YouTube and query Avatar and it will show you the interactive integrated multimedia channel with flash advertising and the movie trailer in Hi Def. 
We are also very excited about an event we held with American Express and Sony for World Aids Day where we streamed and hosted live Alicia Keyes benefit concert on YouTube. In the campaign American Express and Sony were able to reach millions of viewers in 167 countries around the world. 
Beyond YouTube brand advertisers continue to see the value of our million publishers and our content network and finally the ad exchange which we launched in Q3 continues to show good progress and is increasingly becoming an important part of display consistent with we believe most of the top networks are now signed onto the exchange. 
Third, as Jonathan mentioned we continue to see the global trend towards cloud computing speed up as companies grow more and more comfortable with hosted applications and our sales teams are working quickly to capitalize on these opportunities. We had key wins at Jaguar and National Geographic as one of our most comprehensive deals for the City of Los Angeles which moved 30,000 users to Google Apps. 
So against these major commercial wins we have signed educational deals with Virginia Tech and Fresno State while both small and medium sized business continue to adopt Google Apps. Finally with the trends that Jonathan mentioned, the penetration of smart phones and other mobile devices our sales teams are continuing to work with advertisers who can reach and target their customers through mobile advertising like never before. 
One campaign of specific note was done by Razorfish, an agency partner of ours, who used a targeted mobile campaign to improve conversion rates towards monetary retail clients by approximately 10%. So we continue to see promise in this area. 
Now I am going to turn it over to Patrick to set up the question period. 
Patrick Pichette 

Thank you Nikesh. So everybody will remember in our last call we had set up a question page online to sort out through the questions and answers. Through your feedback and actually having tested that we prefer to actually go back to our more traditional mode. Thanks for actually having tried with us in the spirit of innovation. I will turn it over to Connie to set up the call for questions. 

Question and Answer Session

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs. 
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
It looked like your US revenue accelerated from 4% year-over-year in the third quarter to 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter which was great while your international growth accelerated from 19% in the third quarter to 21% in the fourth quarter. 21% is still a big number but not as sharp an acceleration. I wonder if the discrepancy was due to any of the following; First, the US having easier comps than international from a year ago? Secondly the monetization improvements you made in the US that you haven’t yet rolled out internationally? Third, the fact that display advertising is benefiting your US business more than your international business at this point? 
Nikesh Arora 

The US as I mentioned earlier we have been able to see the continued shift of large advertisers which started in Q3 and continued into Q4 and has been reasonably strong. On the international side I am very pleased with the growth we have seen across the world but you have to understand there is a mix issue. There are different parts of the world which grow at different paces and while we continue to see growth in most markets there are some markets where we are seeing growth like Brazil as I mentioned which are causing that growth rate to look different than the US.

The next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney – Citigroup. 

Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
The sequential growth is actually very similar to what you had in 2007. Is it pretty clear to you that overall search spending trends are kind of back to the normal seasonal patterns or are there still verticals that still seem weak to you, not retail obviously but other areas? Secondly, the materiality of mobile could you talk about any data points of sequential growth in search, what percentage of searches are off mobile devices in any particular markets? 
Eric Schmidt 

Just in general we won’t comment about the mobile and how it affects our total revenue. In general there is clearly you see through the second half of 2009 a recovery in economic activity worldwide and that clearly has shown up in our results. I will let Nikesh give you more specifics. 
Nikesh Arora 

From a vertical perspective as I mentioned we have seen very strong send in the retail vertical across the board pretty much around the world. We have also continued to see strength in the technology vertical. As you might expect finance is not as strong as it was in 2007 and we are seeing stabilization in some amount of recovery. In addition to that we continue to make progress with all the other verticals like CPC, health, etc.

The next question comes from the line of Benjamin Schachter - Broadpoint Am Tech.
Benjamin Schachter - Broadpoint Am Tech
Could you rank the key monetization changes you made in Q4 and how do you think they are going to impact the model going forward? Then on mobile I just wonder if you could have a broader discussion about how you think about the P&L there. Is this something you want to drive revenues? Is this something you just want to push the internet experience forward on mobile? Finally any comment on China and the situation there? 
Jonathan Rosenberg 

I guess I can just start with the quality question specifically. Q4 tends to be a modest quarter for us quality wise. We had about a dozen launches but the dynamic that we have there is we try to freeze the launches after Thanksgiving so we had stability for our advertisers around the holiday period. So from an overall impact on RPM perspective the quality launches are actually more modest. Some of the apps changes that we made, site links, comparison ads and product extensions certainly started to take effect as did the fact that all of our advertisers are now on Ad Words 3 which we think is allowing them to be much more effective in terms of their bidding efforts. 
I would generally describe the quarter as relatively modest from a quality perspective. Nikesh and others could give you their perspective on Mobile. The main thing I think we are starting to see there is that advertisers are getting better at figuring out what kind of ads work on the mobile devices. The simple addition, for example, of things like including a phone number or an offer is substantially increasing the click through rates and the ROI for the subset of advertisers who are correctly optimizing their mobile campaigns. So we are certainly seeing very strong growth there. 
Patrick Pichette 

To close on mobile there really is a two-pronged strategy on it which is driving innovation in an ecosystem on one side. So when you think of all of the applications like goggles and all of what you have seen on voice recognition and navigation that is all innovation that basically drives people to the web with these new mobile applications. Obviously the more people spend their time on it then they trigger into search and then monetization. From that perspective I think that is the core engine of the mobile model. 
On China I suggest that Eric answer that one. 
Eric Schmidt 

I think the China stuff has been covered really quite well in the press. Just a review for everybody on the call, we announced a little more than a week ago three reasonably separate facts. One, that there had been a cyber attack on Google probably emanating from China with the origin details unknown. It is still under investigation. We believe we have made the necessarily technical changes to prevent such a future attack. 
The second was we discovered perhaps related or perhaps unrelated monitoring of human rights activists which we disclosed in the spirit of people be aware this may be occurring. Then the third was a decision for those reasons and other reasons for Google to no longer be willing to apply the censorship rules in China. This has a bunch of consequences. One of course is that we are in conversations with the Chinese government. 
The second is our business in China is today unchanged. We continue to follow their laws. We continue to offer censored results. A reasonably short time from now we will be making some changes there. We have made a strong statement we wish to remain in China. We like the Chinese people. We like our Chinese employees. We like the business opportunities there and we would like to do that on somewhat different terms than we have. But we remain quite committed to being there. I hope that helps.

The next question comes from the line of  Justin Post – BAS-ML
Justin Post – BAS-ML
My question is more on competitive issues in search. It looks like US did accelerate where I would expect to have the biggest impact but are you seeing any share changes internationally related to any of your competitive initiatives? Secondly on the partner environment are you seeing more competitive pressure on signing up partners given some of the initiatives of your competitors out there? 
Eric Schmidt 

On the competition question I think it is better for us to focus on what we do and not what our competitors are doing. I think our results speak for themselves and I will let you judge how they are doing in a market that is a highly competitive market. The one area where there is probably a pretty big competitive even is whatever happens in China which at this point is obviously unknown and that would clearly make a difference. 
Nikesh Arora 

We continue to work closely with our partners both on the search and display side. Most of our partnerships are based on very clear ROI and very clear benefits to partners and to us. We haven’t seen any change from our partner experiences from Q3 to Q4. 
Patrick Pichette 

In fact on the content side the announcement of Vivo, the announcement of Channel 4 and Channel 5 in the U.K. for YouTube has in fact been an increase and we are very pleased about these types of partnerships.

The next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital. 
Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital
 I was wondering if you could comment on the relative outperformance of the network business versus O&O and if there is any particular dynamics in there that make network growth higher? Then secondly can you also comment on the higher marketing costs you saw during the quarter and in particular how much of that is attributable to Android launches and the Droid in particular?
Patrick Pichette 

In terms of O&O versus network, nothing really significant to disclose in this quarter. On marketing I think it is fair to say there are two things there; there is a high level and then I will let Nikesh give a couple of comments. At the higher level remember when we said at the end of Q3 we wanted to ramp up our investment in certain areas to accelerate our growth. Marketing is one that you can actually affect in the short-term quite well. Because we have such a scientific approach to it to track it we decided to invest a bit more in Q4. Nikesh can probably give you a couple of examples on that. 
Nikesh Arora 

For example many of our marketing efforts in Q4 had been targeted towards trying to educate and bring more and more small advertisers into the web where we can clearly measure the ROI and clearly understand what the impact of those is. So that has been one big focus. The other big focus on the consumer side has just been support some more of our more consumer launches that have happened in Q4. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Imran Khan - JP Morgan.
Imran Khan - JP Morgan.
You talked about search traffic increase to five times on mobile. I am trying to understand that economics. What kind of revenue per search on mobile are you seeing compared to the PC and secondly a couple of more related questions on the cost side. You talked about the spend more on the marketing in Q4. Is it more of a one-time nature? Do you expect that to do down in Q1? Also how much were bonus accruals for Q4 due to exiting your full year plan? Should we think the bonus accrual will go down in Q1?
Patrick Pichette 

Let me start with bonus and then we will go back to the other question of marketing. On bonus here is what everybody has to remember. Last year you will remember there was a lot of questions about that. When we start the year we reset the plan and as we progress through the year if we vary the plan whether positive or negative then we have to make additional accruals but in the beginning of the year we just don’t know that. So in 2010, next quarter you can expect we will reset our plan and therefore we will go back to the base number. 
For this year, 2009 specifically, we had actually by Q3 figured out we had a different trajectory than the base plan and what we did as a consequence is actually did a combination of cash between Q3 and Q4 to make sure we were properly provisioned for the bonus at year-end. That is why you haven’t seen like at the end of Q4 of last year a big blip for that reason. We will increase it but just in proportion to the second half of the year. So that is the key on bonus. 
On marketing I think the issue from a financial perspective clearly we don’t give any perspective view on marketing. I think the most important thing is that we are really pleased with the experiments we are running right now in the marketing. Again, I will circle back to Nikesh to see if he wants to give more precision on it. 
Nikesh Arora 

I am just going to echo what Patrick had said. We are going to look at the campaigns we have in place and we are going to look at the products we have in place and based on the ROI of those campaigns we are going to ratchet our spending up or not in the following quarters. 
Jonathan Rosenberg 

I am not going to give specifics on mobile RPMS versus desktop RPMs but I think the main thing we can say is the new formats, the targeting tools and the reporting we are giving the mobile advertisers is making the huge difference. I mentioned Click to Call putting phone numbers in the mobile ads making a difference. Try something like auto insurance on your phone and you will see that the Progressive ad on the phone actually shows the phone number while on the PC it doesn’t. Nikesh gave the Razorfish example in his opening remarks and we are also letting the advertisers target high end devices, specific devices or specific carriers and we have also launched the reporting with analytics to the mobile phones. We are starting to see much improved monetization in general across mobile. 
Operator

The next question comes from the line of Brian Pitz – UBS. 
Brian Pitz – UBS
Over the past couple of quarters you have rolled out several new ad formats such as site link and video ads on the Google.com site. Could you discuss the adoption of these formats among advertisers and any commentary on if these formats have potentially lowered page clicks and increased CPCs on the site? 
Nikesh Arora 

The ad formats we launched in Q4 have been very successful. The advertisers have taken them up very effectively. We have actually used our direct sales force across the US as well as across many parts of Europe and work with some of our larger advertisers to include site links to their mobile format. I will pass the CPC question back to Patrick. 
Patrick Pichette 

We won’t comment about the specifics on each one of them but it is very clear when you have product listing ads that have either new cost for action pricing models as that includes images and pricing within them or even the comparison ad that we now kind of started introducing, all of these obviously provide more information to the user and therefore more value. From that perspective it has been a real positive. 
Jonathan Rosenberg 

For people that are confused, the easiest way for them to see what we are talking about is just try typing something like Sears into Google and you will see the example of what Nikesh was referring to in ad site links. It is intuitively easy to how they lead to higher user engagement. You will see the electronics and tools section, the deal of the day and you can see how much of a better experience that is both for the advertiser and for the user.

The next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse. 
Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse
My question is regarding YouTube monetization. I know you have talked about being happy with the monetization at YouTube. I was wondering if you could just give us perhaps some updated metrics on how much of YouTube is being monetized. In previous calls you said that it was triple year-over-year. Any update on that would be great. 
Eric Schmidt 

We are not going to give any specific metrics on YouTube. What I can say is the big shift we are continuing to see on YouTube is that it has gone from being a nice to have to an essential part of the media mix of any display campaign that our advertisers are planning. That is a big shift from our perspective and we continue to see people and you can look at YouTube and it is very easy to see, you can see that our own big ad there and the watch page ads are on there and we have been able to expand that across the world in many markets where we have YouTube in place. 
Patrick Pichette 

Just to close, when people think of key insights on YouTube the homepage was nearly sold out in Q4 and that was a great testimony of the power of YouTube and we are now running ads in 20 countries worldwide so again to give you a sense of perspective of how successful YouTube has been.

The next question comes from the line of Scott [Davis] – Morgan Stanley. 
Scott [Davis] – Morgan Stanley
There was data in the quarter that suggested that large branded retailers grew online sales at that roughly 15% quarter and the smaller retailers experienced slower growth. Given your broad visibility into ad spending and particularly the long tail in smaller advertisers I am wondering if you can just comment on ad spending trends by advertiser size? 
Nikesh Arora 

As I alluded to this earlier our largest advertisers continue to increase their online spending and operating search and online display in their marketing mix. So the retail has been particularly strong during the holiday season. Most of the large retailers have created very robust websites and they are able to target a very, very large host of keywords and have to some degree automated this stuff. We continue to work with some of our smaller advertisers and bring them into the fray. It is purely a mix issue and a seasonal issue where we have seen the larger advertisers outperform the smaller ones.

The next question comes from the line of Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart. 
Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart
Can you please rank your non-core search businesses in term of the growth potential? i.e. display, YouTube, mobile and ads? Then also any color you can add on your partnership/competitive dynamics with Google and Apple? 
Eric Schmidt 

It depends on whether you are looking at absolute growth or percentage growth. Obviously the smaller ones are going to grow faster than the larger ones. We have said for a pretty long time the next huge business for us is display and we put in place a series of acquisitions and a series of products. We have integrated them and we are seeing the benefit. I think one of the stories that has not really come out yet is how successful Google is at display. I think you will see that especially in 2010. 
So if I were to talk about absolute numbers that are not search I would say that is probably your number one. Obviously the smaller ones will grow faster on a relative basis. There the most obvious one in terms of growth rate would be mobile and a lot of that depends on the competitive dynamics of the industry, how successful the new AFMA product from us is, the AdMob acquisition if that comes through. We have a lot of evidence that people are moving to these data friendly mobile devices very, very, very quickly. Our search traffic growth rate is quite a bit faster than on PCs. We expect that to continue. So for lots of reasons 2010 will be a year of significant mobile revenue growth for the whole industry. I am sure we will be able to play a major part of that. 
With respect to Apple it is probably better to say that Apple, I as a former board member have a special spot for Apple in my heart but I will tell you Apple is a very well run company. They have a lot of very good stuff coming. We have a couple of very good partnerships with them and we also compete with them in a couple of areas. My guess is that is a pretty stable situation for awhile.

The next question comes from the line of Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities
Taking a step back you have a $23 billion business built around advertising and it seems like it has some sensitivity to the macroeconomic environment these days. Broadly as you look forward and the broader ecosystem of consumers and business partners you work with are there newer, more unique ways of adding value to the broader ecosystem in terms of new revenue, models or business models that are kind of worthwhile exploring as you look ahead and to try to break away from the sensitivity of the ad business that seems to be tied to macro. Second, on mobile your strategy seems to be a little bit perplexing in you have a partnership strategy with your handset OEMs and then Nexus One. 
Is that a comparison of network and O&O? Is that how we should think about the evolution of that strategy or are you just trying to push the smart phone category and be obviously the interface brand that consumers use to access information through those devices? 
Eric Schmidt 

On your question about the macro we said last year and reiterate we are not immune to global economic trends. I think the evidence would say we fared better than most companies in a global economic downturn and the hopeful global recovery that is clearly underway at this point. We have seen that for six months or maybe longer. I am not so worried about our reliance on ads which is sort of the premise of your question. From our perspective our goal as a business is to solve the advertisers and the other business problems which is ultimately about selling products, marketing and so forth. 
We are in various conversations about trying to do alternative ways to distribute additional content. We are trying to come up with new ways of using GPS data so an advertiser gets position in place, we have a lot of initiatives in this category. The ones where we probably have the biggest impact or not impact as much as those are exciting, will probably be in the display area because in aggregate size our display business will give people an opportunity to reach people with visual stories and reach them with narratives which they couldn’t do with search text. 
So it is probably the case that the combination of local advertising, all of the things we are doing in display plus some of these new and more speculative things are likely to drive a lot of new ways of solving a business problems. We also haven’t talked much about this but we have quite a healthy enterprise business that is going to grow we think quite rapidly over the next few years as people move from the older legacy PC centric traditional operating system model to the new web-based application model. The trend there is clear. Everyone is moving there and we are going to be one of the leaders there.
Patrick Pichette 

Do you want to comment on the issue of mobile and the question about the perplexity of our business model? 
Eric Schmidt 

The second part of your question is on Nexus One and that model. There has been a lot of confusion about that. It is probably easiest to understand it the following way: What the Nexus One is really about is a new way of buying a phone. The Nexus One is simply the first of a series of examples where you can essentially purchase a phone online from one or multiple manufacturers order it and have it just work. We think that is a natural evolution of a particular model. It does not exclude the other models and I think it is comparable with the retail model and seems to be quite successful. 
So far our partners have understood that message and they have been okay with it and the Nexus One itself of course is a magnificent product.

Jason Helfstein – Oppenheimer & Co.

Do you think Bing is having an impact on cost per click? Then, do you expect the tax rate to rise in 2010 with the improvement in US revenues? 
Patrick Pichette 

Let me answer the second one first and we can come back to the first one. On the issue of taxation obviously we don’t give any kind of guidance forward. We continue to monitor very closely all the issues related to those tax bills and the legislation. Obviously we are like most American companies that have a large international presence we continue to believe it would be a disadvantage to having some of the proposals that are on the table. We are going to continue to participate in the process very actively and make our voice heard. We can’t speculate as to the outcomes of these things. 
In terms of Bing, Jonathan do you want to give a comment on it? 
Jonathan Rosenberg 

We generally don’t comment on competitors. We think our CPCs are not generally impacted by what other search engines do. Our CPCs are set by competition among advertisers and we have a very competitive auction market. 
Patrick Pichette 

That is the essence of the point. People choose.

The next question comes from the line of Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray. 
Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray 
Can you talk a little bit about the impact of Nexus One in the model specifically to margins going forward? 
Patrick Pichette 

In its most simplistic form we don’t track percentage margins as part of our business model. What we are looking for is opportunities to innovate, to shift product we think really are disruptive and then changing them to the benefit of users and the Nexus One is a great example of that in setting the bar as to what a great mobile handset should look like and it will have its own margin. That is how we are focused on building the business.

The next question comes from the line of Mark May - Needham & Company. 
Mark May - Needham & Company
We have been hearing from a number of ad sense partners that Google’s TAC rate is trending towards Google’s favor. Is the fourth quarter TAC decline a reflection of a declining trend in TAC or is it just seasonal? The second question is I think investors have a good sense of the assets and such that Google brings to bear in the online display space but doesn’t have a good sense of the size of Google’s display business and the trend in market share there. The question is how big in fact is Google in display today? 
Patrick Pichette 

Let me start with the TAC issues. We have a lot of great partnerships with so many of our ad sense partners and other partners. The fact that it has been trending down has to do simply with mix issues and it is not really tied to seasonality. There is nothing of a big surprise there in our mind and we continue to have great partnerships with all of our partners on ad sense and others. 
In the case of display, I think that the two facts we shared already on the last webcast are worth mentioning is the industry itself is a $17 billion industry so it is a big pie and if you just take the TV advertising industry which is $170 billion industry that is all ad buyers that are shifting over time to the internet or digital content. That is also going to make its, some of it is going to make its way progressively to display. 
So there is no doubt it is a huge pie to go after. From our side we clearly don’t comment on the specifics of our market share or our revenue dollars but I think you should take from the tonality of Eric’s comments that this is really a good focus for us because it has a lot of runway. I will leave it at that if you don’t mind.

The next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Co. 
Youssef Squali – Jefferies & Co. 
On mobile we have seen some third party data the iPhone may account for as much as 50% of overall mobile traffic. First, is that kind of similar to what you are hearing or what you have seen? Related to that you said earlier or mentioned that you see the Apple relationship as stable. Are we inferring from that you think the upcoming renegotiations of that deal and potential of it moving to a competitor likely to move in your favor? On the display side can you give us a sense of the percentage of search advertisers that are buying display from  you today and is the major push back from those that don’t? 
Eric Schmidt 

We are not going to speculate on the market share of Apple mobile products. That is for Apple to discuss with you. As far as I can tell our business structures with Apple are quite stable. I am not going to speculate on any deals of any kind, rumored, true, not true, you name it we are not going to talk about it. On the display question? 
Nikesh Arora 

On the display side there is a reasonable number of our search advertisers who also buy display. It actually depends on their campaign objectives. If their campaign objectives are direct response oriented and favor search as well as certain parts of the display which would give them a higher conversion rate and a higher clicks rate as it relates to their advertising. The more brand focused they tend to only display in their campaigns. That category clearly they have many choices including YouTube as far as where they spend their premium brand dollars.

The next question comes from the line of Marianne Wolk – Susquehanna Financial. 
Marianne Wolk – Susquehanna Financial 
Given how attractive you are making the new display products to advertisers and the big push with your sales force, have you seen any of your advertisers shift budget from search into the newer display offering? As a follow-up how do we think about what is going on in the content network? Where are you in transforming that from basically contextual advertising to display? 
Eric Schmidt 

On the question of shifting my experience with advertisers is they don’t shift an ad. The reason is that the decisions they make are sort of standalone. In other words they will simply maximize the amount of search advertising they do to maximize their revenue. A display decision is a decision they make which is both a revenue and also strategic decision around their branding and so forth. That is growing as we can offer, if you will, the science that Google applies to the display business. That is our differentiator. We do it better than anybody else and that is why we continue to win all those deals. 
Patrick Pichette 

We are going to close on this for now. I want to thank everyone for taking the time to listen to our call today. As you can tell we are very excited about moving the business forward in 2010. I want to take a moment to thank also all of the Googler’s who have been listening to this call for their hard work. 2009 was a roller coaster year, very strong performance and really the achievement of everybody on the team. On behalf of the management team thank you to all. Thank you for listening. Jonathan and I will talk to you in half an hour.

Good day and welcome, everyone, to the Google Inc. conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Maria Shim, Director of Investor Relations.
Maria Shim
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's third quarter 2009 conference call. 
With us are: Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of Product Management; and Nikesh Arora -  President, Global Sales Operations and Business Development.
Today we are trying a new process on our earnings call. Eric, Patrick, Jonathan, and Nikesh will each provide us with their thoughts on the quarter and then we will take Q&A from Google Moderator. This is our first time using Google Moderator to respond to questions from the investment community, so let be briefly explain the process.
Please submit your questions via the Moderator page that we have sent out and the audience will vote on the most relevant questions. We will only be taking questions that are relevant to today's earnings results and Google's long-term strategy. 
I will read the question and the name of the person who submitted the question and then have Eric, Patrick, Jonathan, or Nikesh answer.
This call is being Web cast from our Investor Relations Web site located at Investor.Google.com. Please refer to our Web site for important information, including our earnings press release, issued a few minutes ago, along with slides that accompany today's prepared remarks. A replay of this call will also be available on our Web site in a few hours. 
Please note that we routinely post important information on our Investor Relations W Web site located at Investor.Google.com and we encourage you to make use of that resource.
As a reminder, we're holding two calls today. On this call we will discuss our strategic overview and Q&A with the usual format, followed by a second call, which is effectively an extended Q&A session with Jonathan and Patrick, giving the opportunity for participants to ask more detailed financial and product questions in an efficient and Reg FD-compliant manner. The second call will begin at 3:00 pm Pacific Time and will also be Web cast from our Investor Relations Web site.
Let me now quickly cover the safe harbor.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Schmidt
Good afternoon to all of you and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. 
Let's start by summarizing where we are. You know, while there is obviously a lot of uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery, we believe the worst of the recession is behind us and we're seeing lots of signs of that in all of the industries that we pay attention to. So we're very optimistic now about the future. We now have the business confidence to invest heavily in the next phase of innovation, hoping to invent the future as we see it. 
Our performance in the quarter was a strong quarter. 7% year-over-year revenue growth. We performed well across all of the financial metrics of the Monitor, so it's all good news from our perspective, at least in looking at the quarter. And we're going to continue to invest in long-term growth. We tested our management team and I want to say that I'm very, very proud of the management team getting us through what could have been a very significant position for Google and we've proven the worth of this team.
Tight control over costs, combined with continued innovation in search and ads, Chrome and Android, mobile, these huge opportunities ahead of us, the resources and expertise to invest heavily in long-term growth for the benefit of users, customers, and shareholders.
So how are we investing? Well, we're going to invest in people. We're already stepping up our hiring. And also in innovation consistent with our 70-20-10 principles. The technological precondition for growth, if you will, is this investment in innovation.
In the 70%, everybody here on the call I think knows, that that's our core business. We want to really get to the perfect search engine. We made about 120 search quality improvements in the third quarter with more, of course, coming this quarter and then we hope every quarter. 
And we're working to create much better ads. It's important to remember that many of our advertisers would like to find more ways to spend money with Google if our products would allow them to do that. And we want to make that possible and really serve their needs.
And that 20% out of the 70-20-10, we're stepping up our investment in up-and-coming businesses. Mobile, a high-growth business for us already. 30% quarter-over-quarter growth in mobile searches in the third quarter. 
Android, as you know, has come a long way in a year, from one device with one carrier in one country and now 12 devices in 26 countries with 32 carriers with much more coming.
In the display and YouTube area, both which, of course, are doing well, we have a great base. We have a million publishers choosing to use the AdSense product. And of course many, many AdWords advertisers. And we've now added Double Click to the mix, integrated with Google with our exchange and all of the things Double Click can now offer. So you have a great business, it should scale pretty rapidly.
And again, even with our enterprise business, which we've been working hard on for some time, not only is our business accelerating, but I actually personally spoke to a number of our customers, for example, Motorola, Genentech, and Johnson Diversity, getting feedback very strong. They need more of this product and they need us to address product shortcomings, and I think the products will do very, very well.
In the 10%, promising areas where we think there is a real opportunity to innovate, Google inspired development by basically pushing our breadth of hiring, partnerships with wireless and developers, but also we're going to focus more on strategic deals and acquisitions, as we have discussed publicly. And we're open for business in making strategic acquisitions, both large and small.
So to put it together and I think it over to Patrick for his analysis of his financials, I will tell you that we are very, very happy with Q3. The worst of the recession clearly behind us and because of what we have seen we now have the confidence to be optimistic about our future and we're going to invest as a result, and that I think is ultimately good for the long term of Google.
Patrick Pichette
So I will go through the results quickly and then I will turn it over to Nikesh and Jonathan for a bit more detail on our performance.
As Eric said, at a high level, we are very pleased with our Q3 results. Gross revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $5.9 billion and our business was strong across the board. At Google.com, for example, the revenue was up 8% year-over-year to $4.0 billion, contributing a significant portion of our year-over-year growth. The traffic growth continues to be healthy, and we saw stabilization or improvement in most of our major markets.
It is actually worth noting that Q3 also benefitted from a number of Ads Quality launches. 
In AdSense we saw an increase, up year-over-year 7% to $1.8 billion, driven primarily by growth in our AdSense for content and our display initiatives. Our global aggregate growth remained very healthy, up 14% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter.
Our aggregate cost per-click growth was down 6% year-over-year but up 5% quarter-over-quarter with FX playing quite a factor in both the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter comparisons. So FX had a negative impact on the year-over-year for CPC growth but a positive one quarter-over-quarter due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter. Remember, too, that this is an aggregate number, which includes diverse geographic markets, some of which may have lower CPCs and also includes both Google and AdSense properties.
Turning to our geographic performance, revenue from the U.S. was up 4% year-over-year to $2.8 billion. International revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue, or $3.1 billion, with $39.0 million benefits of hedging programs for this quarter.
The U.K. was down 1% year-over-year to $765.0 million, negatively impacted by FX as well as an ongoing macroeconomic weakness, but this was partially offset by revenues from our hedging program.
It is worth noting that using a fixed year-over-year exchange rate, our total revenue would have been roughly $300.0 million higher.
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $1.6 billion, or 27% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $667.0 million. And finally, all other operating expenses totaled $1.6 billion, including approximately $303.0 million for our stock based compensation.
On a year-over-year basis, our opex, excluding SBC and other cost of sales, was lower by $14.0 million and up $81.0 million quarter-over-quarter. The increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to increases in payroll, equipment, and facilities-related expenses.
So as a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock based compensation, increased to $2.4 billion in Q3, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 40.2%.
Headcount was slightly down, ending the quarter with approximately 20,000 full-time employees. 
So as Eric said, we believe the worst of the recession is behind us and we feel confident in investing in our innovation agenda in a targeted and disciplines way, and that includes accelerating hiring across the organization, particularly in engineering and sales.
Let me now turn to cash management. In other income and expense we had a net expense of $7.0 million for Q3. For more details on this, please refer to the slide that are accompanying this call on our Investor Relations Web site.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21% and let me remind you that any changes to the mix of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries, as well as the effect on our earnings from various hedging activities and the related items, obviously have an effect on our tax rate.
So let's complete the report right now. Operating cash flow very strong at $2.7 billion. Capex for the quarter was $186.0 million, again, primarily related to our data center operations and we will continue to make significant capex investments, although they're lumpy. Free cash flow, very strong at $2.5 billion.
So in summary, very pleased with a strong quarter in Q3, across revenue, margins, and cash flow. We are managing the company to best position ourselves for long-term growth and accelerating our pace of innovation. We're disciplined but fully investing in big, long-term opportunities, whether it be in search, display, mobile, or apps.
With that, I will turn it over to Nikesh to cover with more color commentary.
Nikesh Arora
I just wanted to spend a few minutes going over our performance across our businesses and our markets. Firstly, our core business continues to drive our growth. If you look at our performance across our four global regions, in the Americas the U.S. trend was across the board, but especially amongst our larger advertisers as they have come back into the market in the third quarter. We've had a major push in the U.S. to further streamline our sales processes and go out and meet most of our large advertising CMOs.
In addition to the large advertisers, Brazil was a good performer and a good stand-out in Latin America with strong revenue growth.
If you look at our region which covers Northern and Central Europe, we have begun to see stabilization across the board as economies started to emerge from the downturn. The U.K. has showed strength for us in the last quarter. 
Our third region that includes Southern and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, we also saw solid performance from that region. Particularly Spain has shown strong signs of revival, fueled by the travel of retail and automotive verticals.
Our fourth region, Asia Pacific and Japan, we continue to build and strengthen our teams. China was a strong performer as an emerging market and Japan has seen some benefits from reorg of the sales team, the mobile growth, and a more favorable economic climate.
If you look at our partnerships over the last quarter, we have had a strong level of AdSense renewals and new agreements which include British Telecom, Discovery, Distro, and e-Bay, with whom we have signed a global deal. This deal with e-Bay renews our long-standing partnership with them on their non-U.S. properties as well as their classified and shopping sites. In addition, it also extends the partnership for the first time to e-Bay.com.
Now if you turn over to our display business, as Eric mentioned earlier, we made a lot of progress across all three parts of our display business, which have strong results. Firstly, in our owner-operated properties, we are pleased with our progress. On YouTube we have added new partners and advertisers and further improved monetization. Today we can say that 90% of the top 50 adage advertisers have run campaigns with successful results on YouTube. Hewlett Packard used YouTube home page, promoted videos, [inaudible] as well as content network and search for its back-to-school campaign. It has at over 2.7 million channels users in 170 countries with over 6,600 subscribers and 4,000 submissions. Recently Palm used the YouTube home page and its YouTube channel as well as the common network in a recent campaign. And McDonald's also ran a YouTube video ad on the home page to promote its McCafe product.
On the partnership side of YouTube we signed some important partnerships with Time Warner and Warner Music during our third quarter. We now have deals with four major record labels and publishers, along with many independent labels, bringing more premium content to the site. This morning we announced that we had partnered with Channel 4 in the U.K. to bring full content TV to YouTube.
Generally, we are developing successful expertise and selling home pages, and now we are in the process of relieving free-hold inventory which is an area we expect to further drive monetization.
If you look at the second part of our display business, which is our content network, we continue the show of healthy growth. We continue to focus on publisher acquisition and improving the monetization of our network. Specifically, we are attracting key advertisers for both direct response and branding campaigns. As Eric mentioned, we have now over 1.0 million publishers in our AdSense network.
The third part of our display business, which is beyond our network, we are very excited to announce the new Double Click ad exchange this quarter. The ad exchange is a key part of how we can open a display ecosystem. It's introduction is already being received very positively by both ad networks and publishers with contractual commitments from major partners and migrations from the original Double Click ad exchange, already near completed in several countries. Over half of the largest 25 ad networks in the U.S. are already using the new ad exchange.
It also provides substantial benefits by giving our AdWords advertisers access to more high-quality inventory enabling third parties to advertise on our AdSense publishers' sites.
In our enterprise business we continue to push forward. We have had some big customers wins in the last quarter, including Rentokil which has 35,000 users, [inaudible] cycles 17,000 users, and Clinica with 7,000 users. We are also seeing lots of traction among small and medium-sized businesses, which continue to increase at a fast pace.
Lastly, on a personal note, I want to say I am very pleased with the performance of our sales team this quarter, because this quarter we have transitioned many of our senior leaders but the team has maintained its focus on going out there and driving sales and we continue to invest in our emerging business in emerging markets and we hope to continue to do that in line with Patrick's and Eric's comments.
With that, I'm going to hand it over to Jonathan for product insights for the quarter.
Jonathan Rosenberg
So Eric mentioned that we're investing in long-term growth, and you will remember, of course, that we said we would take the long-term focus in our founder's letter, and I think recently we've really been pushing a number of investments and big bets that are consistent with that long-run principle. So what I want to try to do is just quickly walk you through a few of those examples.
One of the biggest 2009 investments is the new AdWords Front End and we transitioned pretty much all of our advertisers to the new user interface this quarter. And it was really the biggest overhaul to AdWords which we've ever done and the advertisers now have lots of new reports, they're running much, much more efficient campaigns and we have a new infrastructure that will make it much easier for us to roll out new features moving forward.
We are also making a big investment push in developing new ad formats and we are beta testing a new ad offering which we call local listing ads. And with that you basically sign up with just a simple one-page form. You don't have to deal with key words, you don't have to deal with bids to manage. There's a simple flat monthly rate. And if you don't have a Web page, the ad can link to your place page, and that's a free page that we generate and you can edit. It has all sorts of information about your business. And we've launched about 50.0 million of these place pages. And the phone numbers on the ads go through Google Voice so you can actually track the calls you get and you know which ones were generated by your Google ad. The call actually comes in and it literally says, ""This call brought to you by Google."" And the trial is right now just in San Francisco and San Diego, but if you enter ""coffee, San Francisco"" you can actually see one of the ads.
Last week we also launched a new maps data set and we're now using that in the U.S. and Mexico. This was a huge investment but it's going to give us a lot more flexibility to create new types of maps. If you think about it, if you're a tourist you probably want a different kind of a map than if you're a local. And now we're going to be able to have the base to build in features like that.
I also sometimes hear that it's not always obvious how some of our big product investments tie together. If you look here at what we're doing with maps and local, you will see that we have the ads infrastructure, geographical data, Google Voice, and place pages and those things are now all working together to create a very compelling solution for small local businesses. So everything is now really finally in place for local businesses to easily connect with customers online.
And we're also investing a lot in user experience and the whole underlying infrastructure that's needed to support it. We see users today come to us with much, much harder queries than they used to so we're adding more ways for them to work with the results and to get what they need. 
We launched a bunch of new features in search options. That's the little ""show options"" toggle switch which you'll see it in the blue bar above your search result. And now you can opt to just look at the results from, say, the past hour or whatever time period that you want. So if you're researching an upcoming purchase, like you want to buy a camera or something, we have a ""fewer shopping sights feature"" and you can filter out many of the commercial sites if you just want to look at more reviews, but then later you can opt to see more shopping sites, which shows you the more commercial sites, along with their prices.
Eric and Nikesh mentioned the display business. That's going very well but we think it's still a highly inefficient industry. Something like 25% of all the publishers' ad space still goes unsold. So we've launched a new Double Click ad exchange and this was a big investment and project and a key milestone in the culmination of the Double Click acquisition. Our goal there is basically to increase the size of the pipe for everyone, advertisers, agencies, ad networks, and publishers.
And finally, we're placing some big, big bets on making the Web better. We shipped the new release of Chrome that's more than double the speed of our first launch a year ago and we also launched Chrome Frame, which is an open-source plug in for IE that dramatically speeds up Java script that invoke it. So speed matters and we're going to keep investing in big projects that make the Web faster.
So you're probably getting restless by now so I'll take it back to the questions.
Patrick Pichette
So we will turn it over to Maria and the operator to go through the questions that we have online.
Question-and-Answer Session
Maria Shim
We'll take the first question from Mark May – Needham & Company.
Mark May – Needham & Company
What are your goals with the recently relaunched Double Click ad exchange and do you think this offering could be a material contributor to Google's overall business revenue over the next one to three years?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I can start and maybe Nikesh can help me. We think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we are making great progress with fixing the whole fractured and very complex ad ecosystem. What we still need to do is we've got to make it much easier for the advertisers to run their display campaigns across a much broader range of Web sites. We have got to create demand for the publishers ad inventory, much of which I mentioned on the call goes unsold. We have got to open up this whole ecosystem and really the goal is to grow the pie for all the players. 
So as we get better tools for the publishers to improve the forecasting and extract the value of the available inventory that they have, and as we make it easier for the advertisers to plan and better target their desired audiences, we think we will make significant progress.
Maybe I'll let Nikesh talk about the customer responses and the revenue opportunities.
Nikesh Arora
I think you said most of what we wanted to say, but as I mentioned, over half of the largest 25 ad networks in the U.S. are already using the new ad exchange, which is a good thing. In addition to which we are seeing a lot of interest from other networks in the market so I think the ad exchange is an important element of the display ecosystem and exchanges are going to be relevant going forward.
Maria Shim
The next question comes from Imran Khan - JP Morgan.
Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Can you please help us understand what drove 6% decline in Cost-Per-Click? I am trying to better understand the impact of FX versus mix shift versus the impact of the economy.
Patrick Pichette
So we don't provide all of the details but it's very clear that the FX had an impact on these numbers. There are two things that we have to take into consideration. Take a step back, paid clicks continued to be quite healthy with 14% and 4%, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, so we're very pleased about that.
On the CPC growth, if you go back year-over-year, so relative to Q3 2008, the Euro actually had an 8% difference, the pound a 15% difference, and the Canadian dollar, to take another one, also closed at 8% difference. These numbers are material. They will drive quite a bit of impact in the financials. So if you reverse engineer all these numbers, that will give you a good sense of it. 
Second is, don't forget that we have quite a good healthy growth in international markets, which are, in many cases, lower CPC but they add dollars. So we're not worried about lower CPCs and when you get dollars and more performance. So this would be at the highest level.
Jonathan, any additional comments on the issue?
Jonathan Rosenberg
No, I think Patrick nailed the primary issue in FX. I think the second issue—we've talked about this on previous calls—it's that more of the clicks are coming from countries with lower CPCs. So we always want to caution you about not reading aggregate CPC metrics as a direct reflection of price changes.
Maria Shim
We received two questions on acquisitions from Brian Pitz – UBS and Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford C. Bernstein. 
Brian Pitz – UBS
Jeffrey Lindsay – Sanford C. Bernstein.
As to Eric's comments on Google looking to acquire again, whether there was some sense of strategic holes in the business and if we are going to be doing a large, transformative acquisition or will our policy still be to make small technology oriented type acquisitions.
Eric Schmidt
The way we think about acquisitions is we have historically done an acquisition, perhaps one a month or so. And those are typically small and they are typically complete an offering, they are typically technology intensive, they're not very expensive in the scheme of things and they bring some specific technology.
So in search there are a number of companies that we've looked at. Again, small companies that have invented some very interesting way of doing, for example, a kind of vertical search or a kind of analysis of how search should perform. 
In the area of advertising we've looked at, for example, in the display category there a number of small companies that have figured out better ways of sorting and working on display ads.
As we build out our enterprise business, there are obviously small companies that, again, have pieces of the offering. In the area of, for example Chrome and Chrome OS, there are parts of that platform that are most efficiently built by adding features that are already being done by small companies.
Obviously in Android similarly and so forth.
So there is no particular rhyme or reason or prioritization aside from the 70-20-10, that I already talked about. It's very much a function of the specific individuals.
We are certainly looking for larger businesses to buy but in those cases it would have to be some significant strategic rational. Some accelerant that it would provide for revenue, some major, major user base that we did not currently have access to. And so they are going to be quite infrequent.
So if you think about it, our two largest have been Double Click and YouTube, both of which look as though they are going to be incredibly successful, but the integration costs, the acquisition cost itself, was quite significant. 
So those would be relatively rate and if I were to estimate the frequency, it's hard to say. But it's certainly not monthly. Maybe every year or two. But certainly not every month.
Maria Shim
The next question comes from James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Have recent Gmail outages resulted from rapid user growth, under-investment in server capacity, or other factors?
Jonathan Rosenberg
It's a little unclear what outage you are referring to. There was a high-profile outage I believe on September 1 to the Web interface and it lasted about 100 minutes. And clearly that's a very big deal to us. We understand how much users depend on Gmail and we certainly learned a lot from it and we have taken steps to make sure that it doesn't happen again.
We are also very focused on improving recovery time if an outage does occur. That information is posted on the blog and I think the blog response that we posted actually covers in detail what happened. Generally it related to under-estimating the head room, from a machine perspective, during some routine maintenance that we did that led to a cascading failure. But it wasn't a function of under-investment in server capacity or anything like that.
Maria Shim
The next question is on capex from Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners.
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
Capex is down 70% year-to-date. Help us understand what was going on before and what is going on now. Previously were you overspending during the search cold war? Are you under-spending now?
Patrick Pichette
I will take this question and I'll make it a reference to the previous question. Let me make an overall note that you will remember in the previous quarter I had warned everybody that if you just kind of take a ruler and go down, we would hit kind of zero capex sometime in mid-September. And obviously that has not happened. We're investing. And we're investing heavily. It just happens that capex is lumpy. 
In referring back to the Gmail, we have all the capacity we need for all of the infrastructure. We pre-fund. We have capacity ahead of what we think our needs are going to be. We have been very fortunate in the last few quarters. 
A combination of very performance assets and really good utilization, as well as in a few cases, like I've talked about Scandinavia, a few delays created these timing issues, but clearly we are focused on investment.
Maybe Eric, you can turn it back—we talked about investment at the front end of the call—and make the bridge with it.
Eric Schmidt
I would like us to be spending more in this area because I think that the opportunity that it creates, that capital spending creates a very significant platform for future products, future growth. Part of the reason that you've seen over the last year or two, a decrease in capital has been we've been able to do some very, very significant efficiency improvements that are basically software. 
The hardware that we had deployed was not as highly utilized, technically not as busy. So we were able to increase that. And that goes right to the bottom-line in terms of capital spending. And that was a big project in engineering.
We've also benefited from the Moore's Law-related efficiency improvements with the multi-core architectures. And what's happening, of course, is that the chips are now going four-core, eight-core and that, of course, all of a sudden means that we need fewer CPUs to get the same level of performance.
And most of that is related to the data center, data operations, and so forth. And so it's highly dependent upon how many of that we need to deploy.
So it was more a transition from one architecture to another and efficiency improvements than a change in strategic direction.
Maria Shim
The next question comes from Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets.
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets
Are you seeing higher overall conversion rates currently versus in the first half of the year and can you quantify the improvement?
Nikesh Arora
Ross, we don't comment on precise metrics and conversion rates. I think the best way to think about it is to think about both from a consumer perspective and an advertiser perspective. In light of the continuing economic situation and still high unemployment, consumers appear to be acting rationally. If you look at it, when the price is right they go out and buy. So getting cash for clunkers or taking advantage of real estate incentives, but if necessary, they will buy. When you look at back-to-school purchases, they followed their normal quarterly pattern.
So I think that on the consumer side, we are seeing rational behavior. And on the advertiser side, as I mentioned earlier, the big advertisers are ramping up again, while smaller advertisers have been slower to jump back in. They were slower to leave.
So from an overall perspective, we believe conversion rates are holding up.
Maria Shim
The next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart.
Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart
Can you give us an update on Android adoption versus other smart phone choices? Also, how is the work on Google Chrome and it's going?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I can start with that. Eric mentioned on the prepared remarks probably the most obvious thing is just look at the scope of growth with devices, partners, carriers. You know, one device, one carrier, one country to twelve devices, twenty-six countries, thirty-two carriers in less than a year. The market is also very robust with over 10,000 applications available, which is something that we focus on very carefully. So basically the strategy of delivering a modern, open-source OS and enabling an ecosystem of developers and carriers seems to be paying off and the strategy is working.
Chrome OS is going very well. We think we're going to deliver on the goals of basically speed, simplicity and security so that computers just work and start up in a matter of seconds. And I think we will probably have more updates on that later in the year.
Eric Schmidt
Let me just add. Android adoption is literally about to explode. You have all the necessary conditions. You have the vendors, you have the distribution, and so forth. And this of course is a very critical period with all of everything being delivered and new announcements as well.
From the standpoint of Chrome OS, the internal demos that we've seen indicate that it is a materially significant achievement in platform computing. It is quite different from the current incumbents in a whole bunch of ways. Speed, efficiency, and so forth. It's not quite done and we hope to get a version out later this year for people to start developing. As you know, it's an open-source initiative so we appear to be roughly on time with the announcements we made a few months about Chrome OS and obviously the anticipation just increases.
Maria Shim
We will take the next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford C. Bernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford C. Bernstein
What are the plans for Google's large cash balances? Are stock buybacks being considered at any point?
Eric Schmidt
Patrick and I were talking about who should answer this question. We have been doing very well in the cash generation front, throughout this whole year, which is a critical year. We have been able to be very strongly cash flow positive and we hope that that will continue for a long time. We love cash.
The issue with stock buybacks is historically they have often not achieved the objective that they've set out. So they are certainly none under consideration right now and I wouldn't expect any time soon. I wouldn't rule one out but I would not put it on your list of things to anticipate any time soon.
From our perspective the cash gives us a lot of operating and strategic flexibility over the very long term and so we are very happy to have it sit in our bank account and earn modest interest rates.
Maria Shim
The next question comes from Justin Post – BAS-ML.
Justin Post – BAS-ML
What verticals, i.e. autos, travel, finance, ecommerce, has most year-over-year spending improvement in Q3 versus Q2?
Nikesh Arora
If you look at our verticals across the board, auto is by far the most well-performing vertical in the U.S. for the third quarter. This is primarily due to the government's Cash for Clunkers program. If you look beyond the clunkers program, the U.S. auto vertical is still poised for growth because of the age of the U.S. fleet and auto dollars continue to sort of shift online. The U.K. also has occurred well on a year-over-year basis as far as auto is concerned.
On travel we have seen trades a bit later than usual, sort of illustrating consumer caution. Retail, we are seeing sort of a back-to-school effect that's doing well. And finance continues to be a tough vertical, given the comps from last year are tough because last year we were just beginning to get into the financial crisis, we were seeing lots of queries and all those haven't come back as well this year, as you would expect or want them to. 
But having said that, there are pockets in finance which are still robust, like health insurance, or sort of insurance overall, which is primarily as a vertical.
Maria Shim
Next we have two questions on YouTube.
The first question is from Mark Mahaney – Citigroup.
Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
What is the update on this path's profitability?
And the second question is from Benjamin Schachter - Broadpoint Am Tech.
Benjamin Schachter - Broadpoint Am Tech
Can you quantify use of revenues in any way? Under what circumstances might you break out YouTube and video-related revenues for us in the future?
Patrick Pichette
I will answer the front end of this question and then turn it over to Nikesh for more color commentary.
In general, as Nikesh talked about at the front end, we are really pleased about YouTube's performance. It is going very well. It is completely in line with what we discussed at the last quarter's results, which is YouTube is on its path to profitability in the not-too-distant future. 
I will let Nikesh talk about all of the great partnerships that are so critical to the success, and we are having a terrific quarter on this, but just to give you one sound bite, we are monetizing more than a billion video views every week on YouTube. So if you think of that, it just gives you a sense of perspective of the success that's going on. But I'll let Nikesh give you more detail on it.
Nikesh Arora
If you look at YouTube, we have primarily been able to sell pretty much home page ads across the world on YouTube, to the extent that 90% of our U.S. home page video YouTube inventory was sold out in the third quarter, which is a tremendous improvement from prior quarters. And we continue to drive forward on this ad format around the world.
As I mentioned also, we are beginning to unleash the freehold inventory which is on YouTube, making it available for our sales forces to go out and sell. So I think there are various monetization opportunities as it relates to YouTube from the ad format side.
On the inventory side, as I said, we have been able to close deals with pretty much everybody in the music label business, as I mentioned. In addition to which we also announced Channel 4 this morning, so we are creating more and more inventory so that we can create more inventory for our sales forces to go out and sell these new ad formats for.
So like Patrick, I am very pleased with our ability to monetize YouTube so far and we like the trend.
Maria Shim
We will take the next question from Jason Helfstein – Oppenheimer & Co.
Jason Helfstein – Oppenheimer & Co.
Do you think the company can execute on its long-term growth initiatives and still keep margins flat, or should we assume the company sacrifices some margin growth to protect its dominant position and to create new growth areas?
Patrick Pichette
I don't like the word dominant. I think we have great products and because we have great products and great technologies we are winning in the market. I suggest Eric also comment on it. But we are looking at each product that we are shipping to be a successful product. And if there is an investment phase for some of these products, then there is just a simple investment phase. And we are not managing the business for a percent margin at all. We are managing the business for successful products that contribute over time.
Eric Schmidt
That's an interesting question, because as you know, margins have actually gone the other way from the questioner's implication and we have been able to build a great business. We do not look at margins on a percentage basis at all and we also are happy to have businesses that have differential margins as long as they are successful and provide strategic value. 
So one way to think about is we do not have a margin target, we have a revenue growth target and an expense target and a net cash flow target, and they add up to whatever the outcome margin is. So we do not manage along those lines.
From our perspective, the mission of the company is to go out there and serve and also in the context, build businesses that are growing and are profitable. And we will accept whatever their native margin structures are and if the margins improve that's great and if they get worse that's okay, too, as long as we're winning in the marketplace.

Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets
International revenues [inaudible] increased 19% year-over-year in Q3, an acceleration from 17% in Q2 if my math is correct. Can you provide some color on which regions are driving the acceleration?
Nikesh Arora
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are seeing strength across various markets around the world. As far as it relates to the Americas, Brazil has been a strong performer. We didn't see much of a slowdown in our Asia Pacific and Japan regions and therefore China has done well and other parts of Asia Pacific.
We continue to see strength in Northern Europe. France and Germany have been stable. As far as Southern Europe is concerned, Spain is seeing a revival. And we see most of these markets continue to grow well for us.

Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital.
Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital
How do you define investing heavily in the future? More in infrastructure, products, headcounts? How will you determine how to complete a ramp spending back up?
Eric Schmidt
Doug's question basically says how do you judge between the various things you should invest in, and the answer is, it depends. You use your business judgment. We know when we've got a successful product. We can tell because we measure it. And if we can see it growing, we invest to accelerate it.
We also tend to starve the projects which are not growing and try to figure out what error we made. So it's pretty straight-forward business judgment.
From our perspective, I would like us to see increasing our capital expenditures to the degree that we get competitive advantage from there. I've already indicated investment in headcount. The investment in headcount is, roughly speaking, half engineering and half non-engineering, which has been historically our model. The engineering is, for all the reasons that you can imagine. We are short key technical talent to achieve some of these broader initiatives. And the non-engineering is mostly in sales and that's frankly, quota-bearing sales people who bring in money and income in the quarter.
And on the product side, the products are really driven by the product strategy that we've talked about. And those are largely controlled by a set of operating units where they have product heads within the company who pretty much make those decisions under the supervision of Larry and Sergey.
Maria Shim
The next question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank Securities
The underlying margin profile of the page search business is in the 58+% range. On a contribution margin basis do your display advertising initiatives carry comparable margins? Can you speak to the margin profile of the display ad business?
Patrick Pichette
We just don't comment on specific product margins. So thanks for your questions, but typically we just don't comment on any of those.
Maria Shim
The next question comes from Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners.
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
You recently removed tele outlets from your mapping product in the U.S. How mission-critical is the underlying mapping data with regard to your mobile ad strategy? What other areas of your business can help you with?
Jonathan Rosenberg
We launched the new maps data set and we're now using it in the U.S. and Mexico and we have basically built this through a wide range of sources. It includes street view, overhead imagery, the census bureau, the forest service, and what is so key here is it gives us lots more flexibility to create new types of maps. 
So for example, somebody or walking or biking or tourists versus locals will want to use very different types of maps. And it also leaves us much more open to users editing through mapmaker and other feedback mechanisms.
So this is very, very significant and will allow us to launch better place pages and just make the whole process of looking at local information much better. If you think about it, behind the movie theater is a valid address in some countries, but the only way you can capture that on a map is with local knowledge, and this is going to allow us to harvest that all over the world.
Maria Shim
The next question is from Benjamin Schachter - Broadpoint Am Tech.
Benjamin Schachter - Broadpoint Am Tech
International revenues, any change to order of countries that are the most meaningful contributors to revenues? I'm trying to get a sense of where Japan and the emerging economies rank relative to the big European countries. Are Brazil or China significant yet?
Nikesh Arora
Whilst we don't give out the relative rankings or the revenues of countries outside of the U.S. and the U.K. I think the best way to think about this is, as we mentioned, 53% of our revenues come from outside the U.S. and as someone earlier on the call has already done the math, that that part of our revenue continues to grow at a good pace. I did call out certain countries, so in that we have countries that grow fast, which grow very fast. And I called out certain countries which are growing very fast for us. 
I think that should give you a sense of scale in terms of which parts of our business, which parts of the international market are doing very well relative to the others and over time all of the markets are relative and significant for us.
Maria Shim
The next question comes from Brian Pitz – UBS.
Brian Pitz – UBS
Would you talk about adoption of the Double Click ad exchange by ad networks and what kind of impact? Has there been any discernable impact of pricing on the content network?
Patrick Pichette
I think given the exchange this quarter, there is not enough data for us to be able to look at and be able to say these things with certainty. But if you think about all the ad exchanges already has done for us, it is already beginning to take away some pricing and efficiency from the market, because effectively you are able to collect inventory from various networks, which is unsold, which we believe is roughly about 25% of inventory in aggregate, ends up being unsold because it doesn't have a common exchange or a common place to get traded. So that's what the ad exchange actually begins to enable. 
And that is the reason you are seeing many, many large networks wanting to participate in such an ad network, because they want the inventory to be sold at the best price possible. So effectively, as we can get more and more sellers to these exchanges, we have more inventory in the exchange. You will begin to see stability in price, which also allows us to create some consistency in our ability to target the ads towards the right users.
So I think overall it's going to be positive for the overall display market. It is too early to tell precisely what the impact is based on our launch this quarter.
Maria Shim
The next question is from Mark Mahaney – Citigroup.
Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
Can you provide any commentary on how material mobile searches have been to your overall search growth, or when they could become material on a global basis? Also, what color can you provide on these searches in terms of monetization potential?
Patrick Pichette
Just to give a sense that, again, we don't give the detail numbers. What we provided this quarter, which I think was a really, really statistic, is on a quarter-over-quarter basis mobile searches grew 30% on Google this last quarter.
It tells you something about the mobile space, the space of the smart phones and how they are really transformative. So the combination of the Android platform with all the smart phones and the momentum in there, as well as the iPhone and the rest of them, I mean, they're just basically transforming how people live on a mobile basis. And if you run the tape forward, I think again, another support for the Android strategy, if you have—if we move forward the adoption of these smart phones by having a lower cost infrastructure because it's open-source and you bring that, instead of taking seven years—I'm just kind of giving an illustration—all this happens in four years. Think of all the searches that will happen so much faster. 
So the ecosystem is incredibly vibrant right now and truly what's interesting about these phones is there are a lot of new types of searches because you are location-specific, you are activity-specific, you are local-specific. Just a new set of areas that are to create a new set of monetization opportunities. 
So it is for all these reasons that we are so bullish about it and just really investing heavily.
So that's my best answer I can give you without any specifics.
Maria Shim
The next question comes from Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse
You indicated that you are prepared to invest heavily again. Can expense ratios remain stable in that context or will expenses as a percent of revenues begin to increase?
Patrick Pichette
Let me give you the context of why we are making the comment this quarter about investment.
I think the best way to characterize our situation is the following. Google really has been and continues to be an unconventional company that runs on its innovation agenda. I think it's fair to say that in the last 12 months—you will remember, 12 months ago we were sitting together and there was a massive crisis going on in the banking system and the economy—and this was the worst recession in like generations, if not 100 years. We decided at that time to just be prudent about navigating these unchartered territories.
As Eric said a few minutes ago, now it's clear that the banking system is not collapsing and the economy, even though many sectors are going to continue to hurt, the worst is behind us. It is in that context that I think it's important that now we go back to do what we really do well. Innovate, invest, build the future.
And that is what is really meant. And then I think that, as Eric mentioned a few minutes ago, we are really optimistic about making these investments and we are looking forward to it and that ties to both hiring and more capex and we will judge them on a case-by-case basis.
I think that is the best way to understand what's going on, really, in the company.
Maria Shim
The next question comes from Jason Helfstein – Oppenheimer & Co.
Jason Helfstein – Oppenheimer & Co.
Give us some color on U.S. versus international paid click trends and CPCs in the quarter.
Jonathan Rosenberg
We really don't typically comment on the specifics there. We certainly saw click growth across lots of regions and CPC growth, but the main thing you have to be looking at there is the blend. It is largely impacted by the growing regions, like China, Brazil, and India where the CPCs are relatively lower.
Maria Shim
Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital.
Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital
Do you think your growth going forward comes more from pay click volume or pricing increases?
Nikesh Arora
I think this relates to the previous question with Jonathan. I think the best way to think about this is there are still a lot of countries, a lot of parts of the world, where we are still seeing more and more people come online, which creates more searches, and therefore creates more paid click volume around the world.
At the same time a lot of our ads innovation which we are doing is going to drive some of the CPC growth in some far more mature markets.
Maria Shim
Your next question comes from James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
CPC has improved by 5% sequentially two quarters in a row with benefits from FX hedging. Does Google believe that CPC has already enjoyed most of the recovery rebound or is CPC still a sub-trend?
Patrick Pichette
We don't comment forward, so we were really pleased with, as Nikesh said, in a way our revenue really reflects what's going on in the economy from the consumer side and from the advertisers' side and it's a great question as to what the coming quarters are going to look like. 
To give a better color commentary on this, what's really interesting about Q4 this year is if you think about everything that happened last year, year-over-year comparisons are going to be really interesting. So, for example, last year there was a flood of inventory that needed to find a home so discounting was quite dramatic. And coupons were everywhere. This year it's a different story with inventory at an all-time low and people prudent. It will be interesting to see. 
So rather than to give you any kind of answers as to how we see the future, I think it's really important that people have a mental model of how they think the economy is going to rebound and everybody has their own view, but we don't comment on perspective.
Maria Shim
Your next question comes from Jim Friedland – Cowen & Company.
Jim Friedland – Cowen & Company
The Google sites tax rate was down quarter-over-quarter, 6% to 5.8% for the first time. Are you pulling out of some site traffic acquisition deals? Are you renegotiating contracts? Has the sites tax rate finally stabilized?
Patrick Pichette
Every deal is done on a deal basis and they are all profitable. We look for a great partnership. We are not pulling out of any great deals. We just work with each of our partners. We are delighted to have so many partners. And every deal that makes sense we actually do together. Sometimes you have deals that either expired or didn't have the right mix so you may have fluctuations like you had this quarter but I wouldn't read too much into it.
Maria Shim
We are going to take one more question and that's from George Askew - Stifle Nicolaus.
George Askew - Stifle Nicolaus
How rapidly do you expect headcount to grow over the next two years?
Patrick Pichette
I'm going to steal thunder from two conversations Eric and I have, and it's been about if you think about everything we've looked through together over the last year, it would have been great to continue to hire even sooner. So in that sense we are delighted that we are able to now continue to fund for investing in our headcount resources and then you still have to kind of make sure that—you know, it's not about headcount, it's about finding the people that fit in the Google culture, the best engineers, the best minds and as we find them we hire them. So it's more a function of finding these fits rather than to put quotas on a quarterly basis. And that's why this quarter we had a bit of a retreat—just a 100 kind of so at Google—but it's not because we were trying to shrink, it's just you have to find the right Googler.
Eric Schmidt
In terms of recruiting, I think we do it well, so we will grow it whatever way we can.
Maria Shim
That wraps up the Q&A portion. Again, we are trying something new this quarter so we would love to get your feedback. And now I'm going to turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Schmidt
Just to finish up, I hope it's clear that we're very happy with the quarter. We believe we now have the confidence in our underlying business and the business trends to begin to get back, to do the kinds of things that we do so well and that we really see as our mission, which is to make the world an information-rich place, to build some of these new businesses, and really serve our customers very well.
So with that, thank you all very much.

Good day and welcome, everyone, to the Google Inc. conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Maria Shim. Please go ahead, Madam. 
Maria Shim 
Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to today’s second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With us are Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer;  Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of Product Management; and joining us for the first time, Nikesh Arora, President of Global Sales Operations and Business Development. Eric, Patrick, and Jonathan will provide us with their thoughts on the quarter and then Nikesh will join us for Q&A. 
This call is being webcast from our investor relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our website for important information, including our earnings press release, issued a few minutes ago, along with slides that accompany today’s prepared remarks. 
A replay of this call will also be available on our website in a few hours. 
Please note that we routinely post important information on our investor relations website, located at investor.google.com, and we encourage you to make use of that resource. 
As a reminder, we are holding two calls today. On this call we will discuss our strategic overview and Q&A with the usual format, followed by a second call which is effectively an extended Q&A session with Jonathan and Patrick, giving the opportunity for participants to ask more detailed financial and product questions in an efficient and reg FD compliant manner. 
The second call will begin at 3:00 P.M. Pacific Time and will also be webcast from our investor relations website. 
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor -- some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding investments in our core business and innovation, expected performance of our business, and our expected level of capital expenditures. 
These statements involved a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. 
Please refer to our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, as well as our earnings press release for a more detailed discussion of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies may be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the investor relations section of our website.  
Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on the call, such as operating profit and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. 
We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. 
Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick. 
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Maria. Good afternoon or good evening, everybody. What we will do is we will have our regular schedule, so Eric will give us his comments first. I’ll cover the financial portion and then Jonathan will give us a product update. As Maria mentioned, we also have Nikesh with us and then we will turn it to Q&A. So without further ado, I’ll let Eric introduce. 
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
Thank you very much, Patrick. So Google, we’ve had a good quarter, one that demonstrates our resilience in what continues to be a very difficult environment, 3%  year over year growth, as you have seen from the press release. 
Google as a business appears to have stabilized despite the still weak economic environment. Advertisers and customers are obviously seeing the benefit of the performance-based advertising that we offer and consumers are clearly using search more and ever to find the best deals. 
We’ve also implemented careful cost controls to help our performance. Making our business more efficient has been our goal for the last few quarters and it should put us in a good position to benefit from the eventual recovery whenever that occurs. And we are going to continue to invest in innovation. History shows that companies which invest in innovation during downturns emerge stronger than the cost-cutting competitors and it’s easy for big companies, Google is now a large company, to become conservative to take small steps when they need to take really big ones, so we are determined not to make that mistake. 
And as an example, you don’t change the world incrementally. You do it through big innovation and the ability to execute on your ideas. So for example, we just announced Chrome OS for netbooks, our effort to rethink what an operating system should be, based on our lightning fast browser technology, Chrome, which people are already using. We need a faster operating system for the same reason we need faster browsers -- people are now doing everything on the web and this will be an operating system built around ubiquity and the power of the Internet. 
And innovation, of course, is not just new products like what we talked about last week. It’s also the key to long-term growth in our core and our new businesses. 
In our core business, search is still an unsolved problem, even though Google is working very, very hard on the next generation of search -- more social, more personal, more intelligent, we did more than a hundred search quality improvements in the second quarter and users are now coming to us with increasingly more complex questions and queries. 
We’re getting much better at finding the exact information and content people are looking for. We just introduced, for example, Google Square which automatically fetches and sorts facts and data from across the web on a given topic. We now actually have another feature called Search Options, which Jonathan is going to talk about. 
In ads, strides in ads quality and sales drove healthy revenue growth despite a tough economic environment. Our ads keep getting better as we’ve developed new ways of identifying high quality and relevant ads. We’re experimenting with innovative ad formats for search, particularly in the areas of local, products, and video, which should help us a lot in some of these new businesses. 
And on the sales side, we’ve been much, much more rigorous in terms of our management, in terms of our measurement in focusing our resources in the highest potential areas. For example, advertiser acquisition and better tools to identify the largest opportunity for individual customers. Of course, Nikesh has been driving that. 
And in our new businesses, it’s also a good story -- display in particular, including YouTube, performed very well this quarter. YouTube is now on a trajectory that we are very pleased with and we are helping marketers and agencies create great ads easily. For example, the Double-Click Studio, tools which allow customers to build end-to-end rich ad campaigns. 
In mobile and android, another area of innovation in new businesses, mobile devices are becoming an extension of the Internet. We all know this. And more and more Google searches are coming from mobile phones of all kinds. So we are focusing to innovate in this space. So for example, we’ve done great news with Android, with somewhere between 18 and 20 Android powered phones on the market by the end of the year, which is phenomenal. 
Even in the enterprise, we’ve been able to have significant Q2 deals. The mobile handset division of Motorola has moved all 15,000 users to Google. Seventy-five new schools for apps education in the second quarter. Temple University, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, University of Alabama, the list goes on. And we’ve now deployed against, for example, 30,000 employees at [Voleyo], which is an automotive company,  Johnson Diversity, a cleaning product manufacturer, another 10,000 employees. So the model is beginning to work. 
To put this in perspective, we are very pleased with our year-over-year performance, particularly in light of the still weak economy and the economic situation continues to be tough, as we all know. We saw relative stability in our business in the second quarter. It’s too early for us to tell when the recovery will materialize. I wish we could just prove it, you know, we could do the analysis and figure it out but we don’t know how to do that yet. So when the recovery does come, and it always eventually comes, we are very well-positioned for the future, given our constant and continuing investment in innovation. 
So with that, Patrick, thank you very much. Go ahead. 
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. So I’ll take a few minutes to run through our results. 
We are pleased of our performance in Q2, showing solid revenue growth and good expense management, especially in the kind of environment that Eric portrayed. Our gross revenue grew 3% year over year to $5.5 billion. We saw relative strength across our business, despite a weak macroeconomic environment and a dollar that is still quite strong compared to last year. In fact, if we applied last year’s exchange rates to our Q2 revenue, these would have been roughly $500 million higher. So fortunately, we have recognized $124 million of benefits from our hedging program to partially compensate. 
Google.com was also strong, contributing the majority of the total year-over-year growth. It was up 3.5% year over year to $3.7 billion, with continued healthy traffic growth and we saw signs of strength in certain consumer verticals, such as shopping and computer and electronics. Others, such as finance, continued to be relatively weak. 
In Q2, we also benefited from a number of ads quality launches. Ad sense was up 2% year over year to $1.7 billion. In Ad sense for content in particular, we saw solid results, our smaller partners performed well and our display business experienced strong year-over-year growth as well, and I’ll let Jonathan and Nikesh talk about more about these successes. 
Our global aggregate paid click growth remained healthy. They were up 15% year over year, even if down 2% quarter over quarter for seasonality. Aggregate cost per click growth was down 13% year over year but up 5% quarter over quarter. Again, FX clearly had a negative impact on our year-over-year growth but a positive impact quarter over quarter due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the first quarter. 
Turning to our geographic performance, the U.S. had revenues up 2% year over year to $2.6 billion. International revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue, or $2.9 billion. The U.K. was down 8% year over year to $715 million, and was clearly negatively impacted by the FX, as well as ongoing macroeconomic weakness. This is partially offset by revenues from our hedging program. 
Let me now turn to expenses -- traffic acquisition costs were $1.5 billion, or 27% of total advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $655 million, which included $14 million in stock-based compensation. And all other operating expenses totaled $1.5 billion, including approximately $279 million in stock-based compensation again. 
On a year-over-year basis, our OpEx was lower by nearly $120 million and flat quarter over quarter. So as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes the stock-based compensation, increased to $2.2 billion in Q2, compared to $1.9 billion last year and our resulting non-GAAP operating margin of 39.2%. 
We are really pleased that we’ve been able to manage our costs prudently while fully funding our strategic growth areas in search, display, mobile, and apps. Again, Jonathan is going to go into more details of our initiatives in these areas in a minute. 
Turning to headcount, we had approximately 20,000 full-time employees at the end of Q2, down approximately 375 from the end of Q1. Even though we continue to hire in many areas of our business in Q2, we ended up with a decrease primarily related to the reduction in the sales and marketing positions we had announced you’ll remember at the end of Q1. 
Let me now turn to cash management -- in other income and expense, we had a net expense of $18 million for the quarter. As I talked to many of you on the last call, we manage our cash very responsibly. For the past year, and again for most of Q2, we’ve been focused on capital preservation and we believe that this was obviously the right thing to do, given the recent macroeconomic environment. So in consequence, this means we realized lower yields on our investments. 
Our realized gains on our marketable securities were $18 million and once again this quarter, the high volatility relative to the options strike prices required us to accelerate our hedging expenses, as per the FAS-133 rules. The impact on OI&E on our FX program was roughly equivalent from last quarter. 
So as I mentioned earlier, we did however continue to recognize benefits from this hedging program while we also benefited from a slightly weaker U.S. dollar during Q2 versus Q1. 
Our cash flow hedging program allowed us to recognize a benefit of approximately $124 million to international revenue this quarter. 
Our effective tax rate was 20% for Q2. Let me remind you that any change to the mix of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries, as well as the effect on earnings of various hedging activities and the related hedged items, do have an effect on our tax rate. 
Operating cash flow was very strong at $1.6 billion. CapEx for Q2 was $139 million. While the recent trend in CapEx has no doubt been declining, remember that we will continue to make investments, and significant ones in CapEx in that it is simply lumpy from quarter to quarter, depending on the timing on when we are able to make these investments. 
Finally, free cash flow was also strong at $1.5 billion. 
So in summary, we are pleased with our Q2 results, especially despite the expected seasonality, the economic situation, and our year-over-year FX fluctuations. It’s clear we are able to be disciplined about our costs but while staying really focused on fully investing on the big, long-term opportunities that we see in our core business, display, mobile, and apps. 
Finally, and also important to note, I would just like to remind everyone, as we do every year, that Q3 also tends to be impacted by summer seasonality. 
With that, I would like to thank you for your time and I’ll turn it over to Jonathan for his thoughts on the quarter. Jonathan. 
Jonathan J. Rosenberg
Okay, thanks, Patrick. So I want to highlight the key launches this quarter and try to give them context with some of the principles that drive our innovation efforts. If you’ll recall, going back to the founders letter from our IPO in 2004, we’ve always said our focus is on users. Today, user interest still drives pretty much everything we do but recently, we’ve become a lot more focused on what we call the active power users. 
What we’ve seen is that power users in search are getting a lot more sophisticated, so they are running more complex queries. They end up typing in longer queries than they used to and their expectations today are much, much higher. If you actually think about search, five years ago people were just delighted when they googled what they wanted and they found it but today, they actually get upset when they don’t get what they want. So that’s a really big difference. 
So to better server power users, we launched our new search options feature, and what that does is it lets you slice and dice search results in different ways, like by time or type of result. If you click on the show options link, which you’ll find at the top of a search result, you’ll get a sense of just how that innovation drives usage. 
We also have a basic user principle that fast is better than slow and we’ve told you this before and that it’s critical for search and our engineers continue to focus on reducing search latency throughout the world but speed is actually also key for all of our other products. 
We launched a number of improvements with Picasa in Q2 and one of them lets you run a slide show of the pictures that you’ve uploaded to the web, and it does it as quickly as if the pictures were stored on your computer. You can see this if you go to a large online album and you just rapidly bang on the right arrow key. That’s basically what I did when the team told me they were ready to launch. So try it -- it’s cathartic to hit your keyboard. Just go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang on the arrow key and you’ll watch on the screen and you’ll really see viscerally that apps running in the cloud can actually be as rich and as powerful as apps on your desktop. 
We also have a policy of ship fast and iterate often, so we redesigned Google Labs and our engineers have been releasing new labs features about twice per month. Fusion tables, Google Squared, similar images are a few from Q2. 
Gmail is also another example where we are shipping and iterating. We are pushing out roughly one new feature a week -- things like automatic message translation and my team gave me a long list of other features to list, but let me just repeat -- automatic message translation. Stop, think, and try that. It’s actually a pretty big deal. Also, our entire suite of apps products is robust enough that we took it out of beta last week. 
We also run product development by encouraging teams to make big product bets on key technical insights. We believe that our most innovative products historically, if you consider say search, maps, Gmail, news and Chrome, all of them are based on technical breakthroughs, or BETS. Recently we’ve become bullish on a new emerging standard called HTML 5 and it’s helping to make the web the platform for very powerful and rich applications. It’s especially important in mobile where the high-end phones with very rich browsers are becoming the norm. 
And this quarter, we launched mobile versions of Gmail and mobile web maps that run in the browser using HTML 5. Their performance really is remarkable. 
We believe that the runway to innovate due to the power of computers on these mobile devices is nearly unbounded at the moment. We are also making another technical bet with Google Chrome OS.  A whole new generation of web-based apps demand a much better, faster user experience and once you have all your stuff online, you ought to be able to just open up your computer and get there in a matter of seconds. 
We are also innovating and driving monetization with mobile and YouTube as well. Mobile monetization picked up a good bit of momentum as search traffic grew, again driven mostly by the smartphones. And we’re seeing that users on these high-end phones are very active and engaged beyond search, so display advertising on those phones is actually emerging as an interesting mechanism. 
On YouTube, monetized views have more than tripled in the past year. We’re now monetizing billions of views of partner videos every month and we are actively promoting featured partner videos on all the -- on the home, watch, and search pages. 
Of course, one of our most innovative areas is ads quality and we shipped more than a dozen improvements there this quarter. That’s kind of a typical pace that I usually share with you but in terms of our  PM impact, it was a pretty strong set with a higher impact than usual. 
Finally, we always want to make the web better. We believe that what’s good for the web is good for Google and email is obviously a web application that generates a lot of usage. So a while back, we asked the question, what if email were invented today? And as you know, the answer there was Wave, which is a totally new way to communicate and collaborate online. 
What we did there was rather than having our Gmail team work on this, the whole product was conceived and developed by a small team in Australia. They worked completely autonomously. They called the project Walkabout and the product received a standing ovation at our recent developer conference. 
Android, Chrome, Wave, and Chrome OS are all open source. This kind of open innovation helps us create the next generation of breakthroughs, and when I say us, I don’t mean Google, I mean the larger community of creative web developers. The more power and tools that we put in their hands, the more innovation we know we are going to see on the web and that benefits users around the world and we think makes the pie bigger for everyone. 
So with that, back to Patrick. 
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jonathan. So what we’ll do now is we’ll turn it over to the Operator and we’ll set up the call for Q&A. 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Imran Khan from J.P. Morgan. 
Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan
Two questions -- one on the mobile application side, I think you talked about that the mobile search volume has increased significantly. Could you help us understand the revenue per search difference on the mobile versus the web and do you think it will cannibalize your search on the desktop?
And secondly, with -- some could argue that Google [inaudible] its search market share through some of the distribution deal like Ask and AOL. Considering one of your competitors launched a new search technology, how worried are you that they could be potentially aggressive to win back some of those distribution deals and how aggressive you will be to make, hold back to those distribution deals?
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
Imran, thanks for your questions. On the mobile search side, one of the key things we’ve done in the last few months is we’ve started to show the desktop ads. It turns out that the separate mobile ads have their own formats. Typically there wasn’t enough demand, there weren’t enough kind of creatives and so forth. So we started showing the desktop ads on the mobile browsers of high quality and these of course include the iPhone and the Android phone and anything that’s a web-kit inspired browser. 
All of a sudden we started seeing a tremendous number of searches and also very good click through rates. So they monetize at a similar level, if they are desktop-based because of course they are in the same auction. 
It makes sense over time that those ads should perform better than on PCs because on a mobile device, we know more about the person and we could have an even more targeted ad but we don’t do that today. 
Jonathan J. Rosenberg
The other thing that I would say, you asked specifically about cannibalization -- I don’t think there really is a cannibalization dynamic. We see that mobile searches tend to complement desktop volume. Mobile goes up when people are away from their desk, so weekend tends to be higher for mobile traffic. And of course, the reverse is true for the desk top. 
On the second question, I think it’s kind of too early to tell from a market share perspective what’s going to play out in the long run. We certainly haven’t seen any large shift in share to date. 
Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan
Thank you. 
Patrick Pichette
We’ll go to the next question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Mark Mahaney. 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup 
Thank you. Also two questions -- Eric, you mentioned you think the business is stabilizing. What are one or the two most important things that you look at to make that call as to whether business is stabilizing or not?
And then for Patrick, there’s a lot of cost efficiencies that have been gained over the last couple of quarters. Can you talk to us about what the cost structure looks like coming out of the recession, whenever that is? To what extent should we believe that the cost efficiencies will stay in place post the recession? Or is this more temporary efficiencies? Thank you. 
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
On the stabilizing question,  a quarter ago, we had no idea where the bottom was. We started off the year and all of a sudden our metrics were off and it became clear that starting roughly Christmas, people were spending more time searching and when they purchased products, they were purchasing products of less value. Furthermore, when they did so, the whole process just took more time. 
It appears as though, although the RPMs have not fully recovered, the other aspects of behavior have in fact come back. And with the notable exception of the financial vertical, the other verticals in particular, shopping and travel, which had been significantly affected, appear to be recovering. 
So some of those tells us to say the word stabilizing. We’re not at the moment looking at that downward spiral that we thought we might see six months ago. 
On the second question, let’s ask Nikesh to offer some perspectives on how this is playing out. 
Nikesh Arora
Just to add to what Eric has already said, if you look at it from a geographical basis as well, we are seeing stabilizing in some of our key markets around the world. Also from an advertiser point of view, earlier in the year there seemed to be more uncertainty amongst advertisers who seem to now have come back and continue to go back and bid for major categories, major verticals. The small advertisers have stayed pretty much consistent throughout this process because they are very ROI focused. They understand the value of search, they understand what they are investing for. Large advertisers had sort of watched and wanted to watch and wait for a while have seem to have come back to the table and that’s where we are seeing the stabilization from the advertiser side as well. 
Patrick Pichette
So that covers the first question. Let me jump on the second one -- I think we can be really proud at Google about how googlers have managed responsibly in the last two, three, four quarters if you think of everything that the economy has thrown at us. We’ve managed to keep the right balance between the Google culture of being frugal but generous environment. That’s really what portrays the place and we didn’t lose our magic around that. 
And most of all, I think that we are managing the company to best position itself for the long-term growth. So it’s clear we are able to be disciplined about costs but at the same time, fully investing in our long-term opportunities. 
So I think that what we can take away from the last few quarters is we have that ability and we continue to manage it that way so we have the flexibility we need. 
We’ll go to the next question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Justin Post from BOA Merrill Lynch. 
Justin Post - BOA Merrill Lynch
Thank you. My question is on paid clicks and CPCs -- first on CPCs, it looks like if we back our currency at $44 million, they were up 4% quarter over quarter and is there any kind of sign of stabilization in that number or is that due to mix and seasonality? And the second thing is paid clicks, 15% growth -- could you talk a little bit about the mix? Are the higher value clicks in say the U.S. and U.K. growing slower than maybe some of the lower value clicks internationally? Could that be a long-term CPC pressure or are paid clicks growing pretty even across your entire system? Thank you. 
Jonathan J. Rosenberg
Just to comment on the clicks across the system, I think the growth is more seasonality and mix. One of the things that we see is that Brazil and China, for example, are pretty significant and probably have disproportionately more clicks. So I think we are seeing a mix of clicks from the high CPC Western European countries and U.S. being less relative to some of the growing markets. So that overall is having downward pressure on CPC. 
I think the bids tended to decline more earlier this year and are declining -- are no longer declining now as a general rule across the board. 
Justin Post - BOA Merrill Lynch
Thank you. 
Patrick Pichette
We’ll go to the next question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Christa Quarles from Thomas Weisel Partners.  
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
My question is on vertical search in the context of Twitter and its real-time search and even Bing’s attempt to carve out shopping, travel, local, et cetera. My question is one, how do you think about the concept of vertical search? Two, how strong do you believe your offerings currently are, and particularly how well you are merchandising those offerings to consumers? And three, do you still see big monetization improvements as you think about vertical search and improvements in [inaudible]?
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
Historically we’ve not used the term vertical search, because Google attempts to sort of answer the question without categorizing it as this category or that. Other people have said we are going to offer a special service around this or that. So we work very hard to sort of take the query without bias -- you know, this is the way it plays out. 
So with respect to vertical search headroom, there’s plenty of such headroom, especially as our ads products get better. And so the reason we mentioned, for example, that in travel, it could come back but finance had not because that does in fact affect the revenue. We understand that but we try not to sort of say there’s a travel site or what have you. Longer term, you never know what kind of innovation we can do to do that. It’s been observed, for example, that in some of these verticals, the ads are particularly more valuable than even some of the search results but we’ve not yet thought through what we will do with that observation. 
Jonathan J. Rosenberg
I think it is the case on the vertical side that there is a lot of opportunity to get incremental monetization gains where you can further qualify the leads better for the advertisers. So for example, the finance area and the travel area are areas where there’s a lot of opportunity to do that, so that you end up putting more information in the ad and then incrementally getting more information from the customer so that you can further qualify whether or not the customer in the finance area is interested in a particular type of mortgage, and then you send them to an advertiser with whom they are more likely to consummate a specific transaction that that advertiser is willing to pay for. So there’s a lot of opportunity there.
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
That’s helpful. Thank you. 
Patrick Pichette
We’ll go to the next question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Benjamin Schachter from Broadpoint Amtech.
Benjamin Schachter - Broadpoint Amtech
Years ago I recall Eric discussing the idea that advertisers should be thinking about the Google spend as COGS and not sales and marketing. I guess it was the notion that you give us a dollar, we’ll give you X dollars in sales. So now with more  video images and structured data appearing in the stirrup, I’m just wondering -- should we expect to begin to see new monetization methods beyond just the traditional text based CPC actually appearing within the sort of basic Google.com [search]? Thanks. 
Patrick Pichette
I’ll let Nikesh answer that. 
Nikesh Arora
In fact, we are beginning to see other forms of advertising and monetization. You already have CPM based monetization on our video properties. We have CPC based monetization on our display networks. We have even CPA based monetization on a certain part of our display networks, so you are beginning to see different forms of monetization come forth in the online arena. And as we go forward, as more and more media begins to shift towards online, we are going to see different forms of monetization. Most recently, we are beginning to see more and more branded advertising on YouTube and on various display properties. 
So yes, the trend is in that direction. 
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from James Mitchell from Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much for taking the question. I wanted to dig a little bit into why the general and admin spending was so well controlled. If memory serves, you had some [inaudible] legal costs this quarter last year and some severance costs in the first quarter of 2009 but I wondered if there were any abnormalities in the second quarter of 2009, and also if there’s any reclassification from G&A to research and development. 
Patrick Pichette
You are right that at the last quarter we talked about there were some kind of extraordinary items here and there that you will remember, legal settlements and restructuring sales and a few other items. But otherwise I think that what you see is the result of good, prudent focus on our general and admin and we are really happy with the trajectory and where we landed. But there’s nothing extraordinary, apart from what you just already mentioned. 
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Thank you. 
Patrick Pichette
We’ll take the next question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Sandeep Aggarwal from Collins Stewart.
Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart
Thanks for taking my question. Eric, can you give us some glimpses of how the world of computing will look like with the Chrome OS? And also maybe any comments on will it be a pre-installed deal with a PC OEM? Can it be downloaded? And if it can be downloaded, can it -- will it work with the existing installed base versus just a new PC shipment? Thank you. 
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
Thank you. What we talked about when we did the announcement a week ago was that we were going to build an open source version of Chrome OS and it will be available to the PC community a year from now. We are in fact talking to PC hardware manufacturers of both architectures, both ARM architecture as well as the Intel architecture, to design products that are very, very exciting that really fulfill the vision of cloud computing. 
Other aspects of our strategy are still to be worked out based on the feedback and so forth. There will be a reference hardware spec, appropriate features, and so forth and our primary focus for that product will be speed and in particular, speed of boot, speed of computation, and the seamless use of all the web services that are the promise of cloud computing. 
Will the software be generally available for download, will it run on existing hardware -- those are things to be worked out. 
Because it’s open source, we won’t have the kind of restrictions that other people have and it will be very possible for people to take it and do almost anything that they want to it, which is another one of the great benefits of the Chrome OS.
Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart
Thank you very much. 
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Youssef Squali from Jefferies & Company.
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Company
Thank you very much. Two quick questions for Jonathan -- by some accounts, June was reported to have been maybe soft or softer than April and May for online advertising. Was that true for Google as well and was there anything outside of just seasonality to account for that?
And then YouTube, you talked a little bit about it earlier and you said that you were monetizing billions of videos per month. The last time I heard you guys talk about it, you were talking about hundreds of millions of videos. So are we comparing apples-to-apples and I guess lastly, what are the most popular ad formats right now?
Jonathan J. Rosenberg
Sure. Let me start with the first question. We generally don’t parse intra-quarterly trends, so I really can’t say anything with respect to how June was or wasn’t different. The only anomalous factor in this quarter I think was really the general timing of Easter versus in the previous year it was I believe it was in Q1 and this year it was in Q2, but I don’t really have anything else that I could offer. 
I think what I said that was -- or what I meant to say was that monetizable views have tripled in the last year and that we are monetizing billions of views every month. Nikesh may be able to give you a sense from an advertiser perspective across the home page, the watch page, and the search pages, where we have different ad formats, featured videos, and the video promotion, promoted videos, which we are doing on the results pages, which he’s getting feedback from customers in terms of what they are the most interested in. I’ve certainly seen a lot of interest in the homepage mastheads which we’ve been introducing recently. 
Nikesh, do you have any other feedback from the customers?
Nikesh Arora
No, I think, Jonathan, just to add to what you said, yes, we are beginning to see that YouTube has established in the advertiser space now that the YouTube homepage is of relevance and it is desirable for customers. So we are seeing significant sell-through in most of our major markets where we have YouTube homepage for sale. 
In addition, we are beginning to see lots of interest in [inaudible] advertising, which is what customers want on the short clips that we are beginning to acquire from our major partners like Disney and the deal we did recently with Vivo. 
So I think that next phase of YouTube is going to be towards pre-roll videos on short clips and long form video [which we are in the process of doing] various deals in, which we’ve announced in the past. 
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Company
That’s helpful. Thanks. 
Patrick Pichette
We’ll go to the next question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Doug Anmuth from Barclays Capital.
Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital
Thanks for taking the question. Eric, you recently mentioned that display was the next billion dollar business and I think this is sort of a change, because I think you said search basically over the last couple of years. Is there anything in particular that has led you to sort of make this change beyond what you sort of talked about around YouTube here?
And how do you think you are benefiting at this point from the Double Click acquisition? And also curious about the Google Exchange rollout and how that fits into your strategy. Thanks. 
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
Nikesh has really been driving that area so Nikesh, why don’t you summarize where we are?
Nikesh Arora
I think the way to think about display for us is actually in multiple strands. One is clearly on the YouTube side, which you just talked about in terms of home page and pre-roll ads, which we are beginning to see some good trajectory in. 
I think to couple that, the second area of focus for us is the Google content network, where we again see that the revenues are doing well and it’s performing well. There has been sort of an aversion to more performance-based display advertising in the last quarter because most of the advertisers had started going back to focusing on CPC and clicks. 
Where we are bringing sort of the metrics of search to display effectively and we are seeing a shift away back from CPM to more CPC on the content network because display inventory continues to rise and people are beginning to want metrics to measure that. 
On the third, as you asked about Double Click integration, we have made tremendous progress with the ad exchange. We have now integrated that, the Double Click has changed with ad words and ad sense, and we are seeing traction where publishers, advertisers, agencies all want to work with an exchange that allows us to expose inventory across the board, to sort of both parties in the transaction. 
So I think Eric’s right that that is the next area where the online advertising is going to shift and we are going to see tremendous growth in the display space and we are excited about all three areas individually. 
Patrick Pichette
We’ll go to the next question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse
Good afternoon. Just two quick questions -- I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about the new trademark policy and if -- and what the results have been since you rolled that out since mid-June. 
And then just a follow-up again on the YouTube question -- when you guys talk about YouTube being on a better trajectory now, is it just a function of increasing the number of monetized views, or can you talk a little bit about maybe some of the click-through rates on the ad formats and what you are seeing now versus previously? Thank you. 
Jonathan J. Rosenberg
I’ll handle the specific question on the trademark change first. I believe we implemented that around the middle of June and basically it’s just an update to the trademark policy in the U.S. for Google.com, AFS and AFC, so that advertisers can use trademark terms in their ad creative if they are resellers or an information site for the product with the trademark, and generally we are seeing significant interest in that. I don’t have any specific revenue numbers to offer you but you can certainly try some ads yourself and get a sense of how frequently it is being used. 
On the YouTube side, Nikesh, do you have some comments?
Nikesh Arora
The YouTube trajectory has effectively been about our ability to scale, so we’ve introduced ad formats. We’ve gotten into the selling process, the selling cycle with agencies and advertisers and we’ve been able to go out and sort of train our sales force to go and make these sell-throughs happen. So the reason we are excited about it is because now we finally got all the pieces in place, the agencies that are getting into the selling process and the buying process and getting our teams ready. 
Secondly on YouTube, we are also now getting excited about the pre-roll stuff because we are beginning to bring more content. The promoted videos idea, where we can promote partner content up-front so we can shift more and more user views towards more premium content allows us to create more inventory -- couple that with the fact that our teams are now out there selling advertising as pre-roll to various advertisers, that creates the scale and the breadth that we need to go and drive this forward. 
Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse
And Nikesh, what’s the impact on the user experience on pre-rolls?
Nikesh Arora
The pre-rolls have -- if you look on the web, if you look at premium content, users are accepting that when they are going to watch premium content, they are going to have to see it supported either by some form of advertising funding or perhaps they are going to have to pay for it at some point in time. So it is becoming accepted user behavior that if they are going to watch premium content where people have invested money in creating it, they are going to watch pre-roll. 
So I think there seems to be a general acceptance around this area. 
Jonathan J. Rosenberg
We do look carefully at the drop-off rates with the pre-roll, and there’s very little drop-off, so we are generally pretty optimistic there. 
Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse
Thank you. 
Patrick Pichette
We’ll go to the next question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Jeffrey Lindsay from Sanford Bernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you. Could I ask, given the changes in YouTube, the increase in [inaudible], is YouTube actually profitable on a contribution basis or is it a net negative? And then secondly, do you intend to make any money from the operating system? Will you for example charge for it or will it be given free as part of Google Apps? How will that work? Thank you. 
Patrick Pichette
So on the first one, we don’t give the economics of YouTube. What I can tell you is that we are really pleased with the trajectory of YouTube. We are really pleased both in terms of its revenue growth, which is really material to YouTube and in the not long, too long distance future, we actually see a very profitable and good business for us, so from that perspective, we are really pleased with the trajectory. 
And on the second one, I’ll let Eric answer. 
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
On the Chrome OS, because it’s open source, we do not plan to charge for it in an open source form. There may be other ways in which we make money from it but the core operating system, if again you go and read the blog post, you will see we said this is an open source project which will be available for anyone to use. 
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford Bernstein
So that means that even though you will incur the cost of doing the development, there’s no opportunity for you to make any money with it?
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
Well, first remember we do this with a lot of products. For example, our Android product, there are many other pieces of technology that Google builds and the rough argument is that we do things that are strategic because they get people to ultimately use the Internet in a clever and new way more, and we know that as they use the Internet more, they ultimately search more or watch more on YouTube  and we then know that our advertising works in a particularly strong and targeted way. 
So we do not require each and every project to be completely profitable or not profitable. We look at them in a strategic context -- are they making the web a better place? And by making the web a better place by getting more and more people on line, especially on broadband connections, we have a lot of data that says that ultimately results in very, very strong revenue growth from us because of the targeted ads that we offer. 
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you. 
Patrick Pichette
We’ll go to the next question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Thank you. A couple of questions -- I guess when you look at OEM licensing fees and if that makes sense or not, but just broadly, what is your view on consumer paid services, if that makes sense in terms of leveraging your audience and the myriad of services that you offer today to go after somewhat of a consumer pay model, whether it be your own products or other products, say ISVs participating in Chrome OS over time?
And then second, a question around budgets of late -- as you talk to marketers and advertisers, are you hearing that they are perhaps holding back budgets until the seasonal strength of August, September, and onward, which is typical of the seasonal trend that we’ve seen in the past?
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
On the first part of the question, if our platform strategy works and if there are many users of the Chrome OS, there will be many opportunities to build profitable services on top of that platform. That’s been true for all of the successful platform plays over the history of computing and they are likely to be large if it’s successful. If it’s not successful, then it doesn’t really matter. So our focus right now is on building a truly new experience, something very different from the existing operating systems and then see how broadly that can touch people’s lives on a day to day basis in the new model of cloud computing. 
As another general statement, it is certainly my belief that you will see a duality between advertising and subscription services and that eventually monetization and the web will have a very successful advertising model, which of course Google is the leader or one of the leaders in, and also a fair number of strong and successful subscription services, which include micro payments and so forth and so on. And that infrastructure has yet to be built, in my view, broadly. But it makes sense that ultimately content will be either advertising supported or charged for and that content here includes content in the form of movies and videos and so forth, but also things like software and so forth and so on. 
So with that, that answers the first half of the question. 
Jonathan J. Rosenberg
I think the second half was just about advertiser budgets. I guess Nikesh can maybe give you a perspective from what he’s actually hearing from the advertisers. The one thing I would like to remind you there though is most of our advertisers are not maxing out their daily budgets, so they will always take more clicks if we can give them to them. So in many ways, if that’s not the right question to ask, but if Nikesh has specific views of what he is hearing from the advertiser community, that might be helpful. 
Nikesh Arora
I think, Jonathan, you are right. Effectively, what we’ve been spending our time with the advertisers is convincing them that search is an ROI based media and we can’t create inventory. Inventory depends on consumer behavior. 
So they have worked with us to open their budgets and put out there. What they said is they set very rigorous ROI benchmarks on their bidding so we understand that they will buy a click at a  certain price, but they keep their budgets open with us for the most part, which allows them to buy as much inventory as is created on that particular day. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
A quick follow-up on that ads versus subscriptions -- do you think that there’s a business model from kind of a royalty standpoint as ISVs build out apps on top of Google Chrome OS?
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
Again, too specific a question -- we don’t know yet. It makes perfect sense that there will be new forms of ad application and distribution. Exactly how they get monetized, there are probably multiple ways. There are people who are experimenting with ads inside of applications. There’s obviously the subscription model, which others are trying and we’ll know. But the good news is we can talk about this for a long time because we won’t really know for a year or two. 
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Looking forward to hearing about it more.

And we’ll take our next question from Heath Terry from FBR Capital. 
Heath Terry - FBR Capital
 
Great, thanks. Not to over-ask the YouTube question but you mentioned that YouTube monetized views have tripled year over year -- can you give us a sense of what portion that is currently? And can you talk about the challenges to monetizing the non-partner inventory that make up the rest of those views?
Jonathan J. Rosenberg
I guess I don’t understand the question with respect to a percentage. 
Heath Terry - FBR Capital
 
Well, you mentioned that YouTube had -- monetized views had tripled year over year, so I mean, I am assuming there’s a portion of those that are non-monetized. I was just curious if you could give us a sense as to maybe not exact percentages but what that portion looks like.
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
In general we don’t -- we haven’t sort of dissected all of the numbers within YouTube. The majority of YouTube views are not professional content. They are user generated content because that’s the majority of what people are watching. It’s also the majority of what is submitted. YouTube is accepting more than 15 hours of video every minute here and that’s only increasing, which gives you a testament of the power of YouTube. 
Heath Terry - FBR Capital
 
And in terms of being able to monetize the non-professional side of that inventory?
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
Has not been our focus. It’s probably possible to do so but the fact of the matter is that the majority of the non-professional content has relatively small number of viewers. It’s difficult to target it accurately. There’s too much variation and so forth, whereas the professional here and remember, professional here just doesn’t mean big studios. It also means smaller studios, new entrant start-ups who are professional quality. And you can tell a professional quality video from a user generated one. It’s easy enough. And you can tell the difference between the two. 
Heath Terry - FBR Capital
 
Okay, great. Thanks. 
Patrick Pichette
We’ll go to the next question, please. We probably have time for one or two more questions. 
Operator
And we’ll take our next question from Steve Weinstein from Pacific Crest.
Steve Weinstein - Pacific Crest
Thank you. It looks like over the last few quarters the TAC as a percentage to the network partners has been declining, and I understand that there’s all sorts of mix issues and seasonal issues that go into that but I am wondering, given the momentum that you are seeing with Ad Sense for content and display ads, if we kind of spread that trend out, if we can continue to see a downward TAC being paid out as a percent of the network?
Patrick Pichette
I’ll answer that. There’s a lot of mix issues with TAC, so first of all, when you look at it relative to last year, there isn’t these massive swings in TAC. There’s clearly mix issues, so on the ad sense and partner networks, obviously you know if you have a mix with more of your smaller partners than your larger partners, it will influence the mix that way. Clearly with Google TAC, it’s not a big change but it reflects the fact that we have more partner deals to bring people to Chrome, to bring people to toolbar. 
So there’s no really big tectonic shift in any way, shape, or form but what you see is just the effect of these mix on kind of a quarter to quarter basis just at work. 
Steve Weinstein - Pacific Crest
Okay. Thank you. 
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. We’ll take one more question, please. 
Operator
And we’ll take our final question from Jim Friedland from Cowen & Company. 
Jim Friedland - Cowen & Company
Thanks. A question on Google apps on the enterprise edition -- two parts to it. First you charged $50 per user per year. Over time is you view not only to ad services and continue to charge that level but could you also offer premium features so that you generate more revenues per customer? 
And second, as you talk to enterprises, what are the key barriers to adoption that you are hearing? Thanks. 
Eric E. Schmidt Ph.D.
At the moment, of course, we are very happy with the $50 a year model. We obviously have the opportunity to put in additional value-added services over time. We’ve got our hands full just sort of pursuing the current opportunity. I think over time you can expect we would broaden to some of those ideas on a per product basis. 
When you look at the barriers to entry in that market, they are actually pretty easy to understand. The customer has a large and existing investment in infrastructure, which is relatively highly specialized. It takes them some time to convert or adapt the systems that they have to use the new web-based computing. This of course is the fundamental narrative of these product transitions and that’s why they take so many years to go through. It’s not that the customers don’t want to make the transition. The issue is that there’s some feature or some unique thing that they depend on. 
Examples would be in the category of security services. Often the security systems are relatively highly specialized. Access to specific and often historically significant but currently not very significant database systems that they still need to have access to. Other kinds of things which are just tactical -- in other words, they just require some amount of work and over time, we will knock down some of those issues, some of those would be conversions that people will do, et cetera, et cetera. 
We focused, for example, on the most common ones -- Outlook, we’ve now launched an Outlook synch product. The use of Blackberries and particularly the BlackBerry enterprise server. We now have very good BlackBerry support as part of our apps. So those are two of the ones that we’ve been able to knock down in the last few months that have been very high priority, but there’s certainly more. 
Jim Friedland - Cowen & Company
Great. Thank you. 
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. With this, we will close the call. Let me thank everybody for taking the time to listen to our call today. Just to summarize, we are very pleased, we had a very good quarter in what is a stabilizing but a difficult economic environment. I also would like to thank Googlers for their incredible contribution in Q2. What a great progress. And thank you for listening. 
So Jonathan and I will be able to talk to you for the people that go for the second call in about half-an-hour’s time. Thanks again and with that, I’ll let the Operator close the call. 
Operator
Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference. We thank you for your participation. ",https://seekingalpha.com/article/149349-google-q2-2009-earnings-call-transcript

Presentation
Operator
Good day and welcome everyone to the Google Inc. conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Krista Bessinger, Director of Investor Relations. 
Krista Bessinger
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With us are Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of Products Management; and Omid Kordestani, Senior Advisor to the Office of the CEO and Founders. Eric, Patrick and Jonathan will provide us with the results on the quarter, and then Omid will join us for Q&A.
Please note that this call is being webcast from our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our website for important information, including our earnings press release issued a few minutes ago, along with slides that accompany today's prepared remarks.
A replay of this call will also be available on our website in a few hours. Please note that we routinely post important information on our Investor Relations website, located at investor.google.com, and we encourage you to make use of that resource.
As a reminder, we are continuing with the two-call structure this quarter. First, we will host our traditional strategic overview and Q&A with the usual format, followed by a second call, which is effectively an extended Q&A session giving the opportunity for participants to ask more detailed financial and products questions in an efficient and regulatory compliant manner. The second call will begin at 3:00 p.m. and will also be webcast from our Investor Relations website.
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding investments in our core business and growth agenda, expected performance of aspects of our business, operational efficiency in costs, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2008, as well as our earning press release for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.
Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call, such as EPS, net income, operating margins, operating income are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash providing by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Schmidt
Good afternoon to everybody. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I am going to talk obviously about the big picture, Patrick will then run through all the financials, Jonathan will put together not just products but also a whole bunch of insights about advertising.
Despite the tough economic climate, we think Google had a good quarter visited in the context of GDP falling over 6% in Q4, U.S. consumer confidence falling one-third in February, retail sales falling 9.5% a year, year-over-year in March, Google revenues were up 6% year-over-year on the back of continued strong traffic growth, down only 3% quarter-for-quarter on a revenue basis.
If you look at the economic situation, we are still basically in an unchartered territory and I think that’s just sort of the frank statement everybody wants to talk about in the business world today. The current economic environment, which everybody on the call is very, very familiar with, remains tough.
No company is recession-proof. Google is absolutely feeling the impact. Users are still searching but they’re buying less. Ultimately, what that really means is that the ads are converting less. More window and comparison shopping, purchasing lower priced goods. In other words, users are doing the right thing. They’re doing what you would expect them to do given, the enormous economic changes around us.
So advertisers are still spending but they’re lowering their bids to manage their ROI, behaving correctly in our view. So one way to say that is our advertising model is working. The user and advertising behavior that we’re seeing is entirely rational. And the auction, we base our whole business, is working to deliver great value for both.
So we think Google is now well placed for the recovery as it occurs, or when it occurs. Obviously we don’t know exactly when, and the shift continues, this is the shift to online, continues to give us a real advantage. Users migrating to the web and advertisers investing online were ROI’s highest.
It appears that the shift to online ROI as movement into our category, is outpacing any, on a relative basis, any loss in economic activity we benefit from that.
From a prioritization perspective at Google, our priorities remain unchanged: basically long-term growth. Internet growth continues, our goal is to build business and be an innovator.
In our core business, search, making it easier and faster to find things globally, we’re doing well there.
Search advertising ads on new properties, for example [inaudible] search, we’ll finance all of those Jonathan will talk about. 
We also believe that there is growth in new businesses based on superior technical insights. In display, for example, you have a highly fragmented market with multiple buyers, sellers, and data sources. By using our technology we can create an integrated product that will really improve the display as modeled. 
Look at the success of Android and the mobile space in general. By improving the mobile web experience people search many, many times more than they did in previous mobile devices. We benefit both in terms of end-user happiness as well as ultimately in strong revenue growth from that area.
And in enterprise the same thing. People are no longer thinking of IT as these expensive boxes but rather trying to apply the consumer market principles to IT, giving increased efficiency as well as higher productivity. So in that sense our mission is unchanged. 
One thing that has changed is we have just announced that after ten years of managing our global sales operations, Omid Kordestani has decided to hand things over to Nikesh, but he’s going to stay with us, he’s going to become senior advisor to the office of the CEO and founders and he’s going to be working on some new business opportunities and Nikesh will be responsible for all revenue consumer operations, marketing, and partnerships.
When I travel, when I spend time within the Google context, I see the hand-impacted brilliance of Omid and how he built the business of Google, and he will certainly—it’s impossible in an hour let alone a minute to talk about the level of contribution that he’s had. As a business founder at Google no one is better placed to advise us on issues, like future revenue growth for Google.
Nikesh, of course, also with us for many years, running our European operations, is the right person to take on everything to the next level.
So putting it into context, good quarter for Google despite tough sort of overall economic conditions, we’re still in unchartered territory, and I want to remind everybody that we are heading into the Q2, Q3 seasonally weaker quarters. We see this every year. It’s no change. We expect that will happen as well. The first quarter has demonstrated the resilience of our business model in a very severe global recession and we are going to continue to invest for the long term, as we should and as we will.
Now Patrick, would you like to proceed and take us through the financials.
Patrick Pichette
As Eric has already covered, we are continuing to manage the business well in what is a difficult economic environment.
Gross revenue was up 6% year-over-year to $5.5 billion, mostly due to the good performance of Google.com, and this despite two strong headwinds, in fact: the economy but also the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the last twelve months.
Google.com was up 9% year-over-year to $3.7 billion driven primarily by traffic growth. AdSense business, on the other hand, was down 3% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, driven by several factors. Year-over-year growth on the AdSense for search was impacting by a continuing clean up of low-quality network partners that began late in Q1 of last year, FX and general economic weaknesses, along with other quality and ROI initiatives implemented in Q1 of this year.
On the AdSense for content side, branding oriented display campaigns remain challenging in Q1 as our advertisers slowed their spend relative to the performance-based advertising. Global aggregate paid-click growth remained relatively strong, however, up 17% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter.
The U.S. growth was also fairly healthy year-over-year given the challenging economic environment, with revenues up 4% to $2.6 billion, even if down 7% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the normal seasonal trend that we see in Q1, again, exacerbated by the weak economy.
Our international revenue accounted for 52% of our total revenues, or $2.9 billion. The U.K. was down 9% year-over-year to $733.0 million but up 7% quarter-over-quarter. We did see a seasonal uptick in Q1, which is normal pattern for the U.K. but not as much in prior years due to weakness in for example, travel and finance, two very economically sensitive verticals. 
Note that our U.K. results in Q1 also benefitted from a significant gain from the expiration of a set of pound hedges that were put in place in Q3 of 2008.
The rest of EMEA is beginning to experience the slowdown seen in other countries. Ireland and Spain were clearly weaker while Germany was a relative bright spot, as well as Benowitz. Outside the U.S. and Europe, China and Brazil performed reasonably well with relatively strong growth year-over-year.
Let me now turn to expenses. Google may be an unconventional company but our Q1 margin demonstrates Google’s responsible management in light of the economic situation we all face. Q4 versus Q1 could be summarized as continued tight cost management but also lower labor costs, primarily as we reset our company bonus plan for 2009 in the first quarter.
Moving down the P&L, profit acquisition costs were $1.4 billion, or 27% of federal advertising revenue and roughly flat with Q4. Other cost of revenues decreased $41.0 million from Q4 to $666.0 million, which included $13.0 million in stock-based compensation. This decrease was driven by non-data center-related expenses, primarily payroll again.
And finally, all other operating expenses totaled $1.52 billion, including approximately $265.0 million in stock-based compensation. Please not that in Q1 our expenses include $26.0 million related to the exit of our audio and print out business as well as severance costs related to the layoffs announced, all of which impacted G&A.
Also in G&A is $20.0 million related to a proposed legal settlement in the Hasmin case. That said, expenses improved significantly from Q4 reflecting lower labor costs, as I already mentioned, primarily due to the reset of the company bonus plan at the beginning of the year.
This favorability in labor expense more than offset the various costs described above in G&A. And as a result non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes the stock-based compensation increased to $2.2 million in Q1 resulting in a healthy non-GAAP operating profit margin of 39.2%.
Note also however, that while we maintain focus on our prudent approach to managing expenses, and as Eric noted, we continue to fully fund our strategic growth areas, including for example, investments in display ads, and mobile. 
And we’re still hiring, but only in the critical areas. We had approximately 20,000 full-time employees at the end of Q1, roughly flat from Q4. We also announced in late March that we will eliminate approximately 200 positions in sales and marketing. Please note however, that these reductions are not reflected in our ending headcount numbers for Q1.
Finally, and also important to note, with slower growth rates in this challenging environment, seasonality in our results, obviously more apparent, such as what Eric mentioned, a typical summer slowdown of Q2 and Q3.
Let me quickly turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $6.0 million for Q1, down from $70.0 million last quarter. We continue to manage our portfolio responsibly and adopt a conservative approach to investing. This means that we are recognizing somewhat lower yields on our investments in Q1 relative to Q4.
Also, we realized gains on investments. Our realized gains on investments were $32.0 million. More important to note is the high volatility relative to the auction strike prices which required this quarter the acceleration of our hedging expenses as per the details of FAS 133 rule. In consequence, these accounting rules required us to recognize close to double the expense, or $91.0 million, related to our hedging programs versus Q4, of $49.0 million. 
Our hedging program continues to work well. We’re pleased that our cash flow hedging program allowed us to recognize a benefit of approximately $154.0 million toward revenue this quarter. Before hedging, the recent strength of the U.S. dollar, relative to other currencies, had a negative impact of $120.0 million on revenue in Q1 compared to the prior quarter and $429.0 million compared to the prior year.
Also, as I mentioned before, our U.K. results for Q1 benefitted from a significant gain from the expiration of some pound hedges.
We are still generating very strong operating cash flow at $2.2 billion for Q1. Capex for the quarter was $263.0 million and related primarily to our data center operation. This is down significantly from prior period. Google will continue to make significant investments to support our core business and please keep in mind that capex can be lumpy from quarter to quarter. Free cash flow also remains strong, just shy of $2.0 billion.
So in summary, we are pleased with our Q1 results, which illustrate the resiliency of our business model as well the prudent management of our expenses in these difficult time. Although we remain focused on operational efficiencies, we are not cutting any corners on our growth agenda and continue to fully fund both our core business and our growth businesses.
Finally I wish to reiterate our revenues typically exhibit seasonality for Q2 and while our revenues may be seasonal obviously our expenses are not as seasonal.
With that I would like to thank you for your time and I will turn it over to Jonathan for his thoughts on the quarter.
Jonathan Rosenberg
In the current economy Google is more focused than ever on prioritizing resources to our next multi-billion dollar business. That, of course, is search-based advertising and to find more revenue we need to make sure that we monetize our searches judiciously and to only do that in ways that benefit both advertisers and users.
You have to understand that most advertisers, even today, do not max out their daily budget. So that tells us they are willing to take all the clicks that we can give them at current CPCs. It turns out advertisers see Google as a sales channel for customer acquisition and not as a marketing expense.
The problem that they have is that if you are an advertiser and you have tens of thousands of products, if you want to run an effective campaign you need lists of key words, a creative, and a bid for each product. This takes a lot of effort to manage. So to increase our revenue, as well as theirs, we are investing in tools that make the process easier.
We see that when we build the right advertiser tools it can have an even bigger impact than the ads quality enhancements that we typically talk about on this call. One example is the conversion optimizer and that automates the bid part of the process. For advertisers who have adopted this tool, their cost per action in down 14% while conversions are up 21%.
More recently, we launched the search-based key word tool and that one automates the key word part of the process. It takes a look at an advertiser’s landing pages and then it matches those up with actual user queries. Since that launch what we’re seeing is cases where key words suggested by the tool have higher conversion rates and lower CPCs. 
We are also investing in a new AdWords front end and that’s now available to over $100,000 advertisers in twelve languages. This is actually the biggest overhaul to AdWords in the past five years and it greatly simplifies the whole campaign management and reporting process.
Over on the search side, we know a lot about how people interact with search and we can make everyone’s experience much better as a result. We launched a feature internationally this quarter that automatically gives you the best results, even if you misspell the query. 
It turns out there are over 800 ways our users misspelled Britney Spears, but with this feature we will show you right results for most of them, without the user even having to click and rerun the query with the suggested spell correction. You can go ahead and try spelling Britney poorly or if you’re a bad speller just type it wrong naturally and you’ll see. People click on these results a lot so we know that we’ve made good progress here.
Patrick highlighted in his remarks that Google has rigorous management of expenses, but we also have a history of making big investments based on technical insights and we are going to continue to do that today, especially in areas like display, mobile, and Android.
On the display side the problem that we have is a fragmented market and that makes it difficult for advertisers to run campaigns across the thousand of sites that they want to reach. So there is an opportunity to turn a complex process into something much simpler and open up the market to new advertisers.
We just launched a feature called Display Ads builder which helps do this and we want to make display ads as relevant and useful to users as search ads and that’s the intent of interest based advertising, which we also announced this quarter for beta launch in Q2.
On the mobile side, more people are accessing the web from their phones. The number of mobile searches has gone up five times in just the last couple of years and this new generation of phones has eyes, a camera; ears, a microphone; skin; a touch screen; and they know their location. This makes them a great platform for very compelling applications.
We launched Google Latitude which you can use to share your location with friends with a fun Google news cluster just this morning on Latitude helping catch a thief in San Francisco. If you go to Google news and type in Latitude thief.
We are also investing in Android to make a great mobile web experience available to everyone and over 8% of mobile browsing is now conducted through Android, which is second only to the iPhone.
Eric noted earlier the unchartered economic conditions that we face. What’s interesting from my perspective is to see how graphically search engines shed light on the state of the economy. Searches on foreclosures are up 42% year-over-year. Bankruptcy is up 53% year-over-year. Unemployment is more than doubled. We also increases in education, self-help, spirituality, and on the other side of the stress-release spectrum, alcohol and gambling.
Some of this data about traffic on specific queries is probably not surprising but our economic analysts look at things in terms of buckets and that can be more interesting. So we are seeing some surprises when you look at the categories of search queries.
Health, for example, has seen strong growth in the U.S. and it’s now one of our largest verticals. Automotive, which is an industry that is actually in dire shape, is investing more in search advertising. It could be there that they’re shifting budgets online.
We also see increases in auto maintenance and auto parts, which may be a do-it-yourself phenomena. On the online shopping side, users are looking for bargains in the mature markets and they are shifting purchasing to the web in the emerging markets.
So amidst all the economic uncertainty, we are focusing on delivering the best search experience, driving more revenue, and on investing in the key areas where our technical insights will help us make a big difference.
With that, back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
So we will turn it back to the operator to set up the call for us.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
You mentioned the impact of the phone trend on costs. Would that be the same for each quarter of 2009 or was it front-end loaded? And then second, you mentioned some U.K. pound sterling hedges expired, but would that imply that your are less hedged going into the second quarter than you were in the first quarter or that you’re hedged at less advantageous FX rates?
Patrick Pichette
In answer to your first question, we had a ramp up in Q3 and Q4 of 2008 in our bonus accruals, if you wish, because we had a very strong end of 2008. And now we are just resetting the plan for the year at the regular bonus accrual. So that’s why you see the big change. So we had a very strong end of last year and so that’s why the big discrepancy.
On the issue of the hedges, the original tranche of pound hedges were put in, you will remember, in Q3 of last year. And we are building the ladder of these hedges right over time. And it just happens now that the first tranche came to expire at the end of Q1 so we had to actually exercise them, if you wish, and we have continued through Q4 and in Q1 to continue to build our ladder.
So there is continued kind of benefit or impact of this insurance kind of policy, the way we think about it, over the coming quarters just as much, but it all depends on the spread price that we set at those times.
Operator
Your next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
I want to get back to the seasonality comment. I know you brought it up and we’ve been seeing it every year. Do you think you’re going to see any abnormal seasonality, given the recession.
And then a quick financial question. You’ve got, it looks like a 36% hedging ratio, as far as the benefit to the impact from the currency, $429.0 million over 154. Is that your target ratio or is it going to move around a lot over time?
Patrick Pichette
Can you just repeat the second question?
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
It looks like your foreign exposure was about $429.0 million hit and you’ve got $154.0 million benefit, so it looks like it was like a 36% ratio, as far as offsetting the hit. Do you think that’s what we should look for going forward or can that number move around a lot?
Patrick Pichette
So on the latter question, you can’t use it that way. The issue you have is the more volatility you have in all of these exchange rates, the more volatility you will have in all these ratios. So you can’t use a ratio and plug it forward.
Remember, I just want to remind everybody, we are not hedging revenue. We are hedging margin. And so it happens that FAS 133 forces us to actually file as a revenue for a portion of it, but it really is the margin that we are. And it’s the international portion of our revenues only. So it doesn’t affect the U.S.
On seasonality, I will let Jonathan answer it.
Jonathan Rosenberg
We don’t give forward guidance so let’s just be clear on that. But seasonality can become more visible in an environment where you have relatively slower core growth. So that is certainly a dynamic to understand. The second thing to understand is that if you look at the history of our seasonality, over many, many years, there were early years there where in many markets now where we enjoy significant market share, we were gaining market share and that can mask some of the seasonality and is less to be the case now.
Omid Kordestani
I can add more color from an advertising perspective in the different regions. In the U.S. we also saw the typical seasonal down tick in Q1 but it was exacerbated by a weak consumer although we had some interesting vertical bright spots in health, auto, and shopping. In shopping, for example, people were looking for bargains and doing maybe some of their offline purchases online, making some of those shifts. Or in a recession environment, certain auto cores like maintenance and repairs being popular.
In U.K. we saw the seasonal uptick in Q1, which is usually the reverse of the U.S. but not as much this time versus prior years due to the weakness in travel and finance. Those are economically very sensitive verticals.
And then the rest of world, emerging markets, we saw continued growth and optimistic to continue that.
Jonathan Rosenberg
The other easy thing to do is just check the calendar and look at the timing of Easter, which is different this year than it was last year, which is actually in the fourth factor.
Patrick Pichette
So for Q2 and Q3 the issues that Eric mentioned right at the front end of the call in these illustrations is simply to say that it is traditional that Q2 and Q3 are slower and so typically you should kind of think about it as that.
Operator
Your next question comes from Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan.
Imran Khan – J.P. Morgan
I think you talked about trends in different countries in Europe. This question is more about month-over-month. Did you see the business condition getting better on a year-over-year basis in March or are you seeing the same kind of trend you see in January and February. Can you give us some sense, in that you have a pretty good pulse on the economy, what kind of pulse trend you are seeing.
And secondly, my understanding is that you have a pretty large small business customers and with the credit crisis and credit crunch, what impact are you seeing on the small businesses. Are they growing slower than the overall business growth rate?
Patrick Pichette
I will let Omid actually talk about the small-medium business and I will come back to the first topic afterwards.
Omid Kordestani
It is interesting to highlight, I think we did see that effect that we actually have a difference in behavior between the smaller and larger customers and I think the way we can explain this in the case of large advertisers you typically have the CMO making decisions and looking at the spending as a marketing expense, and in this kind of downturn and the severity of the crisis that we all face, a lot of those budgets were put on hold or certain decisions were delayed and you know, our sales force and online teams are busy servicing and accessing those customers to show them performance information and OI information and all the tools that we have in our hands to help with that spending.
We did see that in the actually small to medium segment that customers continued spending and we kind of attribute that to the fact they really see this form of search advertising as a sales channel, as a way to generate leads and as long as they are gaining those leads and customers, they continue to spend.
So it was an interesting pattern that we notices.
Patrick Pichette
On the issue of month-over-month I think that the simplest answer is that a) we don’t comment on this monthly activity. I think that Eric summarized the point very well that the economic situation, it just remains difficult. And it’s a tough economy out there, whether you’re in Europe, whether you’re in North America, and that continues to be unchartered territory in so many dimensions. So that’s really how we can best portray the situation.
Operator
Your next question comes from Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners.
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
I know some of the hedging benefit goes into the TAC rates but they continue to come down but they continue to come down and I was just wondering if you could give us your philosophy on your position on TAC.
And the second question I have is actually on the licensing side. There was a fairly steep sequential slowdown and I was wondering if you could give any color there as to whether or not it was on the double-click side.
Patrick Pichette
On the TAC side, our TAC was actually kind of pretty stable between Q4 and Q1, even with the hedging benefits included. So we are not seeing continued decline. They’re actually pretty stabilizing. There is a mix shift change so that obviously between Google and the network, on one piece and the fact that we see lower TAC, in general, right now also is driven by, we see stronger growth in our smaller partners, which just have relatively lower TAC than our larger partners, so it’s no more complicated than that.
On the licensing, yes, it is the impact of double-click.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney – Citigroup.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
One on display advertising, one on cost. Both Eric and Jonathan, you talked about the display advertising. Jonathan, anything more you can tell us about the interest-based display advertising? Overall on the Internet and I guess across all advertising there is a move towards performance-based advertising, which obviously search is part of it, but in display there is probably a very significant opportunity broadly what’s missing in display advertising now and specifically what does interest-based display advertising do to solve that?
And then Patrick, any qualitative comments you care to give about how much more cost opportunity do you see, we’ve only been in there for two to three quarters but we’ve already seen a pretty material move in the margin structure so far. Do you feel like you’re early innings and the opportunities you have to right size the cost structure the way you think most appropriate.
Jonathan Rosenberg
It’s a little early to really give you deep insights on interest-based advertising. We announced that we would launch interest-based advertising on the content network and YouTube and start those deployment in data in Q2. We are very optimistic because today when you think about the way these ads are run, we are showing ads based on the context of the page the user is viewing at the moment. So for example, if you are on a sports page we might show you ads for running shoes.
But interest-based advertising, basically you use information about the sites the people visit to show them ads about the things that interest them. And we’ve certainly seen, you know, if you like cars we might show you ads for cars even if you’re not on a car site. And we think that that is very robust in terms of its ability to generate much more targeted interest. But we don’t actually yet have deep insights from customers on how that’s working in the field.
Omid may have a sense of what feedback we’re getting from customers in terms of their level of interest in display advertising but I can’t otherwise report to you data on how interest-based advertising is improving the targeting.
Patrick Pichette
I will take the second part of the question which is about costs. As we had said in Q4 and we’re saying again this quarter, given all the uncertainty in this environment I think that the Googlers, in general the entire community of our employees have been quite prudent on cost management.
On the flip side of that, we continue to fully fund all our strategic growth. Fully fund. So we are, as Eric said at the front end of the call, we are really focused on our growth agenda and we’re not stopping that. So from that perspective, I think it’s simply a balance we’re trying to strike between those two components.
I will let Eric further comment.
Eric Schmidt
My personal view on this is that it’s all about making us a better efficiency engine. That the changes and the sort of tightness with which we’re running now will put us in a stronger position as the recovery comes out. We have been able to do the things that we care a lot about and I think the company benefits from the sort of discipline that Patrick has helped lead here.

Your next question comes from Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Company.
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Company
Jonathan, going back to double-click, can you tell us about the integration and when that be done? When will you be able to finally offer the fully integrated platform for both the search and display? 
And then, if I may, on YouTube, Eric, you seem to be getting some traction with the studios getting short and long form content. Is the model, as you see it, ad-based only or do you see a potential for some fee-based, potentially even some subscription model as the platform evolves.
Jonathan Rosenberg
We basically just hit the anniversary of the double-click integration and it has been a pretty smooth integration. The good news there is we’ve gained customers on both the publisher and the advertiser side. We are pretty well on our way to being fully integrated with AdSense and AdWords. 
For example, we saw the integration of DART for publishers and AdSense completed in Q4 and that basically combines double-clicks management and control tools for publishers with the advertiser demand for the Google content network.
I’m not sure exactly how we define full integration and the details of everything that’s left, but those efforts, as well as the efforts on the ad exchange are coming along pretty nicely, only one year since the acquisition so I think we’re doing pretty well.
Eric Schmidt
And on the YouTube side, we are making very good progress now with small-, medium-, and even large-scale studios. The most interesting deal that we just announced involved Universal Music, which we announced last week which we are beyond excited about because it really redefines the business model between content owners and companies like Google.
With respect to how it will get monetized, our first priority, as you pointed out, is on the advertising side. We do expect over time to see micro payments and other forms of subscription models coming as well. But our initial focus is on advertising. We will be announcing additional things in that area literally very, very soon.

Your next question comes from Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford Bernstein .
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford Bernstein 
Can I ask two things? First of all, can you give us an indication of the percentage of YouTube that is actually carrying out at the minute and what are the sorts of rates of advertising are relative to what you had hoped they would be. And what I’m trying to understand is there significant upside potential here or do we think that YouTube is kind of reached its maximum potential on the advertising side.
And secondly, was really low. Do we think this is sustainable or are you deferring projects and what aspects of infrastructure are likely to come up in the next twelve months.
Patrick Pichette
I’ll let Omid answer the first one and then I’ll take the capex question.
Omid Kordestani
It’s early for us still to settle down on any specific trends here. We are just finding that we continue to have tremendous usage of the service. We continue to have a lot of great content and there is great advertiser interest and as you know, there is an overall downturn in the display market so what we’re doing is just working with the advertisers to figure out at what price they can work with us, how creatively they can work with us.
Today for example, on the home page, you can see a large ad format for Crank II movie opening tomorrow. So there is great interest and we just look forward to working with the advertisers both in terms of the traditional ad formats, the new ones we’re with, the transaction model that we have developed, and then basically to be able to share more with you in the future as we have better trends.
Jonathan Rosenberg
And let me just add if I may that there is a real synergy between YouTube and the display products. It’s their first and most interesting scale partner and YouTube and its adoption, which obviously is very strong, will benefit from very, very highly targeted display ad models, which is what we’re in the process of building.
Patrick Pichette
On capex, there is no doubt that this quarter again is a perfect illustration of the lumpiness of our capex and that you have to beware of models and trend lines because if you trend the last three quarters then in a couple of quarters we have no more capex. So beware of the modeling at its simplistic level.
There is no doubt though that because of the economies of scale that we have now with the size of the company and our better efficiencies, working at Mores law, doing more with less, we obviously see a positive trend that are actually demonstrated in the last few quarters but I just want to reiterate that this thing is lumpy.
For example, just as an illustration, it is public now that we have acquired a site in Scandinavia and anybody who lives around there knows that working in the winter and trying to do anything on the site, you know, there has got to be delays. So it’s just an illustration of the lumpiness of how much we can put our capex on the line.

Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital.
Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital
Is there any structural reason to think that pricing would not come back to previous levels as macro improves at some point?
And just following up on the hedging related to the U.K. can you comment on the amount of benefit that was received specifically in the U.K. due to the hedge.
Patrick Pichette
I will answer the latter first and then I will let Omid and Jonathan talk about the pricing section question.
On hedging, we don’t give any of the details of the gains. Unfortunately, we just don’t do that.
Omid Kordestani
I think advertisers are just being very rational here. They really are looking at their costs per acquisition or action and adjusting their pricing based on that. We’re not seeing any significant trends in terms of people dropping out of the auction. So our expectation is, again, as the competition increases and the dynamics return we will get back to the previous status. I just think it’s purely a results-driven rational behavior for advertisers.
Operator
Your next question comes from Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse
On mobile, can you give us a sense of what the click view rates look like on mobile relative to traditional search?
And on the cash balance on the balance sheet, any new thoughts on how you may deploy that in terms of a sizeable acquisition or perhaps returning that to shareholders.
Jonathan Rosenberg
I don’t have specific data on click through rate. We are certainly seeing more advertisers are choosing to run their ads on mobile devices. You can see examples if you query auto insurance on the iPhone or an Android device. And the RPMs on the iPhone and Android are high, even though we’re in very early days of the mobile ecosystem, but I don’t have any specific data on how click through rates differ.
Patrick Pichette
On the cash balance, obviously we do have a significant cash balance and I would love to get Eric’s thoughts on it.
Eric Schmidt
I think the most important to say is that it is not burning a hole in our pockets. $2.2 billion of incremental cash will sit in nice, safe, low-interest bearing accounts while the economic system works its way through the banking system and all of that. We continue to evaluate what we might do with the cash but our view at the moment is to remain very, very conservative and I don’t think that will change any time soon. 
We are fortunate that our very high profitability really does generate a lot of cash and that’s a nice position for us to be in.

Your next question comes from Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets.
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets
If we look at the international growth, like ex-foreign currency and ex-hedging, it looks like it’s gone from 30% year-over-year to around 22% in the first quarter, a little more of a deceleration than the 32% to 30% from Q3 to Q4. So just wanted to get a little more color on regions that you’re seeing potentially more weakness outside the U.K., on the international front.
And the second question, back to the [inaudible] accrual issue, if we look at your cash operating expense, so cost of goods ex-TAC, R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A, it went down by about $168.0 million from Q4 to Q1. How much of that decline was related to the change in bonus accrual policy versus just straight cost cutting.
Patrick Pichette
On the international front and Omid can give more color commentary on that, but essentially what I mentioned at the front end of the call is for Europe specifically there are a few countries that—the economic downturn has made its way to Europe so now obviously the effects are there and I’ve mentioned a few countries and then internationally the big cannons like China and Brazil and a few others continue to perform relatively well.
Omid, would you have any additional comments on these markets?
Omid Kordestani
Except, I think it’s consistent with the comments you opened with Patrick. In general we are seeing the lens of Google gives a lot of insights by industry and the economic conditions that we all know about. For example, finance or real estate, in specific countries are hit. And China and Brazil for example we have performed reasonably well and very strong growth year-to-year. And in markets where finance is hardly hit or real estate is hardly hit we see the same patterns.
In autos, for example, as I mentioned in my comments, there is actually robust activity in people doing repairs or maintenance of cars rather than purchasing new cars. So it’s really industry by industry and country by country kind of mirroring the activity we see in the economy overall.
Patrick Pichette
On the accrual, we don’t give all the details of the economic facts but what I can tell you it is true that it finds itself in numerous line items. So it is not only in the G&A portion but would find itself into the R&D as it is part of a labor cost. And so from that perspective, don’t be surprised to find it in a few line items. But we don’t divulge the details of it.
Operator
Your next question comes from Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart.
Sandeep Aggarwal - Collins Stewart
Eric, you mentioned towards the beginning of the call some plans in the CPC so one question is the CPC trends you are seeing, are they largely cyclical or there any secular shift in terms of not necessarily search getting matured but as search gets 13 or 14 year [inaudible].
And secondly, what kind of traction you are seeing for Android on mobile and what do you think about the potential of Android on the netbook?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I will start with your question on the CPC. I think the main thing that you are seeing is really a function of some of the remarks we made earlier. We see users are still searching but they are searching for lower value stuff, you know, used cars versus new cars, as Omid said. When they do search, they do seem to be a little bit less interest in buying and that is shown by somewhat fewer clicks and conversions.
So I think part of the dynamic, as we said, is just the auction acting rationally and the advertisers not pulling out but just cutting their bid to manage their ROI.
I think the other thing that you see across the board is there is a bit of a geographical mix dynamic when you look at overall CPC. We have high growth in some of the emerging markets like China and Brazil and there is also an FX component to the whole thing. So I think that is the set of things that we see.
As the economy comes back I have every expectation that we will see the kind of dynamics that we have seen in the past and as we get better at targeting our ad system and building tools, like some of the ones I mentioned in my prepared remarks, like the version optimizer, I think there is certainly headroom for us to target much, much better ads which could and should have higher CPCs if they are yielding better conversion.
Eric Schmidt
Overall it looks like Android is going to have a very, very strong year. We are already aware of many, many uses of Android, which as you know is open source, where literally the devices we hear about near the announcements, so the open source part of the strategy is working. We have also recently just announced an upgrade in new software for Android which is out now among the technical community and again, the stability, the proof points are really there now.
There are announcements happening between now and the end of the year that are quite significant from operators and new hardware partners in the Android space, which I won’t preannounce except to say that they really do fulfill much of the vision that we laid out more than a year ago.
On the netbook side, there are a number of people who have actually taken Android and ported it over to netbook or netbook-similar devices. So we think that’s another one of the great benefits of the open source model that we’ve used. We’re excited that that investment is occurring. And again, largely outside of Google, which we think is great.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark May - Needham & Company.
Mark May - Needham & Company
I’m hoping that someone will talk about the downsizing in your sales team recently and what your aims are in terms of how you are trying to optimize the group, just explain the rationale behind those changes.
And then second I think you highlighted health as being one of the stronger ad categories in the quarter. There were obviously some letters from the FDA with some search advertisers in that category. Are you concerned about how that might impact the health advertising search category for you going forward.
Omid Kordestani
In terms of the positions that were eliminated, it is obviously always painful for us to do that and thankful for the employees and their contributions to Google. We just have been very disciplined in how we measure the performance of each region and looking at whether we have expectations that have not materialized and do we have some investments in areas that we need to shift for example from one region to another.
So when we look at the kind of light countries in terms of their status of growth and potential and look at some of the emerging markets, we just very systematically looked at the performance and the resources that are against them and decided in certain areas, for example, that we were over-invested.
In other cases, you know, we had to align our organizations better so we had taken marketing positions, for example, and combined them with our sales force and field marketing organizations and in some cases there were overlaps in those groups and we have just been very disciplined at looking at those areas and eliminating those.
Patrick Pichette
As a complement to that point, I think it is just fair to say that when you grow so quickly in the way we did, it’s almost impossible to get everything right every step of the way. So in that sense these rationalizations are not because the business is not performing it’s just when you take a pause and it’s time to optimize a little bit more, you get these kind of opportunities that show up.
Jonathan Rosenberg
A to your question on the health ad categories, I don’t know all the details about the FDA’s issues but I know that their suggestions, I’m not sure they’re regulations, that we want to make the ads to be compliant with particular rules. They generally relate to pharmaceutical advertising and the dynamics around drugs needing to have side effects along with the benefits. 
So we are working with the advertisers to try to figure out how to get their ads in compliance and that’s certainly going to take some work. I would say that pharma is the largest component of total revenue in that category. So I think we will figure that out with the advertisers and move forward.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
You mentioned a couple of times throughout this call that your customers view you as more of a sales and distribution channel over a marketing channel. I guess, broadly, have you approached a lot of the larger companies and said lets go into the VP of sales, the CFO, the CEO, to have a conversation about how Google can help move the sales needle. And almost similar to an outsource sales force or distribution channel as opposed to going in at the marketing level, which seems to be a kind of a tough area these days.
And second, just curious, I know Twitter has been talked about in the marketplace and the media a lot of late. It seems like more of a passive communication model that is very effective. When you look at that type of business model or that concept, can you talk about how you monetize something like that in general using the existing paid search or display type ad models. I know that it’s an independent company but curious of your thoughts of a model like that.
Omid Kordestani
On the sales channels, absolutely, that’s exactly what we do and we really try to service all the senior level executives in our target customer base and named accounts. You know, make all the tools that we have from analytical tools to presentations, case studies, vertical analysis, to really demonstrate that we are a very, very strong customer [inaudible] channel.
Obviously as we are also entering into the display business more and more on YouTube there is all the branding benefits and traditional ways of reaching an audience and kind of creating the classic impressions that display advertising is wonderful for. So we are really trying to fire on all cylinders and approach it from all angles.
Eric Schmidt
On the Twitter side I think Twitter proves that innovation is alive and well in Silicon Valley and it’s really come on board very strong in the last year. It’s been around for a couple of years. And it is an incredibly useful thing, what am I doing right now.
So the question here is how could you make some money at that and without conversating specifically about twitter, because there are a number of real-time update companies like Twitter, you can imagine that to the degree that they become successful, and obviously Twitter is already doing so, it could be a channel for product information, marketing information, real-time information, for which you can hang advertising products whether it’s a text ad or video ad or so forth off to it.
And I don’t know personally their strategy but it strikes me that’s a logical strategy for them to pursue and something that we would be very happy to pursue with them and all the other players in that space.
The real great thing about Twitter is that it proves that people really want to communicate and the communication can occur in many, many different forms.
Patrick Pichette
Let me close with the last comments before we close the call formally. Just to summarize, obviously a good quarter despite tough economic conditions out there. I think the key message is around we’re still in unchartered territory. This is a tough environment for everyone. And then finally, the resilience of the model is actually pretty interesting given everything that’s been thrown at us both from the economy and the FX. Finally, I think it is really important to recognize all of the Googlers and all our partners for an unbelievable set of efforts in Q1 and I think it really is important to thank them for all their efforts.
Eric Schmidt
And let’s make sure we also thank Omid for his extraordinary service to the company, which will continue in a new form. Omid thank you very much.

Good day and welcome everyone to the Google Inc. Conference Call. This call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Krista Bessinger, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Krista Bessinger
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's fourth quarter 2008 Earnings Call.
With us are Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer joining from New York; Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; and Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of Products Management, both joining from Mountain View; and Omid Kordestani, Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Operations is joining from London. Eric, Patrick and Jonathan will provide us with the results on the quarter, and then Omid will join us for Q&A.
Please note that this call is being webcast from our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our website for important information, including our earnings press release issued a few minutes ago, along with slides that accompany today's prepared remarks.
A replay of this call will also be available on our website in a few hours. Please note that we routinely post important information on our Investor Relations website, located at investor.google.com, and we encourage you to make use of that resource.
In addition, please note that we're moving to a two-call structure this quarter. First, we will host our traditional strategic overview and Q&A with the usual format, followed by a second call which is effectively an extended Q&A session giving the opportunity for participants to ask more detailed financial and products questions in an efficient and regulatory compliant manner. The second call will begin at 3 PM Pacific and will also be webcast from our Investor Relations website.
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding investments in our core business, expected performance of aspects of our business, profit acquisition costs, operational efficiency in costs, our expected level of capital expenditures, and our proposed option exchange program, including the expected resulting modification charge. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to provide or publicly release the results of any revisions of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 as well as our earning press release for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.
Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call, such as EPS, net income, operating margins, operating income and our effective tax rate, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. We've also adjusted our net cash providing by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Schmidt
Thank you very much, Christa, and good afternoon to everybody on the call. As she mentioned, we're making a couple changes here. In particular, Patrick and I are going to be taking the lead on these calls, and Larry and Sergey will occasionally attend. They continue to focus on technology and product innovation which, of course, they do so very, very well.
Looking at the quarter, we had a strong quarter, and I want to thank everybody for their hard work, both customers, employees, and all the people who made this possible. We had strong search query growth year-on-year, with revenue up in most verticals and we had tight control over costs, something which had eluded us perhaps in the past, but we got the formula down now.
The results, we think, show that advertisers' value targeted measurable ads. In the fourth quarter advertisers invested where ROI was the highest, and it was online. That's one of the few really good stories in the past quarter. Our sales force went out to tell people it's really important to understand that revenue is what you need, and the quickest way to get revenue is to use targeted Google advertising and its strategy had worked very well for us.
Consumers, of course, are also using search for comparison shopping and that helped as well. As you'll see in our results, we took significant write-downs with AOL and Clearwire, as write-downs are mandated by the way the accounting works. Both deals made sense to us then and make sense to us now, and continue to be a strategic part of our overall business philosophy.
Now, looking at the economic situation which is on everyone's minds, in some ways Q4 was the easy part. After all, we had holidays, had excess inventory and so forth. Now we're in a situation, where last quarter we said it was going to be unchartered territory, it's now clear we're in a worldwide recession as everybody knows, rising unemployment, foreclosures, that sort of thing. But we don't know how long this period will last. We, obviously, hope it will be short, but we're certainly prepared to get through this, no problem.
From Google's perspective, in the short-term we're doing ongoing prudent management of our business, and that means the kind of actions that we've taken in the last quarter and we're prepared to continue that focus.
In the long-term, we're obviously very optimistic about Google and its future. It is absolutely true that users shift to the web and advertising is moving online. Both those trends are fundamental and they benefit Google, and obviously, our company, our employees and our shareholders.
Now, we're in this for the long haul. Another issue that we faced in the last couple of quarters is that about 85% of our employees have at least some stock options that are underwater, which, for most of you, I think, know the exercise price is significantly higher than the current market price of a common stock. So we're going to offer people an opportunity to do a Stock Exchange.
Our theory here is that part of the compensation in stock is how it happens in high-tech and it needs ultimately to have some value over the long-term. This, obviously, is a voluntary program and the number of shares subject to outstanding options will not change as a result of this exchange offer, although there may be more ultimately exercised, which may ultimately result in a change in that number.
Total options are expected to represent 3% of total shares currently outstanding. As part of the bargain that we're working with employees, they have to give up 12 months of vesting, literally have 12 months of vesting added, and they have to wait 6 months to exercise. We think that's a good deal for shareholders and for our employees as well.
We're also, of course, focusing on new opportunities, which means we've been looking at things which have not been performing as well as we wanted. We've discontinued some products with low impact and that has been widely covered. We will continue to review that.
So, our core focus is on the huge untapped potential of search and ads. Search: more dynamic; less static; empower people to use. SearchWiki is a current example where people can add a search quality, and tell us how to make the search better and so forth and so on. Overall, just better search quality. Wouldn't it be nice if Google understood the meaning of your phrase rather than just the words that are in that phrase? We have a lot of discoveries in that area that are going to roll out in the next little while.
On ads we're producing: more relevant as against more commercial queries every time. Relevancy against commercial queries equals ROI, which equals revenue for Google. We also have very significant advanced bidding measurement and optimization tools underway because we know that larger advertisers are willing to take more clicks if we can give them the tools to generate those clicks. Of course, obviously, the local market remains very large.
We're also focusing on products with the greatest potential for transformation. Google is at its best when we transform markets or ideas or how information works and displays, for example, Booklet creation is almost complete, a business plan is in place. We're really trying to bring the science of search to the art of display, somewhat, to think about it, increasing relevance, greater ability to measure results, and an integrated one-stop-shop for advertisers and publishers and increase choice. For example, for YouTube, part of Google, we are very optimistic that we'll see breakthroughs in 2009.
In the area of Android and mobile, we're going to open up mobile devices to developers to stimulate innovation. As an example, 800 free apps are already onto the Android marketplace and making the mobile Web much more user friendly, with billions of page impressions already available through the G1 phone.
The enterprise same argument applies. The Cloud is now mainstream, and it's having a big impact on lots of companies, and by focusing on, for example, the one million Google Apps business customers we can get enterprise quality applications hosted by Google at a dramatically lower price, really makes a big difference, especially with people who are looking for areas to control costs.
Big businesses are using applications already: Genentech, Apago, the Washington DC Government, for example, and we also have a big reseller program there that has just been launched, where we had more than 1000 resellers apply to the program.
So looking back, we had a strong quarter, ending what turned out to be a strong year. Business is quite healthy, especially, given the tough economic climate. We're very much focused on the long-term. We have confidence in our technology and our people, and our enduring power of the Web, and how users will use the Web in the future.
So with that, Patrick, maybe you'd like to take us through the financials? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Eric. Good afternoon, everyone. Well, we had another solid quarter, and this despite a challenging economic environment, to say the least. Gross revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $5.7 billion, reflecting a healthy growth across both google.com and the AdSense for content network. Google.com was up 22% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, driven by a steady traffic growth and a significant number of ads quality launches this quarter.
AdSense was up 4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, driven by decent performance in our AdSense for content network. This was partially offset by the impact of the clean-up efforts on our AdSense for search network, as we continue to focus on delivering high quality traffic to our advertisers. Our global aggregate paid-click growth was also reasonably good. It was up 18% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting healthy growth across all major geographies. Good growth in the US with revenues up 13% year-over-year to $2.8 billion and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. International revenue also held up reasonably well accounting for 50% of total revenue or $2.9 billion.
The UK did show some softness largely due to the currency, though. It was down 1% year-over-year to $685 million and down 12% quarter-over-quarter. The rest of EMEA Europe performed much better, driven by strong performance in Germany, France and the Netherlands. Asia and Latin America were solid as well, driven by the relatively good performance of Brazil and China.
Let me turn now to expenses. As a reminder, we have three broad categories. First, traffic acquisition costs were $1.5 billion for this quarter. This is 27% of total advertising revenue and we're down from 28% in Q3; second, are the costs of revenue, those increased by $29 million over Q3 to $707 million. The largest driver of the increase datacenter related costs, including depreciation, equipment and operations. Finally, all other operating expenses totaled $1.65 billion, including approximately $286 million in stock based compensation.
As we stated before, it makes sense in a difficult economic environment to maintain a clear focus on operational efficiency and cost containment. To this end the Googlers have clearly responded to the call in Q4. As a result, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock based compensation, reached $2.1 billion for Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 37.6%.
Our prudent approach to expense management is also reflected in our headcount numbers. We had approximately 20,000 full time employees at the end of Q4. As mentioned previously, we do continue to hire, with approximately 100 net new employees added this quarter.
A few other topics are clearly worthy of mention this quarter. First, note that we recognize approximately $1.1 billion in strategic investment asset impairment charges related primarily to our investment in AOL and Clearwire in Q4. These charges have been excluded from our non-GAAP results, but are detailed in our earnings press release.
Also, our non-GAAP effective tax rate before these impairment charges, stock-based compensation and related income tax effect was 27%. The increase from 24% in Q3 was primarily due to the increase in earnings in countries with higher statutory tax rates as well as the effect on earnings of various hedging activities. This was partially offset by certain benefits, primarily in R&D tax credits, which was enacted several months ago, before which we took the entire 2008 benefits in Q4.
On FX now, it's clear that currency was working against us again this quarter, but our hedging programs continue to work well. Before hedging, the recent strength of the US dollar relative to other currencies had a negative impact of $334 million on revenue in Q4 compared to prior quarter. We're pleased that our cash flow hedging program allowed us to recognize a benefit of approximately $129 million to revenue this quarter.
I'm also pleased to report that operating cash flow remained strong at $2.1 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $368 million. As in previous quarters, the majority of this CapEx is related to our IT infrastructure investments, including datacenters, production of servers, and networking equipment.
I wish to note here that Google will continue to make significant investments in CapEx in future period. Our free cash flow remained also strong at $1.8 billion, up 73% year-over-year.
But before closing, let me quickly touch base on the exchange offer program we announced today and that Eric talked about a few minutes ago, which would, when launched, offer employees the opportunity to participate in a voluntary 1 for 1 exchange of their underwater stock options.
As Eric mentioned, the program is intended to help us motivate, but also retain our employees. A number of Google shares subject to the outstanding options will not change as a result of the exchange offer, although a lower stock price attached to the new options will increase the likelihood that they'll ultimately be exercised.
The options expected to be exchanged represent, as Eric said, 3% of total shares outstanding. To increase retention, the new options will have 12 months added to their original vesting schedules, and in addition, new options will vest no sooner than 6 months after the close of the offer period.
We do expect to take a modification charge estimated to be about $460 million over the vesting period of the options to be exchanged. These vesting periods range from six months to approximately five years. If the offer launches as expected, this modification charge will be recorded as additional stock-based compensation beginning in the first quarter of 2009.
Please note that the terms and timelines of the exchange offer may change, and we encourage you to read the documents we will file with the SEC when the exchange offer commences.
So, in summary, from a financial perspective, our core business continues to demonstrate strength despite a challenging economic environment. While we're focused on operational efficiency, we have and we will continue to make crucial investments that drive value for our users, our advertisers, our partners and for Google in the long-term.
With that, thank you for your time, and I'll turn it over to Jonathan for his thoughts on the quarter. Jonathan?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Okay. Thanks, Patrick. I think I'd like to just take a few minutes to cover some of the top product accomplishments from both the quarter and the year. I'll start, of course, with search.
So we launched over 350 search quality improvements in 2008. The biggest addition was the size of our index, and that grew substantially over the year. I think people often forget that it's the behind the scenes work that keeps our results fresh and comprehensive. So, I wanted to remind folks that the index matters. We also worked very hard on latency across the board that was not just on search, but, in fact, on all of our products.
We've also mentioned universal search on many calls this year, and for perspective over 2008, we tripled the number of queries that trigger different types of results across images, videos, news, blogs, websites, and of course, books.
Blending books is particularly promising because we've now reached a settlement to our lawsuits in the US with book search. If that's approved by the court, millions more in copyright books will be accessible to the searcher. Many of them will be available for purchase even if they're out of print. So, in that area, in effect, we feel like we'll be creating a whole new market for out of print books.
Our founders have said something to the effect that even a great search engine won't help much if the content you're looking for isn't online. So, adding more books and expanding our index are very, very important efforts.
It's also clear more people are searching from mobile phones and they're doing that more often. Our general objective there, with mobile, is simply to make search from a mobile phone as easy and as fast that as it is from a computer. In some cases, like with the voice search feature that we launched this quarter for iPhones, we're making it even easier. You basically just pick up your phone and talk. I mean it couldn't be much easier than that.
With all of our improvements, mobile search traffic went up substantially this year and not surprisingly it peaked at the end of December.
We're also excited to work with T-Mobile to bring the first Android phone to market, which we did in US in October. It's done very well today, and I'm pleased to personally report I have two happy and dedicated teenage G1 users in my own house. There are more phones in the works, so we think Android will spread innovation and competition in the mobile world.
On the ad side, I think you all have probably already surmised that this was, in fact, one of our strongest quarters for ad quality improvement. We're going to keep working to get smarter about which ads we show users so that the queries that should have ads do have ads.
I think you also know that our ads coverage dipped some earlier in the year and Sergey alluded to that on some of the previous earning calls. Some of our launches this quarter helped us increase coverage, but keep in mind, we're now only back to about where we were at the beginning of 2008 from a coverage perspective.
We're also working to make it easier for our advertisers to create and run great campaigns. This quarter we beta launched the search-based keyword tool. That, of course, helped advertisers identify relevant queries on which they're currently not running any ads.
Also, remember, most of our advertisers don't max out their daily budget. So there's really a lot of opportunity there if we can just figure out how to deliver more clicks to them. It's also a lot of work to create a display campaign. So many AdWords customers don't bother and we're working to fix that too. There we launched the display ad builder to let advertisers create nice looking display ads and they do that directly from the AdWords interface.
A good example there is triprez.com. They had not, in fact, done display advertising before, but they're now running a campaign for Las Vegas travel packages on lots of Las Vegas related sites.
YouTube, of course, is emerging as a key component of our display strategy. This quarter we, of course, launched the Sponsored Videos. People are browsing for videos hundreds of millions of times a day and Sponsored Videos is a great way to show them relevant and useful ads. You can try querying a movie on YouTube as a good way to see some of them.
We also launched over 100 feature releases to our application suite in 2008, and of course, the big advantage there of those web-based apps is how quickly and easily you can push new features out to customers and that you can build apps that otherwise wouldn't be available to businesses, like chat in Gmail, which we launched in Q4 and I hope you guys have tried.
Momentum is particularly strong in the apps area. We now have more than a million businesses on apps with over 10 million users and over 3 million active users from schools.
Perhaps the thing I'm most proud of this year is how we worked with Patrick's team to establish much more mature business practices, while maintaining our culture of innovation. In the fall, we conducted a whole series of thorough resource and technology reviews and all of that led to more focused resource allocations going into 2009.
The review process that we created is now basically a part of how we do business, but at the same time, we've added this good business process in rigor. The pace of innovation at Google is still very strong.
Chrome is a great example of that innovation. It's fast. It's stable. It's gotten great user momentum since we launched officially in Q4. So, we hope, Chrome will spur even greater innovation both within Google, and of course, externally, and we hope Chrome will make the web better for our users, our customers, our partners, and of course, for all the Wall Street analysts that we have here on the phone as well.
So, Happy New Year and thank you, and back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks, Jonathan. We will today be conducting the Q&A with the operator, simply because Eric is in New York and I'm in Mountain View. So I'll turn it back to you, operator, and then give us the rule for the Q&A, please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions). And we will take our first question from Ben Schachter from UBS.
Ben Schachter - UBS
Hey, guys can you talk about video a bit in terms of what have been the biggest barriers to making that more meaningful and why haven't we seen more experimentation around the types of ad units that are available on video? And then, related to that, is there anything Google is doing to help get video directly to the television sets across America, across the world? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
I'll let Eric introduce the subject and then Jonathan may have additional comments.
Eric Schmidt
Ben, we have introduced three new video formats in the last four to five months. This is for advertising now. Each of them is having some traction. I think it's fair to say that we've not found a single solution that really drives revenue, for example, widely, and we're certainly working on that.
From the standpoint of getting video to the devices, there are quite a few deals in the way now or on the way now, which are basically anything that you can do on television you can also do from YouTube, and virtually all of the new device manufacturers, and there are some that have been announced already, have the ability not only to display Internet content with video, but also YouTube content. We would expect eventually your vision to be realized. It's just a matter of the product cycle of the partners.
Patrick Pichette
Jonathan?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure. Hi, Ben. We actually have done quite a few experiments. I mean, you know, there are multiple ad solutions that we have been working with on YouTube. It's hard to match the right format with the right content, but as Eric mentioned, we've got a few attempts there. We've obviously got the in-video ads and the click rates there are very good. They're many times that of standard click to play video ads. There's also these contest videos, which I mentioned once this quarter. The contest platform, the homepage sponsorship, the click-to-buy work that we've done as well, but I think the hardest part there is we've got to find a way to come up with a standardized format that works and makes the creative development of the ad much, much easier. So, I think, that's a significant constrain.
On TV, we have extended the reach of Google TV ads with a bunch of cable networks. We signed NBC, Universal and six new networks, including CNBC and MSNBC this quarter. So I think there is pretty good progress there.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks. We'll go to the next question, please. Operator?
Operator
And we'll go next to Imran Khan from JPMorgan.
Imran Khan - JPMorgan
Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions; If I look at your paid clicks growth rate, it was 10% sequentially versus fourth quarter revenue growth rate of 3% year-over-year. So I am trying to understand the dynamics of the price bucket. It seems like probably the revenue per click went down, but I understand the verticals?
And, the second question is, if you look at your partner revenue growth rate significantly underperforming the google.com revenue growth rate, trying to better understand, what percentage of that revenue growth faster growth rate, is attributable because the partner's volume is not growing, versus advertisers for allocating more dollars on the google.com site because they're seeing better conversion? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
I'll just give a quick summary of some of the mix issues and then I'll turn it to Omid and Jonathan. Just very quickly on the mix issue, it is true, that in a relative sense, the AdSense revenue was weaker. We should say, though, that the AdSense for content actually had a relatively strong quarter, and we're pleased with that. In the case of AdSense for search, we work closely with all of these partners to improve the quality, but we do quite a bit of arbitrary clean-up in Q3 and Q4 to make sure that we do provide the best information, but I'll turn it over to Omid for more details as well, Jonathan, afterwards.
Omid Kordestani
Thanks, Patrick. Yes, again on the network I'd just like to emphasize with you that number of quality measures to remove some of the arbitrage that was happening under various parts of that network and that clean up led to some of that downturn that you saw in the numbers. In terms of Capacity, we don't break out the CPC number specifically, but a big impact on it had to do with unfavorable changes in the euro and the pound exchange rates.
Then, aside from FX, we just have various drivers that have to do with the mix in our business. Growth rate in emerging markets, for example, versus developed markets, where newer markets tend to have lower prices and therefore, put a downward pressure on CPCs. Different property mixes, google.com versus the network has different characteristics and different pricing dynamics in the auction.
And the other interesting factor is that advertisers find new less-monetized keywords and we have a number of launches that we have done where we actually improved the coverage of that by helping the advertisers automatically take advantage of more keywords. Some of the new keywords will have lower CPCs, again, they put downward pressure on the pricing. Again, all of this, in long-term, in our view, is going to improve the quality and improve the auction dynamics over time. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Are you okay Jonathan?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I think that really did pretty much cover it all, yes, FX, its mixed issues. I think the only thing we didn't mention is that advertisers are looking very carefully at conversions in ROI, and so, one of the dynamics that I think we did see, is the consumers are doing more comparison shopping. So they're clicking more, but in some verticals they are not necessarily converting as much, or maybe what they're engaged in is smaller purchase sizes. They're buying things that are a little less expensive. So the auction is working. The advertisers are basically adjusting their bids to maintain their ROI or even enjoy the slightly increased ROI, which we've typically seen in December and we saw again this year. Brazil and China are probably the examples when we talk about mix of countries of markets where we saw growth, but it's, presumably, growth, its modestly lower CPC.
Imran Khan - JPMorgan
Great. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. We'll go to the next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thank you. First on the call today Microsoft indicated a slowdown in activity in the last six months and I'm just wondering if you see anything abnormal that you want to highlight since the holiday season? And then, the second thing is, just on the ratio of the foreign exchange hedging, it looks like there was a $266 million year-over-year impact, and it looks like in your release you had a $129 million benefit. Is that the kind of ratio we could kind of think about going forward? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
On the issue of what's going on in the market, I mean, I think, everybody knows we don't comment on what's going on in the market and we don't speculate and we don't give guidance on it. On the issue of the FX, there are two things we should remember. One is, Q4 was an extraordinary quarter from a volatility point of view. So that's the first message. Everybody that's running models right now is probably scratching their heads, given that the pound went from $1.80 something to $1.50 something in a matter of weeks. It just threw the entire market kind of for a spin and in that context that's why we've had the results that we've had.
In some cases we've had a lot more benefits because of these hedges. In the case of the UK, I can mention that we have put most of these in Q3 and they really are taking hold in Q1 of this year. So, we had a partial benefit. So, it wasn't perfect for Q4. All this said, though, one last point is, you got to remember that we do hedge bottom-line not topline. So, we're not trying to match revenue for revenue, because of FASB 133. We are really looking for bottom-line hedging, and that's why you see a proportion. So the models are really porky this quarter, because of all these factors at play, and second is, always remember, we're not hedging for revenue, we're hedging for bottom-line.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
You're welcome. We'll go for the next question.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from James Mitchell from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Mitchell, your line is open.
Patrick Pichette
James? If you're on mute; we'll go to the next question and then we'll come back to James.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse
Two quick questions. First, CapEx was down in the quarter pretty significantly and down on a full year basis and, I know, Patrick, I think you said that you would continue to make significant investments, but is this kind of a normalized level? That's question one. And then, the second question was, looking at the cost structure of Google now, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how flexible the cost structure is, maybe excluding the percentage of the costs or fixed versus variable versus semi? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Okay. So on CapEx, first and foremost is, we are really glad of the performance of CapEx this quarter. Again, it's a combination of two things that are at work. I just want to reiterate we are investing, and we are investing and never jeopardizing the quality of the experience and the robustness of our infrastructure.
It just happens that we are benefited by two factors, one is we are benefiting from economies of scale, as well as the greater efficiencies of our infrastructure. So, if you think of the Moore's Law at work; get a cheaper cost for equipment as well as better utilization. So, all of these factors we really push hard on, and therefore are gaining benefits.
The second factor, which is also quite important in the modeling, is it's lumpy. Big data centers are lumpy in the way that they are invested. So, in that sense, I'd be careful about looking at one quarter to make a forward-looking modeling assumption. So we're pleased about our performance. Obviously, we don't give guidance, but we are committed to making sure that we invest to make sure our infrastructure is robust.
On the cost structure point of view, I think that if you look very simply at Google, I mean you really have a cost structure. If Hal was here, he would say all costs are variable in the long run. So that makes the answer easy. But the real issue is we're a labor-intensive business. We have a lot of labor. And so, depending on your views on labor, right, I mean we take care of our employees. We have a lot of flexibility within our model and we're going to continue to manage the business responsibly in that sense.
Having said that, there is no doubt that in the mindset of the company, we really are. Having finished my first six months around here, I think that it is true. We are managing this business for the long-term. There is no doubt about it. The decisions are built on that basis. So, I hope that answers your questions.
Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse
It does. Thank you very much.
Patrick Pichette
We'll turn to the next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney from Citigroup.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thank you. Patrick, one question for you; Eric mentioned that he got the formula down now for cost controls. How much more opportunity do you think there is? You've only been there for a quarter and a half; do you feel like you're just starting to find ways to cut costs or do you think we saw that major impact of what you can achieve already in the quarter?
And then a quick question on CPC. If you could help us think through how deflationary CPC trends could be in an environment where, the millions of advertisers on Google, some of them must be going out of business, people have got stretched advertising budgets or reduced advertising budgets. Of all the different mix factors, how much of CPC pressure could we see on the downside, just from core recessionary factors? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
I'll answer the first question, and I'll let the combination of Jonathan and Omid maybe comment on the second. On the first one, I think that you have to keep in mind that the mindset of the company is to be a growth company. I think that Eric, Larry, Sergey always pounded into every management meeting that, we're a growth company and we're focused on growth.
So, in a certain way, we are really focused on growing this company. In that sense, I'd love to have more cost because I have more revenue and we're going to continue to focus on that. On the issue of, is there more available cost cutting or efficiencies available? All I'd say is we're just managing responsibly given the environment.
Let me turn around the CPC question to Jonathan.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure, Mark. I think it's pretty easy. A recession actually causes less commerce to take place. If there were fewer transactions, then that would adversely impact us and you'd see revenue going down. I don't think you'd sort of see a CPC-based deflationary spiral because some modest number of businesses went out of business. I think that the auction is pretty robust. There are many, many other businesses behind that subset of businesses that would come into the auction if there was a transaction that was going to be consummated.
So I think it's really a function of whether or not overall commerce is reduced. In the end, the CPC question, the way we see it, is really driven by users and it's not quite as much the number of advertisers coming in and out at any given time.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thank you, Jonathan. Thank you, Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you. We'll go to the next question, please.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from James Mitchell from Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you for taking my question this time. Can you discuss why traffic acquisition costs were down quarter-on-quarter and can you talk about the taxation of the FX hedging benefits?
Patrick Pichette
Yes. The reason for TAC down quarter-over-quarter is due for mixed reasons for the most part, because as you can think about it, our mix between Google.com versus all other partners, is the primary force for that.
On the tax of the hedging, could you just give me more precision on your question, please?
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
I think in the introductory remarks, you mentioned that the effective tax rate increased from 24% to 27%, and you cited one of the reasons for that as being the FX hedging benefits. I assume that there's some sort of capital gains related tax or something?
Patrick Pichette
Yes. Thank you for your clarification. So here's the issue. I mean, in a very simple world the following happens. Our hedging program is not made for the wide ranges of benefit or loss that we would have seen with the huge fluctuations of this quarter if you think of it in these extraordinary times.
So, if you do have a huge disparity in a currency and you end up with a large benefit that is US-based, it will be taxed in the US. The reverse of that, the loss is on the euro side, you get all the benefit in the US. You have the loss on the other side. The net is, you end up paying taxes more than you would have thought. So, if it's a small number, it doesn't matter. If it's a bigger number, then it becomes more material.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
It's purely because the general tax rate is higher in the US than in Europe?
Patrick Pichette
That's correct. That's exactly right.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs
Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
You're welcome. We'll go for the next question, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth from Barclays Capital.
Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital
Thanks for taking my question. First one is on the distribution deals, and in particular, can you talk about how your philosophy has changed on distribution deals like Dell and Verizon recently, and what were the primary reasons you did not win those deals and would you expect to maintain most of the query volume from the Dell deal? Then, just the second one for Jonathan, in terms of coverage, you mentioned that you're just back to early '08 levels. What kind of levels would you like to be at and how do you think about that going forward? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Great. I'll let Omid answer the first one and then we'll pass it on to Jonathan.
Omid Kordestani
Hi. On the distribution deals we're engaged in, all of these partnerships and renewals discussions are new ones. First, we have a number of opportunities from different segments, PC manufacturers to software companies that bundle our various toolbars or Chrome. We do very sophisticated business modeling and are looking at the value of this traffic to us, and then ultimately we're just willing to pay a certain amount of that distribution.
So, there are other factors that enter these negotiations, competitive dynamics, other benefits that a partner may get from a different provider, a very competitive environment and we believe there's a lot of choice there. We have alternative opportunities for distribution. So we have a very active program. We are happy with the forecast that we have and the alternatives that we have to distribute the products.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks. Jonathan?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Yeah. On coverage, I think the answer is, we don't know what the optimal coverage level is. You know, it certainly depends on the dynamics of the mix of commercial versus noncommercial queries and how that changes over time. So, we'd really like to show fewer ads on the searches and the queries that don't really want them, and we'd probably like to show fewer better ads on the queries that do. So, we don't have a clearer answer than that.
Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks. We'll take another question.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Christa Quarles from Thomas Weisel Partners.
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
Hi. First question was, I think, Hal said last quarter that, advertisers would take as many clicks as they could get at current prices. I was wondering if you still stand by that, I guess, relative to the comments that were just made as it relates to potentially ROI discipline waning in Q4, and then maybe back and forth in Q1? And then, the second question, I was just wondering if you could add any color or commentary on how SNBs with us and Fortune 500 marketers acted in Q4? Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Great. I'll let Omid talk to both of these points, he has great insights on it.
Omid Kordestani
Hi. On the first question, very much Jonathan talked about earlier. Advertisers acted very rationally in the quarter. They lowered their bids in certain cases, certain verticals, and looked basically for proper returns on their campaigns rather than just dropping out. And a majority of our revenue comes from advertisers that do not max out on their campaign budgets. So basically what Hal said is that they'll max out, they'll take more clicks if we can deliver them and that's a very good trend for us.
The other factor, to your second question, that we saw is that quite a bit of diversity, actually in the way the customers are behaving, some of the larger customers are definitely in a mode where they're evaluating their marketing budgets, and any kind of savings that they can undertake, they do and they put some of these marketing spending and budgets on freeze. And what we're finding, though, is that among those big customers, the ones who have been online and are familiar with the benefits and the metrics and are doing the measurements and using analytical tools to do the kind of marketing that we provide, they continue to take advantage of this.
They just perhaps lowered their CPCs or change their campaign sizes, but, in general, we're seeing again the ones that are sophisticated, understand how to market with us, they stay with us. We're seeing robustness actually in the smaller segments of our customers. Again that just speaks to the fact that they understand the metrics and they're willing to pay for those clicks based on the measurements that they have.
So it's hard to again predict with the visibility still not clear for us and we're hard at work in the field calling on all the segments and servicing all the segments of the customers.
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
Okay. Thanks.
Patrick Pichette
Jonathan, a few comments?
Jonathan Rosenberg
The small and medium advertisers we actually have some data on and I think Omid's statements are all absolutely, directionally correct. What we see is that small and medium advertisers tend to cut their ad budgets back less than the larger direct advertisers. We think what happens there, is that the larger advertisers are much more prone to doing more across the board; media; spend cut; but most of our advertisers basically don't max out their daily budget, and because every single conversion is ROI positive for them, they're basically willing to take as many positive ROI conversions as we can give them.
Patrick Pichette
Great, thank you. I just want to say that because of the distributed aspects of our call today, with Eric in New York and Omid in London, we'll take one last question now and then, obviously, invite everybody who wants to participate for the follow-up call. So we'll go for the last question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Heath Terry from FBR Capital Markets.
Heath Terry - FBR Capital Markets
Great, thank you. I was wondering if you could kind of give us an idea of the strategy for the display advertising side of the business, particularly, first as it relates to the DoubleClick Ad Exchange and its development? And then, second, to the display advertising inventory that you have on YouTube and your other non-search sites?
Eric Schmidt
Yes. I'll let Omid cover this, please.
Omid Kordestani
Hello. First of all, we are doing very well with the DoubleClick integration. As Eric mentioned, the business plan is set and the product roadmap is really set and delivering every month, every quarter. We're starting to see that we're getting more inventory actually because we're doing a great job of monetizing it.
DoubleClick is getting integrated with the Google systems for the publishers. This means, that with AdSense Systems, we have DSP and have beta launched a number of features. Publishers basically can make more inventory available to us and we monetize it with AdSense only if the publisher can't sell that higher price, which is again, a great way for the publishers to optimize the sales of their inventory.
For advertisers who are working on integrating AdSense for content tools with DFA products. YouTube is fully integrated into the Google display platform, and in effect, YouTube is a client of these systems. The DoubleClick video product is the way that YouTube sells the video inventory on a reservation basis, and we use AFC AdSense for content on YouTube for sales of auction-based inventory.
Again, we still believe that this is a great market for us. They're very fragmented. It's really ready for better measurements and better optimizations for both publishers and advertisers and we're having great success with the DoubleClick team and Jonathan's team is doing a great job by integrating the products as we're gaining more traction here.
Heath Terry - FBR Capital Markets
Great, thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Just as we close the call, in conclusion, I think, just to reiterate the points Eric made at the very beginning of the call; very strong quarter, ending a strong year, I think pleased with the results, especially given the tough economic climate and all of these unchartered waters and territory we've gone through. We're delighted to have a healthy business through this.
Clearly, we remain focused on the long-term. We have confidence in our technology, our people and the enduring power of the web that really pushes us.
So, with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to close the call.
Operator

Please note that this call is being webcast from Investor Relations website. Please also refer to our Investor Relations website for important earnings related documents including our press release issued a few minutes ago along with slides that accompany today's prepared remarks. A replay of this call will also be available on our Investor Relations website in a few hours.
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today maybe considered forward-looking including statements regarding investments in our core business, traffic acquisition cost, operational efficiency and cost and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
Please refer to our SEC filings including our quarterly report on form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, as well as our earnings press release for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies can be obtained from the SEC, or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. Also please note that certain financial measures we use on this call such as EPS, net income, operating margin and operating income are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities, to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.
With that it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Schmidt
Well. Thank you, very much, Krista, and good afternoon everybody. First, let me welcome Patrick, Patrick Pichette, who is of course our CFO, who is off and hit the ground running. He certainly joined us at an interesting time. Before he goes into the detail, which of course everyone is quite interested in.  Let me just talk about some of the highlights.
Thanks to everybody's hard work. Google had a good quarter. Traffic and revenue were both solid and we kept tight control on costs. Year-on-year, for example, search query traffic is growing in almost every vertical. We believe that these results reflect the fact that as marketing budgets are squeezed, targeted, measurable ads are becoming more valuable to advertisers. As consumer budgets are squeezed, people use the web for comparison shopping to hunt for bargains online and in stores.
Regarding the economic situation, I think everybody on the call and listening understands that it is pretty clear the economic situation today globally is worse than people were predicting just a month ago. So, look at the difference in the papers. What started off as a financial crisis appears at least according to the consensus around the world, to be affecting the wider economy.
When I talk to other CEOs in Europe and in America, it is clear that the economic situation is so fluid, that we are all in uncharted territory. The question is how should Google respond? Our answer, as always, is looking at the long-term, and we believe that even more today -- more important today than ever.
Search, which of course is Google's core, is where we are putting a lot of our investment -- better search, better ads, [proof latency]. Our user experience is getting much better. Index size is getting much larger, greater personalization for better results globally for every user, lots and lots of language support, more highly relevant ads against as many queries as possible and using more sophisticated tools for advanced bidding and measurement and optimization. So that advertisers, who understand that advertising is directly correlated with revenue, can use those tools to maximize revenue based on the terms that they set and based on the budgets, which is what they care about.
So the opportunities are more than just the search and ads.  In Apps, for example, the company is going to cut IT costs and increase productivity with greater collaboration well. We are there for them. Our enterprise applications really add value there. In display by improving targeting, we deliver better and more relevant ads for users and for advertisers, agencies and publishers.
The DoubleClick integration now going very well. David Rosenblatt from DoubleClick is now President of our display businesses, says it is going great. YouTube is now running 90% – ads against 90% of all the content claimed by partners using our content ID tool. We are experimenting with different advertising formats now well announced in video ads, click-to-buy and pre-roll.
Geo-Mobile another core component and new opportunity for us geographically relevant in location based advertising is valuable to users in our view, who are working, developing advertising products that match ads to geographic data. We think that is a big opportunity for us.
So along the way, we are going to stay very close, keep a very close eye on costs. It makes sense given everything we read in the papers and we have done that effectively in this quarter. It is the right thing to do and what I like about it. Sergey can talk about this a little bit if he likes. Sergey likes to say scarcity builds clarity. I think it is a great focusing opportunity for Google as well.
To a very realistic about the macro economic climate, but we are optimistic about Google's future because we are confident about the enduring value and power of the web. Sergey will talk about this in more, but fundamentally people are moving to the internet, they are moving to more targeted advertising, are using information in a smarter way and Google is one of the significant beneficiaries of that.
We fundamentally believe that users will always want information and need to communicate and advertisers will always value relevant and very measurable advertising, which of course these are Google's core strengths. So, with that Sergey maybe you would like to – sorry Patrick maybe you talk about our financials first and then we will go over to Sergey.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Eric and good afternoon everyone. So, as Eric said a few minutes ago, we had another solid quarter despite a challenging economic environment. A few numbers: gross revenue was up 31% year-over-year to $5.5 billion reflecting healthy growth across the Google - both Google.com and our network. Google.com was up 34% year-over-year to $3.7 billion driven by steady traffic growth and AdSense was up 15% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, also reflecting solid growth across both content and search.
Global aggregate paid click growth was also reasonably good goes up 18% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting healthy growth across all major properties. We saw also steady growth in the US with revenues up 22% year-over-year, to $2.7 billion and up 5% quarter-over-quarter.
International revenue also held up reasonably well, accounting for 51% of our total revenue or $2.8 billion. The UK showed some softness, but up 17% year-over-year to $776 million, but essentially flat quarter-over-quarter including the impact of the currency. The rest of EMEA performed better driven by relatively good performance in the Netherlands and Germany.
Asia and Latin America were solid as well, mostly driven by relatively good performance in Brazil and China.  From an advertisers’ spend perspective, we saw a combination of strong relative performance in many verticals including home appliances, apparels, jobs, but also and not surprisingly some tougher performances in others such as home financing, auto financing, and real estate as everybody can imagine.
Let me turn to expenses now to traffic acquisition costs were $1.5 billion in Q3 or 27.9% of total advertising revenue. This is down from $28.4 million in Q2. AdSense TAC was $1.3 billion and Google TAC was $167 million. As we embark on new initiatives, we may see additional pressures on TAC rates going forward.
Other costs of revenue they have increased $4 million over Q2 to $678 million and the largest driver of the increase was data center related costs and those include depreciation, equipment and operations. All other operating expenses totaled $1.63 billion, including approximately $269 million in stocks-based compensation and expenses related to payroll and facilities increased $49 million over Q2 to $859 million. 
On the headcount front, we finished a quarter with approximately 20,000 full-time employees. That is approximately 500 net new employees added in the quarter and over half of these new net hires are in engineering, and then followed by sales and marketing. We have implemented and continue to follow a disciplined hiring process in all areas of the organization, but as we have indicated in the past, we continue to invest in our core business, both in the US and internationally.
In consequence of all this management expense the non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock-based compensation, crossed the $2 billion threshold for the first time in Q3, driving non-GAAP operating profit margins to 36.5%. 
As Eric mentioned a little earlier in his comments, it makes sense on the current economic environment to maintain a clear focus on operational efficiency, and cost containment and we have done so, and we will continue to do so, better positioning Google for healthy long-term growth.
Let me move on to interest income and other, which was $21 million for the quarter. The primary driver for interest income, and other, are on the positive side, a very strong cash balance, $14.4 billion. The annual interest we earn on that cash is currently in the 2% to 3% range, and we also had a small realized gain on investment of $11 million in Q3. These benefits are to large extent offset by the impact of our, the rollout of our hedging program in Q3. So, in Q3, our hedging expense and related impacts totaled approximately $80 million.
Please note that we amortize the cost for the time value of our cash-flow hedging programs in other income and expense on a monthly mark-to-market basis, not a straight line basis. As a result, the amount of amortized expense were recognized in any particular quarter is impacted by how much the option moves in or out of the money, as well as the underlying currency volatility.
So, in particularly volatile periods, like the ones we are experiencing now, this can result in a front-end loading of expenses associated with the outstanding hedges, as was in fact the case in Q3. So clearly, currency was working against us in this quarter, but on the good news, our hedging programs are in fact working well. So, a bit more on the hedging program, our FX program should be viewed essentially as an insurance policy. Our programs are designated to protect us against future downside risk to revenue and earnings, reported in US dollars.
Our largest currency exposures are the euro, the Canadian dollar and the British pound, and are now hedged and over the coming year. We will rollout incremental hedges to cover much of the remaining exposure. So, how does the accounting for all these hedging works? It is FAS 133, which is the standard in US accounting and we use FAS 133 to account for our cash flow hedging programs.
FAS 133 is not a simple standard this by any means. So, it is well worth a time, to take the time to understand the basics and I encourage you to do so. We walk through some of those basics of FAS 133 in our earnings slides deck, which I encourage you to reference. It is posted as Krista mentioned on our Investors Relations site. For the impact on Q3 before hedging, the recent strength of the US dollar relative to other currencies had a negative impact of $59 million on revenues in Q3.
We were able to recognize as a benefit of approximately $34 million to revenues through the cash flow hedging this quarter. So, to understand why our hedging does not offset a 100% of the negative impact of currency on revenue,  it is important to remember three key factors.
First, our cash flow hedges are designed to protect against a downside risk to earnings not revenue. Secondly, our Q3 hedges were made against three major currencies, the Euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar, but not all currencies. Finally, our pound hedges were put late in the quarter.
So, with that let me return to our financial results. I am pleased to report that operating cash flow remain strong at $2.18 billion for the quarter, CapEx for the quarter was $452 million. We have invested very heavily in our data centers and are continuing to do so. As in previous quarters, the majority of our CapEx was related to IT infrastructure including data center construction, production of servers and networking equipment.
Because of economies of scale, however, as well as greater efficiencies in our system infrastructure and in some ways Moore's Law, we can actually do a lot more today with less, which is a positive trend for us. That said, we will certainly continue to make significant investments in CapEx in future periods.
Finally, free cash flow. A non-GAAP measure, we define the free cash flow from operation less CapEx. It remains strong at $1.73 billion, up 61% year-over-year. So, in summary, our core business continues to demonstrate strength, despite a challenging economic environment, while we are focused on operational efficiency, we have and will continue to make crucial investments that are needed to drive value for our users, our advertisers and our partners. Before I hand it off to Sergey, I would like to take a moment to share with you some of my early thoughts on joining Google. So, I thank Eric for the kind words at the front end of the conversation.
First, let me say that I am delighted to be here and to join this company. This is obviously a great team I am joining, and everything you hear is true. These are super smart people, tremendous integrity, positively ambitious for the company and without a doubt our great winning combination. It is a great time to join Google and it is a real pleasure for me.
Yes, the financial and economic environment is going through a lot of uncertainty, but with great uncertainty also comes tremendous opportunity. I look forward for leveraging my financial and operational background to take advantage of the tremendous opportunity in front of us and lead with the team the company into the next phase of growth.
With that, I would like to thank you for the time and I will turn it over to Sergey for his thoughts on the quarter. Thank you.
Sergey Brin
Thanks, Patrick. I would like to update you this quarter on many different improvements, we made across the board. Let me start with our infrastructure and I am talking about both the hardware and software infrastructure, the powers all of our services.
First of all, this quarter we significantly increased the size of our index. To put this in perspective now, every four hours we index the same amount of information that is equivalent to the entire US Library of Congress. I would encourage you, by the way, how can you see this? I encourage you to search for information that might not have that many references about on the web, whether it is a neighbor or local place, something like that, and just to see how much more information we have been able to put on the index.
We have also worked a lot on our performance. Particularly, we had a lot of improvements in search, especially if you use the Google toolbar, which I encourage you to do. In YouTube and also many of our Apps, especially Calendar. Hopefully you will see the improvements as snappier performance, when you come back and use these services now.
We have also been working on our overall efficiency from an energy point of view and I should report that our data centers now use several times less energy than typical facilities that would house and cool the same number of computers that we would have.
Next moving on, Search of course remains core to our business, and now for the second quarter in a row we have launched over 100 search improvements during the quarter, so more than one per day. This is obviously improved things for our users all around the world. Very important feature, Google suggests that we have had available in a variety of different interfaces and now is on Google.com is running in ten countries. This actually really helps users and speeds them up much more than you might expect. As you are typing a query, we will fill out what is likely the query that you might want, spelled correctly and it really significantly speeds the overall search process.
We also have continue to take our other corpuses that are not just web pages, things such as books and videos, and we continue to blend more and more of those into the first page of results, across all of our domains. The numbers of these blended results has increased significantly over the past quarter. I would encourage you to try searching, for example, for Michael Phelps. You will see video of swimming and whatnot.
This also is very powerful, especially when you look at video, because people think of video as entertainment, but in fact video is a very compelling reference material. It is a really good way to learn something, to really understand it. Oftentimes you will not actually think to search for video. So, for us to present it in the first page of results means people are going to get much higher quality information about what they are looking for than they otherwise would have.
On the business front of course, advertising remains the vast majority of our revenue. We continued to improve our ad systems. We have updated our quality based bidding system, which helps weed out underperforming ads and gives us the opportunity to run better ads, and generate a better return on investment for advertisers.
We have also made some changes to how we rate landing pages in terms of quality and we really want to make sure that when our users click on ads, they are taken to useful sites. That way, people are encouraged to click on ads in the future.
In fact, on the whole, I should mention that our ads add a significant amount of high quality material to our search and we believe it they overall increase our overall search quality experience. We have also been working hard of course, on display ads as Eric mentioned with David Rosenblatt now heading that entire operation, now with DoubleClick integrated, and the various properties that we have with potential display inventory.  We are really moving along and we have made about two dozen improvements to our content network over this past quarter. Just last week, we launched a new category, AdSense for games. Over 200 million people play web-based games every week. Our network already reaches almost 10% of them, just at launch. So, we are very excited about that.
Speaking of display inventory, I just want to talk a little bit about YouTube.  They have been experimenting with a number of monetization methods. We have now, the click-to-buy feature that you might have seen, where now if you watch a YouTube video that is either could be a user uploaded video or uploaded by, for example, a studio and now people can just click-to-buy either CD or a video or other content that is similar to that video and this is obviously a benefit to both end users as well as the publishers and presents a great monetization opportunity.
I should also mention that we have launched full length videos from CBS within stream ads and that means they can be pre-roll, mid-roll and post-roll. These full length videos really take you to another level of offering completely different kind of video than one would typically expect on that site.
We have also been investing a lot in geographic and local information and I am sure many or all of you have used Google Maps and Google Earth. They are really big monetization opportunity because they are such a local searches and there are many local businesses. Now we have been able to expand just a data available there, so we can provide a better end user experience by launching Map Maker to over 100 additional countries. This is our product of lets end users create and edit the maps for their own countries and regions and by doing so the users have already added over 50,000 kilometers of roads and 75,000 business listings.
I should mention that an increasing percentage of our local search queries now deliver user generated maps content. We have launched Street View in Japan and Australia, and we saw significant increases in usage there. Of course free tune as now available on BlackBerries, and many Java enabled phones in addition to the other phones that already had it. It can be pretty handy, you know, when you do a search for now business or store, restaurants something like that, you can just click on the Street View and see what it actually looks like and make sure that is the place you want to go.
As I mentioned before, now with the ability to do that on phones, it is very handy. Now speaking of phones, we of course had a very important announcement this past quarter, which is our new Android operating system and which is launching first on the T-Mobile G1. You can get these phones starting next week and at your T-Mobile store. I have been using mine for a few months now as my primary phone and it is been very helpful. It really integrates the Google services very nicely on the phone, it has really great web browser.
You know, I am able to search and brows through my Gmail just as if I was at my desk top. The G1 is just the first of a number of phones that will hopefully be running Android. You should take note of all of the partners we have built in the open handset alliance. I would encourage you all to try it out and if it suits your need then please, by all means, get an Android phone.
Moving on, we have been busy at work as Eric mentioned on Enterprise. Now we have over 1 million businesses using Google Apps. In fact, we have launched Google Video for your business as part of our Apps premiere edition.
Now you may think of video like YouTube this basically for your business a last thing that might be needed in a business. In fact we have had great demand for it. Internally we use video quite a bit. We have so many internal talks that we are able to record and then the people, who miss it, can just watch it online. We have had just a great amount of demand by businesses for this. I think this will be a very compelling feature to our Google Apps product.
In addition to businesses, Google Apps are increasingly being adopted by universities. Now over a million students use Google Apps just a couple of years after the launch, and we have had dozens of universities and colleges deploy Apps since the New Year just started including Indiana University, University of Virginia, George Washington, and many others.
Now lastly, I wanted to tell you something I am really excited about. I am sure many of you saw, it is a launch of Google Chrome, which is our new web browser. As you know, we created a lot of web services, and an increasing challenge to us is to have a robust enough platform to be able to run those web services quickly, and reliably. Chrome does both of those things. It has incredibly fast JavaScript engine, which we are really excited about called V8. 
In addition, it has a process model that is much more robust. Now, if you have a problem with one tab in your browser, you can just kill that tab and your browser just keeps running just fine, whereas in the past, number of browsers if you had one tab hang you could hang the entire browser.
We are continuing to improve it and we have opened sourced it entirely. So, not just Google, but the whole community is improving Chrome. We hope that it obviously continues to improve Chrome, but also it raises the bar for all browsers because we want all the web platforms out there more capable so we can more easily deploy our services.
All in all, it is been a very busy quarter at Google. We have had so many announcements, launches, so many improvements; it is really hard to keep track. I appreciate all of you following it. Thank you and talk to you next quarter.
Eric Schmidt
Well, thank you very much, Sergey. You are going to stay for the Q&A for a few minutes, too.
Sergey Brin
No problem.
Eric Schmidt
Thank you Patrick as well. We will have Hal, Jonathan, and Omid join us and maybe we would move to questions Krista.
Krista Bessinger
Yes, we are ready do queue up for questions, operator.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Imran Khan from JPMorgan.
Imran Khan - JPMorgan
Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. Question about the economy and what the trend you are seeing.  I think Eric, you talked about that the economy seems like weakening over the last four weeks or, so that I have been hearing the same thing. Can you give us some color like how is your business trend, July, August, versus September? Did you see the business weakening significantly in the month of September or if you can give us some color regarding what trends you are seeing in October?
The second question is regarding the network revenue. Excluding TAC, it seems like network revenue growth rate decelerated quite a bit.  I  just try to understand that better, thank you.
Eric Schmidt
Thanks, Imran. I am going ask Hal to help me here. We see fluctuations and they are more complex than they may appear; some things go up, some things go down. Obviously, it is going to change as the global financial crisis moves through. It also varies by country and by region. Hal?
Hal Varian
Yes, I think I can give you a little color on some of the things that are being going on. As you know we do not give guidance with respect to our internal numbers, but we have a nice tool out there called Search Insights; we can take the pulse of the consumer. If you look in the last several weeks, there has been this almost obsession with financial markets. Huge increases in inquiries on money market, mutual funds, buy gold, 401(k)s, banking crisis, LIBOR, home safes. So right now, I think it is very difficult to really extrapolate from the current period where you have got this major event going on, really a once in a lifetime event. Let's all hope it it is once in a lifetime. So, it is very hard to tell what things are going to look like going forward basis.
Eric Schmidt
Jonathan, do you have a view on this?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Just very quickly on the second question which I did not think Hal got to the network deceleration. , Imran, there are really two things that you want to look at. Some of it is a function of quality efforts, and the other is basically a function of deal flow in the large partners that we have that are participating. So, those are the two things that you need to look at. Our landing page quality which Sergey mentioned in his introductory remarks relates to the quality issues.
Imran Khan - JPMorgan
Got it. Thank you. Hal, I agree with that and hope it is a one-time event of our lifetime.
Eric Schmidt
Our next question?
Operator
We will go next to Mark Mahaney from Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citi
Thanks. I wanted to ask two questions please. First has to do with the thoughts on cost, Eric. You talked about being needing to be more cognizant of cost structure in a deteriorating economic environment, and what is going to be a severe recession. Does that mean you cut back on just on operating costs, or would there be a point where you would actually delay materially major investment priorities like mobile?
Then a quick question to Sergey. Could you just talk broadly about what in display advertising you think can be fixed, or what are the major innovations that could be brought to display advertising that we have not seen before? When you look at that, what do you see that Google could bring to that market? Thank you.
Eric Schmidt
Mark, on the question of investments, Google has shown courage, when we need to. We also intend during this period to show very responsible management of our expenses. Patrick, do you want to talk a little bit about how you are structuring this?
Patrick Pichette
Sorry, I got off mute. Yes, absolutely. I mean in these uncertain economic environments, and I think that we have seen it through to Q3 results. I think that the company is very responsible in managing its cost base to make sure that we are adapting to the environment in which we are operating.
So, operational efficiencies and cost containment have been in place for couple of quarters already and they continue to do so. So, we are adapting. We are very nimble and very agile in this and we will continue to be.
Regarding the second question that you have asked. Strategic investments are strategic investments and those you separate them from day-to-day operations, and every time we have a great opportunity, we are going to jump on it and as I said in my comments, the basics of CapEx infrastructures and the fundamental infrastructure for the company we are not going to stop. So, that is the balance we are striving.
Eric Schmidt

Sergey, the second part of the question.
Sergey Brin
Yes, on display; I think there are certainly a lot of opportunities in display, and let's just not forget when we first got started with AdWords or the predecessors to AdWords, it took us a number of years for those things to even catch up to what then was the big dollar numbers of the display advertising and finally to show the incredible power for both advertisers and end users of search-based advertising. So I think we could see the same thing with display where it actually takes actually while to mature with the new model.
One of the things what I think is very valuable for display, even though it might be more brand focused, you still really care about targeting and showing the right ads to the right end users at the right times and try to show them things they might be interested in. You might want to have a return, not be a click necessarily but just be the branding and having generating awareness. Nonetheless, you really want to reach the right people. 
Now another part of that is we have great measurement tools. You know what happens after people might see an ad and how might they act differently.  We also have access now to a vast variety of inventory ranging from our AdSense network to a variety of our DoubleClick technologies. This can give you access to more inventory and finally, our properties such as YouTube and Orkut.
So we still see this as an area that is ripe for development and innovation and we think that we can continue to create great tools for display. This includes, by the way, things like not just – we are not just talking about banner ads on web pages, includes AdSense for games as I mentioned earlier, it includes feeds, it includes video like YouTube and other sites. So, it is a big opportunity.
Eric Schmidt
Let's go to our next question.
Operator
We will take our next question from Brian Pitz from Banc of America Securities.
Brian Pitz - Banc of America Securities
Thank you. You announced three changes relatively recently in particular replacing minimum with first page bids I think late in Q3. Would you talk about the early impact these changes are having on the auction process? Thanks.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes, sure. This is Jonathan. That particular quality-based bidding effort I think was launched around the first week of September. Basically, the impact that that has is the quality score is calculated real-time on each query. So, what was happening previously was that keywords were inactive and not available based on the quality dynamic. What is happening now is there are keywords that are able to participate in every auction because we are calculating it real-time. So, it is basically allowing us to get what were previously in active keywords to compete in the auction more successfully based on the real-time calculation. That is pretty much it.
Brian Pitz - Banc of America Securities
Any major impact so far that you are seeing as a – how long will it take to really work its way through?
Jonathan Rosenberg
As far as the quality announcements that we typically talk about, it is certainly one of the bigger things we did in the quarter and typically these things tend to manifest themselves in terms of their impact reasonably, expeditiously after the launch. So, I think that most of the benefit of the typical quality enhancements is real very quickly.
Eric Schmidt
If you want to remind everybody that we make very – we commonly make 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 quality improvements in a quarter, these are just some of the better known ones. We are constantly tuning based on our quality testing and again globally as well.
Brian Pitz - Banc of America Securities
Great, thanks.
Eric Schmidt
Our next question?
Operator
We will go next to Christa Quarles from Thomas Weisel Partners.
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
Hi. My question is really related to the Yahoo! deal. Eric, were you surprised by the vitriol in the response from the advertisers out there? Clearly there is reality in how this thing functions versus perception.  I would be curious how are you approaching the government meddling in your ability to function and operate and how are you responding as it relates to the Yahoo - Google arrangement?
Eric Schmidt
Well, Christa, thank you. I will let you used the phrase meddling and I am not going to be using that phrase. When we did the deal, we understood that the deal would be both controversial that our competitors would oppose it, and they would oppose it using every tactic that they could and also that there was a proper role for the legal review process. So, we anticipated were turned out to be roughly four-month delay. Literally to give everybody time to talk about it. We are hopefully during the end of that period and we are obviously in communications with the Justice Department and the other groups that are doing it.
With respect to the advertiser reaction, we have seen a balance of reactions. We have seen some large advertisers, complain. We have seen other large advertisers say that this is ultimately good for our businesses. I obviously have a bias on this question and in my view many of the complaints are based on the fact that people do not understand how the auctions really work and the benefits that auctions provide.
Auctions provide really a clearing price for accurate value and because the prices in our auction are largely set by people, who can back-solve to the cost per acquisition. The cost-per-click and the revenue that we get is largely tied all together. Hal in fact wrote a blog post yesterday precisely on this issue because there has been so much confusion about it. Hal, do you want to comment on that?
Hal Varian
Sure. We have been making a concerted effort to try to educate people more about how our model works. One thing we were bit surprised in is even people, who had been using AdWords did not necessarily understand how and why functions the way it does, so we are really trying across the Board to communicate better with all the sectors that we serve.
Eric Schmidt
So, next question.
Operator
We will go next to Ben Schachter from UBS.
Ben Schachter - UBS
Congratulations on a nice quarter.
Eric Schmidt
Yes. Thanks Ben.
Ben Schachter - UBS
In order for the display strategy to work, do you think you need to offer more inventory on your own sites or can it become meaningful just through better penetration of the AdSense network. Also on Google Checkout in the past there have been a lot of discussion around the badges and how they have increased click through rates and conversions. Seems there is less of an emphasis on that product. Does it make sense to potentially work with PayPal on moving forward.
Then one last house keeping one. If you look at depreciation and cost of goods less TAC they seem to be flat quarter-over-quarter, which is never happened before. Any comments on that? Thanks.
Eric Schmidt
So, you asked three questions and so Patrick you will do the third one. Omid can you and thanks Ben for that. Can you talk a little bit about display and Checkout?
Omid Kordestani
Sure. Ben I am calling from London so please let me know if the voice is not getting through correctly. As far as we mentioned earlier we put a concerted effort across all the regions in our product teams and brought Dave Rosenblatt into the position with his vast experience from DoubleClick to help us really pieces all together, and bring a great focus in our execution.
Simply, our objective here is that we want to marry the art of display, which is the engagement it offers with the science of search advertising relevancy and measurability. We have a lot of inventory, great inventory both across our Content Network already and across YouTube and that our goal really is to focus both on the advertisers and publishers here for advertisers, really scaling the advertising process for media planning, buying, selling, all the way to optimization and for publishers helping with increasing the yield, and that they are experiencing.
We have great, great headways already in Q3. We had NBCOlympics.com using DoubleClick serving ads over 30 million unique users. In Europe, they use the platform very effectively to increase the number of transactions and reduce the cost per transaction by 33%. So, this measurability and reach is already very effective across our network and our existing properties. As Sergey mentioned a long-term focus for us to get all the pieces together and execute and grow the business.
As far as Checkout goes, I think again, we continue to evaluate what is the best ways to focus and utilize the existing headway we have made. There is really nothing, really new to announce here other than we are considering how best to apply the service, going forward. We are open to all kinds of options and we will evaluate it as and we see the results.
Eric Schmidt
Patrick, do you want to handle the last question?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, I would just like a clarification. You said about D&A specifically or is it OpEx excluding D&A and TAC that was a question?
Ben Schachter - UBS
No, I was really looking at the depreciation and looking at the cost of goods less the TAC. If you look at those excluding stock and they are both flat quarter-over-quarter and that has never happened.
Patrick Pichette
Yes, what we have done is in the first part of the year, we had been accelerated some depreciation amortization in the bunch of equipment now is flow through. That is really the core driver of that.
Ben Schachter - UBS
Thanks.
Eric Schmidt
Okay, thanks. Next question?
Operator
We will go next to Doug Anmuth from Barclays Capital.
Doug Anmuth - Barclays Capital
Thanks for taking my question. First one for Sergey, you made some comments last quarter indicating the coverage may have dipped too low. Can you talk about what you did with coverage during 3Q and a little bit on your updated view on that?
A second one for Hal, can you just talk about how advertisers are changing their behavior and strategy in terms of keyword bidding in this environment, and what is happening with average cost-per-click and what is happening with ROIs as well. Thank you.
Hal Varian
Sure. Hi, Doug, I can start briefly on coverage and maybe Sergey can follow-up. I think one of the things that we have probably done a better job in the last year or so, is we have done a much better job of eliminating the bad ads than we have introducing functionality that makes it particularly easy to enable, good ads. This is not really a dial that we just want to turn. We have a very clear goal, which is to show as many high relevant ads against queries as possible and there are lots and lots of queries still out there that we can do better on.
We have a good list of those, particularly complicated long queries, or queries that have very diverse meaning. Queries with modifiers, for example if you look on 'Wee Games', we have ads. However, if you type in 'best Wee Games', we do not. Your plumber is not on AdWords. So, the goal is not really too explicitly we try to figure out how we get coverage up. The goal is to figure out how we add the bidding functionality, so that advertisers can serve better ads. If you are actually looking at your components of the RPM equation, which we do not really break out much. Generally you are seeing what we have said in the past, which is the coverage is in the ballpark of the historic lows.
Jonathan Rosenberg

With respect to the advertiser behavioral side, people focus on this aggregate cost-per-click measure. As we have said before, it is misleading, because it is aggregating across the entire world, and it is aggregating across AdWords and AdSense So relatively small changes in the mix can show up in that number. We do not really think it reflects the actual advertiser behavior, in a very clear way.
Our experience is advertisers are willing to take all the clicks we can give them at the current CPC, and even in tough times. We think that will continue to be true because nobody wants to turn away a customer. So, we think that is actually a pretty solid number and will continue to be so and thank you.
Sergey Brin
Yes. This is Sergey. You are exactly right, that is what I know in the last quarter. I should mention that we have made progress. For example the quality-based bidding launch that we talked about earlier increased our coverage significantly and fundamentally as Jonathan says look at page of our web search results. I think we are far from the ideal set of advertisements and there are many advertisers that I think ought to be showing up certain situations that that are not for variety of reasons. So, I think there is certainly opportunity to give end users better higher quality, advertisers they are going to add their overall search quality experience.
Eric Schmidt
Okay. Thank you. Thanks Sergey. Next question?
Operator
We will go next to Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thanks. Now you have had a bunch of mobile phone launches. I am wondering if you can give us an update on what you are seeing on the query volumes and maybe an estimate on when that could be maybe 5% of your total volumes and then on the currency I think you said it cost you $80 million in the quarter. Is that one time as you established the hedges or this is ongoing thing that could last a few more quarters?
Eric Schmidt
This is Eric. We said publicly for the last few months that we are seeing an explosion in mobile search volume. It is a lot of it has been enabled by the fact that these new sets of devices have much more powerful browsers. So, they are on 3G or E-Video networks and they have more powerful browsers and people are busy browsing. You know just an amazing amount of time. We do not show the exact numbers, but I can tell you that the compound growth rate is one of the fastest growing things in the company.
Patrick, you want to answer the second part?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, the $80 million was – in both Q2 and Q3 because we have launched these programs and put them in place, they are much higher than what you can expect in the future. In fact, we have got the 18-month programs mostly in place for the three big currencies I talked about and now we are going to be in maintenance mode. So, from that perspective it will be less.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
If the US dollar keeps appreciating will you continue to see a revenue benefit.
Patrick Pichette
As you put hedges over the long-term, yes, the answer is yes.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Eric Schmidt
You are assuming it will or will not. So, we never know. I will say, yes, we never know, whether currency is going to go up or down. Let's move to our next question.
Operator
We will go next to Ross Sandler from RBC Capital Markets.
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks for taking my question, just two quick questions. First on the retail category, so eBay painted a pretty disastrous picture for ecommerce and the consumer in general last night, stating that there was a meaningful slowdown in activity beginning in August and deteriorating in the mid-October.
Clearly that company is having some specific issues, but you did not mention retail as a category of weakness in your prepared remarks and judging by your numbers, especially in the US that would suggest that you are pretty well diversified.
So, can you comment on the current trends in the retail category and then second on the UK?, Google changed its policy on bidding on gambling keywords this morning and it appears that those ads go live tomorrow. So, unlike prior policy changes this one was delivered with a little advanced notice, agencies got the criteria this morning, and campaigns go live right away. So, any reason for the quick rollout there? Thanks very much.
Eric Schmidt
Thank you. We will have Omid, since he is in London, he will answer the second question. The first question, we have looked at what we think will happen in the next few quarters. The problem is, there is so much uncertainty now in the financial markets, in the press, and in potential government action, and so forth.
It is very hard for us to give you a sense of what is going to happen in retail or any category between now and the Christmas season or over the next 12 months or so forth. Hal, you have looked at the various categories, if you want to can you give some macro comments about categories for us?
Hal Varian
Well, when you look at the US aggregate statistics, we definitely saw weakness in US offline retail the numbers that are reported by the government. One thing that we think at Google is that when there is a recessionary environment, people are counting their pennies, they are going to be researching their purchases, looking for bargains, and this potentially has something of an upside for Google. We referred to this last time I called it the Wal-Mart effect that as people shop more carefully they are going to be researching the things they buy. So as Eric said, we do not really know what is going to happen. This is a speculative statement but we think that this effect could actually work to Google's benefit potentially.
Eric Schmidt
Omid, do you want to comment on the UK.
Omid Kordestani
Sure. I think to be honest with you, this is one of the benefits we have now of much tighter attention to every aspect of our international operations. We now have both Nikesh, our Head of EMEA and Tim Armstrong, Head of Americas attending our executives meetings, and they are frankly upset of policies and questions that the market had put on us, and we really are being much more responsive to these things to our sales organization and change these policies, very quickly to address to the market demands. So, I think you – we will definitely work with our agency partners and customers to make the transition as smooth as possible.
Eric Schmidt
Thanks. So our next question?
Operator
We will go next to Jeffrey Lindsay from Sanford Bernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford Bernstein
Hello and thanks for taking my question. We just wanted to talk a little bit clarification on the improvement in margins. Was this due in any way to improved terms on the AdSense deals or was it primarily expense control? If it was expense control was that really through avoided hiring or was there actually any staff reduction? Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
I can answer on the expense side. Across all categories of expenses, people have been very diligent over the last 90 days and I can – and on the specifics of hiring, I mean, we have continued to hire. We just hire in many areas. We are continuing to hire because we have a lot of needs and then what we are doing is just doing responsibly. So there – we will continue to hire, that is why you see the net improvement in headcount but it is truly broadly across all categories of expenses that we are focusing let it be AdSense, it covers it.
Eric Schmidt
I am not aware of changes that would – on the ad or ad partnership side that would result in margin change. Omid?
Omid Kordestani
No.
Eric Schmidt
Okay. The next question?
Operator
We will take our next question from Youssef Squali from Jefferies.
Youssef Squali - Jefferies
Hi, thank you very much. Two quick ones; first on CapEx, if I look at CapEx this quarter, so $450 million was the lowest we have seen since Q1 of 2006. Are we at a point, well, basically the bulk of the infrastructure is already built and now any incremental is all that much smaller. Is CapEx starting to normalize?
Second, a question for Sergey. You talked earlier about GeoLocal with product like Maps and Earth is big monetization opportunity, so we have talked about them for a long time and they remain opportunities. One of the issues there has been this direct access to the advertisers to the local merchant. Have you – are we any – are we closer to cracking the code on that?
Eric Schmidt
Patrick, do you want to give a sense of CapEx?
Patrick Pichette
Yes, with pleasure. I mean essentially, CapEx is a lumpy business in many instances. So think of data centers going up and down I mean one quarter you have it, one quarter you do not, so we are going to continue to invest in CapEx, we are going to continue to invest heavily in CapEx, so we have no plans of slowing down. What you see here is just a nature of that lumpiness. We are obviously getting better at it, so with efficiencies every extra unit of capacity is cheaper for us, so we are going to benefit back.
Youssef Squali - Jefferies
Were there any costs pushed out into CapEx into Q4?
Patrick Pichette
No, none.
Youssef Squali - Jefferies
Okay.
Eric Schmidt
Sergey and maybe Jonathan you want to have a look about the GeoLocal ad opportunities?
Sergey Brin
Yes, let me talk about it. Certainly GeoLocal has been a substantial source of investments on the part of our company and you are absolutely right. I think it is a really big monetization opportunity but it is going to have a pretty long bootstrap time because there are so many small businesses and you have to get them all in the loop.
Technology is evolving quickly with respect to things shifting to mobile phones and some of them will have GPS now, some of them do not, some have cell ID different device and things. I do think that this is an investment that we are going to have to keep investing in for some time till we get really big payoff.
I should mention we already have fairly substantial revenues from geo local, so it is not the case but somehow this is I mean this is a good chunk of our business and I expect that when we do finally bootstrap lots and lots of local advertisers. When there is some settling of the best user experiences for doing this both on mobile devices as well as on the desktops, I think you will see a substantial ramp there.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Eric, do you want me to add anything. Yes? This is Jonathan. The biggest thing I would reinforce from Sergey's comments is, this is an area where we are winning. Maps is the most popular mapping site in the world. We have got all sorts of data now for over 160 countries. We are also doing some very exciting things in terms of ramping our ability to get data for areas where there are not very good maps, where we are harnessing the power of users to enter information in.
On the local side, what we are doing really goes beyond the traditional Yellow Page types of activities and I mean we are taking all the information that a business would want or a user to see; reviews, hours of operations, photos, web results, and we are embedding all of those on to these maps which have a great deal of traffic. So, if you just run a query, steakhouse in Chicago or something like that and when you click on the map and select a particular listing, you can now do things like click on Street View and actually see the restaurant. So we are very pleased with the traffic that is being driven.
One other thing I would actually suggest you try one of the coolest maps applications I saw. Go to swisstrains.ch to see the precision of Swiss trains in real-time and you will actually get a visceral sense of what it is going to be like for people when all of this stuff works on their browsers and works in mobile devices.
Eric Schmidt
Let’s go ahead and Krista I think we – this is – we are sure of running out of time, maybe this should be our last question.
Krista Bessinger
Yes, this is our last question. Please. 
Operator
Our last question comes from Jeetil Patel from Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Great, thank you. Just one last question; on your AdSense syndication network, can you talk about the rollout of the quality score initiative? Is it still at first half '09 rollout or perhaps a little longer and have you learned anything around the testing that you are doing there or still tweaking that? Thanks.
Eric Schmidt
So, again, you are using the word quality score. Could you just be precisely define what you mean?
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
The scoring index you are looking at for your syndication network, so rating each partner out there; just curious how that –how that initiative or program that you are looking at launching is progressing?
Eric Schmidt
It is actually in the process of being launched. A number of partners already working with it and the plan is to get it done in early next year. Yes, so and obviously we spent a lot of time with them to make sure that their sites are done properly, our system responds properly to their query traffic and so forth.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank
Got it. How often will the scoring system change? Will it be real-time or will it take a month at a time or quarter at a time?
Eric Schmidt
We tend to be very dynamic because these systems have feedback in them. So, as they learn, they get better at judging, what is a higher quality click and as they learn they get better and better and that is why such a nice model.
Sergey Brin
This is Sergey. Probably I think we have had this system in place for AdSense for Content for a long, long time. Now it is the extension of that into AdSense for search. These are obviously some of our larger customers that have significant implementations and we are taking our time to roll it out in a way that is have sensible for both us and them. This is something that we have been doing for a long time within AdSense for Content, now that will be applied more broadly.
Eric Schmidt
So, why don't we go ahead and just finish up? I want to thank everybody for spending time. Everybody is very busy with all the things going on around the world. Thank you for our panelists and our call in today. From my perspective, there is an awful lot of stuff going on in the world, there is an awful lot of actions that we hope will be taken correctly by governments around the world, by the bankers and by the institutions that are there to make sure our systems run well.
We have a duty and responsibility to run Google well. We take a long term view. We have the opportunity before us and we have the time and the patience to build a great future which is what we hope will happen for everybody. So thank you very much.

Welcome, everyone to the Google Inc. conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Krista Bessinger, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Krista Bessinger
Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to today’s Q2 2008 earnings conference call. We have a slightly different line-up today. With us are Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer; George Reyes, Chief Financial Officer; Sergey Brin, Founder and President of Technology; Jonathan Rosenberg, SVP of Product Management; Omid Kordestani, SVP of Global Sales and Operations; and Hal Varian, Chief Economist. Eric, George, Hal and Sergey will provide us with their thoughts on the quarter and then Jonathan and Omid will join us for Q&A.
Please note that this call is being webcast from our investor relations website and our press release, issued a few minutes ago, is also posted on the website along with slides that accompany today’s prepared remarks. A replay of this call will also be available on our investor relations website in a few hours.
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding investments in our core business; seasonality; traffic acquisition costs; increases in the cost of sales; international growth; statements regarding the benefits of our acquisition of DoubleClick; and our expected level of capital expenditures. 
These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
Please refer to our SEC filings including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 as well as our earnings press release for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the investor relations section of our website.
Also, please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call such as EPS, net income, operating margin and operating income are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Schmidt
Thank you very much, Krista. We’re obviously very pleased with what we believe are good results in one of the weaker quarters in our normal yearly cycle. The traffic and revenue growth was strong across all regions and verticals. Traffic and revenue have held up well despite uncertain economic conditions, as everybody knows. 
International, of course, a big emphasis where Google is once again contributing more than 50% of our revenue; good growth in rapidly growing markets such as Brazil and China.
We continue, of course, to make critical and fundamental investments in the infrastructure of the things that are most important, and in particular, search. We continue to scale our index; we continue to make sure that our information is the freshest possible and we are reducing latency or delays that people experience. So as a result, we are continuing to deliver on our fundamental mission of the most relevant and fastest results of web and other kind of information.
In ads, in addition to all of the normal ad improvements that we see, the partnership with Yahoo! was obviously the signature event. David Drummond testified two days ago, both for the House and Senate. I liked it so much I wanted to read it. 
The internet is a dynamic and competitive environment and that is due to the openness that has been a hallmark since its inception. Our non-exclusive commercial agreement – that is very important, by the way, non-exclusive -- with Yahoo! will maintain and expand that competition. It creates new efficiencies that will benefit consumers, advertisers and publishers as well as protecting privacy and spurring innovation.
Google and Yahoo! will remain fierce competitors. This continuing competition will help fuel innovation that is good for the internet, users; good for the internet, good for the economy. Openness, interoperability and competition are central to our culture at Google, central to the vibrancy of the internet and central to the growth of a free market.
We believe that the non-exclusive ad deal – remember it is not a search deal -- that was done with Yahoo! is a win for the industry primarily because it allows Yahoo! to remain independent, which we believe is very pro-competitive. 
DoubleClick of course, is the other big piece of news. Integration is now underway and going very smoothly, with display as a big opportunity. And big opportunity, by the way, because the strategy of offering value to advertisers and publishers is one that we can offer very much worldwide.
Putting our team together, of course, we've really now delivered on this global organization that everybody here knows about, and it is beginning to bear fruit. [Angalore] for example, developed some great new ad tools that were delivered last quarter; [Zurich] created our new Insight feature on YouTube which lets anyone who uploads videos see traffic information. [Hifa] developed another great new YouTube feature called Imitations. 
My point here is not to highlight the hundreds and hundreds of ones that happen all the time, every quarter, but to say it really is a global company. So we now have more than 30 products that support more than 30 languages, up from five products and 30 languages just a year ago. So people want to use Google in their own language and we are delivering on that.
Just to finish up my hopefully short comments, we are very, very happy to have Patrick Pichette on board as our new CFO with 20 years experience in financial operations and management in the telco industry. I've talked to him; he is coming up to speed. He is going to be a tremendous contributor at Google for many years to come. I am very, very excited about that.
I want to make sure that we thank once again George Reyes, my friend and colleague for more than 20 years.  George stayed on board even more than a year after he announced his intent to retire. This shows you the kind of person that he is, to try to help Google and to help all of us meet our objectives. He has made a tremendous contribution to Google, which we have highlighted before. We are going to miss him, and we are very much looking forward to working with Patrick.
In our order today we are going to have George, who I have just highlighted, if I can boast about him some more without making him too embarrassed; and then we will have him followed by Hal Varian. Larry is out this week.  Hal is our Chief Economist and there have been so many questions about Yahoo!/Google economics and so forth. Hal is the perfect person to talk about how does the auction really work and what does the global environment mean for Google?
George, do you want to take it away?
George Reyes
We had another strong quarter, with gross revenue increasing 39% over Q2 of 2007 to $5.4 billion. Google.com performed well, up 42% year over year to $3.5 billion, driven by strong traffic growth and to a lesser extent, monetization. 
AdSense revenue grew 22% over Q2 of 2007 but was down slightly on a sequential basis, reflecting a continued focus on delivering high quality traffic to our advertisers and typical Q2 seasonality. 
Now let’s take a look at aggregate paid clicks. Aggregate paid clicks include clicks related to ads served on Google properties, as well as ads served on our partner sites. Aggregate paid clicks grew approximately 19% over Q2 of 2007 and were down slightly on a sequential basis, again reflecting a continued focus on delivering high quality traffic to our advertisers and typical Q2 seasonality. 
Now I’ll discuss our international performance. International revenue accounted for 52% of revenue, or $2.8 billion. The UK was solid with revenues of $774 million, up 29% year over year but down 4% sequentially, reflecting typical Q2 seasonality and negligible FX impact.
Revenue growth in EMEA was strong, primarily driven by strong performance in Benelux, Ireland and parts of Western Continental Europe including Germany, France, Spain and Italy, fueled by relatively strong performance in automotive and consumer packaged goods. Asia and Latin America continue to show impressive growth as well with Japan, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and China being notably strong in Q2.
Now turning to expenses, traffic acquisition costs were $1.5 billion, or 28.4% of total advertising revenue, down from 29.2% in Q1. AdSense TAC was $1.3 billion, while TAC related to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our websites totaled $154 million in the quarter. As we grow our AdSense Partner Network and embark on new initiatives, we may see additional pressure on TAC rates going forward.
Other cost of revenue, which includes $9 million in stock-based compensation, increased $49 million over Q1 to $674 million. The largest driver of the increase was the increase in costs related to our data centers, including depreciation, equipment and operations. We continue to anticipate that other cost of sales could increase going forward. 
Other than cost of revenue, operating expenses totaled $1.64 billion, including approximately $264 million in stock-based compensation. Expenses related to payroll and facilities increased $1 million over Q1 to $810 million. 
At the end of the quarter, we had a full-time employee base of 19,604. We added 448 net new employees in Q2 with roughly half the new non-DoubleClick hires coming on board in engineering, followed by sales and marketing. We have implemented and continue to follow a discipline hiring process in all areas of our organization. But as we have indicated in the past, we will continue to invest in our core business both in the U.S. and internationally. Remember also that we usually see an uptick in starts over the summer, coinciding with the end of the academic year. 
Turning to non-GAAP operating profit which excludes stock-based compensation, it increased to $1.9 billion in Q2, with non-GAAP operating margins of 34.5%. Note that interest income and other in Q2 was $58 million, down $109 million from Q1. To be clear, this was not a writedown nor was this due to any losses. Instead it was primarily due to lower yields on our cash balance; lower average cash balances as a result of cash used in the first quarter to acquired DoubleClick; lower net realized gains on the sale of our marketable securities; and an increase in expenses as a result of more activity under our foreign exchange hedging programs. 
Finally, turning to cash, operating cash flow remained strong at $1.77 billion, with CapEx for the quarter of $698 million. As in previous quarters, the majority of our CapEx was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data center construction, production of servers and networking equipment. We expect to continue to make significant investments in CapEx in future quarters.  Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure which we define as cash flow from operations less CapEx, remained strong at $1.7 billion, up 63% year over year. 
In summary, we believe our core business continues to demonstrate strength while we make key investments to pursue long-term growth opportunities. 
At this point I want to take a moment to thank Eric, Larry, Sergey and the rest of the management team for having had the privilege of working with all of them. This is an opportunity that I will never forget.
Let me turn it over to Hal. 
Hal Varian
Thanks, George. Eric asked me to comment on the state of the economic environment and how that’s impacting Google. 
When we look across sectors of the United States we see that on a year-on-year basis, the query growth has been positive in every sector we track, even including those sectors that are generally economically sensitive such as automotive, real estate and travel. We also see that year-on-year revenue growth is positive in every major sector expect for real estate, and even that one is only down by a small amount. 
When we look at the sub-sectors, we see some interesting patterns. The weaker components are just the ones you would expect to see based on the macroeconomic climate: auto financing, home financing and real estate agencies. These are the sorts of queries you would expect to see when auto or real estate transactions have already taken place, and we see, as we all know, fewer transactions are taking place in those sectors. 
It is interesting to note that year-over-year automotive ad spend is up, even though the growth in auto financing is down. I interpret this as saying that auto advertisers are willing to spend on clicks, but the weakness is on the consumer side. However, I should emphasis this behavior is not universal. Spending seems to be holding up pretty well in other consumer durable categories such as home appliances and home furnishings. 
When we turn to Europe, we see a similar pattern. In the UK we had across-the-board year-to-year growth in both revenue and queries, with the sole expectation being real estate. Continental Europe grew in both queries and revenue in every major vertical.
So to summarize, when we look across verticals we see that consumers are being cautious in their online spending patterns just as they are in their offline spending. Despite the weakness in the economy, advertising revenue seems to be holding up remarkably well in most sectors. I think this illustrates the point that we have made several times. During periods of slow economic growth, the last thing an advertiser wants to cut is its spending on search-based advertising.
So with that, let me pass the mic to Sergey, who is going to talk about what he will be doing in products. 
Sergey Brin
Hello, everyone. It is really exciting for me to update you over the past quarter. We have had a lot of substantial improvements, new launches. Let me just start with search. We have substantially increased the size of our index, and in particular, actually the index of documents that we refresh every few minutes has also grown tremendously. So now, our users get much fresher and faster results, across a greater range of sources.
We have -- just all told, to give you a sense for this -- launched over 100 search quality improvements this quarter, so roughly one a day. Some of the highlights:
Again, we have increased coverage in universal search, which means you get your web pages mixed in with video and images, news, books, all of those things we are able to show more and more. That improves our search results and it pays us a double dividend for all of the work we have been doing on corpuses such as book search.
We also just added blog results at the bottom of the page in the past quarter, and our blending of Maps results we have put into 130 more countries than we had in the past.
We have also been running more one box; for example those of you in Europe might have enjoyed our Euro 2008 one box in June during the soccer tournament. 
Let me just take a step away from just the basic search. Many of you, I know, use iGoogle and in fact we know that because we have had such tremendous growth, especially internationally. More than 60% of iGoogle users are now outside of the U.S.
We had some very important developments, in particular with themes this quarter. You might have seen our iGoogle artist campaign where 68 artists across 22 countries created new themes for the product. This encouraged hundreds of thousands of people to sign up for iGoogle, and of course the good thing is so many of them changed their themes to these artist themes. I have personally set my iGoogle page now to go do a rotation across the top themes, and that is really fun. Everyday I get a new feel and they are aesthetically pretty exciting and varied.
If you are listening to me right now you probably speak English pretty well, though of course if you are reading a transcript that has been translated using Google Translate then you might not. It is very important to be able to have access to information in languages that you don’t speak, especially if you are a non-English speaker. I mean, the amount of information that’s out there that can be useful to you that’s not necessarily in your native language is huge. 
To this end, we have been of course working on Google Translate. It now covers over 20 languages. We’ve added 10 just in this past quarter alone and now we let you translate from any one of those languages to any other of those languages. We’ve been able to improve the performance and have tremendous growth in usage as well.
We’ve also been working on our cross language search so we don’t necessarily just search literally in the language that you search; we are able to produce translated results in other languages now, more automatically. You can expect us to continue to expand that work.
In ads I should highlight a notable development. Our AdSense Network now allows third parties to host and serve ads, and this has been important to many advertisers. Just as one example, Lenovo is now advertising with us because we can support this kind of third-party ad serving.
Now advertisers find out more about where they should be advertising because we’ve launch the Google Ad Planner. That lets you see what kind of sites a particular audience that is interested in whatever the advertisers’ are advertising, which sites do they visit? What are the breakdowns of demographics? It lets you do very complicated statistical analysis and I encourage you all to try it out, even if you are not an advertiser, it is pretty fun to be able to play with that data.
Let me just jump a little bit onto YouTube. Probably most of you have had a chance to try to watch some YouTube videos, and in fact, our data suggest that more and more of you are. We now have 13 hours of video uploaded every single minute, so as you can imagine, it would take quite a many lifetimes to watch all the YouTube videos. It also gives you the opportunity, of course, to watch video on very specific topics that may be of interest to you. 
We've also been experimenting on YouTube with a variety of advertising formats and we have had some great successes. Lionsgate marked the opening of the film “The Forbidden Kingdom”, for example, and it had over 4 million video views on YouTube just from that promotion. So that was very exciting for us and for Lionsgate.
I should mention that mobile search has been growing quite a bit, and of course you may have heard about our partnership that we've launched in this past quarter with NTT DoCoMo in Japan. Japan is a very strong market for mobile search because of the devices, because of the culture it is just a really tremendous environment. People do many, many mobile searches. We have a robust advertising market there for mobile search. We are certainly optimistic that many of these advances which may initiate in Japan will carry over to the rest of the world as the devices and culture catch up.
I want to also mention that our mobile search experience, which we have now rolled out to more countries and we have made substantially faster, is also causing a lot of growth in that segment for us. 
One of things that I am most excited to tell you about today is our progress with Apps. I should mention first of all that our enterprise business with respect to Apps has been growing very rapidly. There are now more than half a million businesses that are using Google Apps for their day-to-day productivity, and that is just a tremendous number.
Just to give you color on what some of these businesses include, in this past quarter Valeo, one of the world’s leading automotive suppliers now has 32,000 users using Google Apps, including of course Gmail, Calendar, Docs and so forth.
The Government of Washington D.C. has 38,000 users on Google Apps. General Electric has adopted the security side of the Apps products which was formerly Postini, and that’s running on over 300,000 users. Just to call out a few other highlights, the Telegraph Media Group and Sanmina both also adopted Google Apps.
So, it’s been a very exciting quarter for that. Starting from these half a million businesses, including some of these incredibly successful businesses, we really expect this to be an important area for growth and development. 
I just want to tell you, we don’t view Google Apps and what not as we don’t want to create a closed environment or a walled garden. We really want to encourage more and more cloud computing and we want to see more and more companies out there successful in deploying cloud solutions.
One of the things we launched in this past quarter is the Google Apps Engine which basically means that developers can easily write an application and deploy it on our scaled infrastructure rather than having to try to put together all of their own computers, data centers, networking, all of that stuff. We handled all of that for the developers.
We have a rapidly growing base. Just a few fun examples: we had a nine-year-old boy who contacted us with a bunch of questions, and then he has been able to develop his app on the Google Apps Engine. He said that he has been able to do it now because previously he was spending all of his allowance on hosting, and he could no longer afford that.
Other, more commercial ventures include PixVerse, a chat application that switched to Google Apps Engine after we launched it, and it was subsequently purchased by the social network Hi5. As well as for those of you who are into poking, BuddyPoke, a very popular open social app which is running on Orkut and MySpace has also been developed on the Google Apps Engine.
We expect that we're going to have a lot of uptake of our various developer products and APIs, including the Google Apps Engine, and ultimately we think that the cloud is just a really great place to deploy Apps because of the simplicity for end users to access them, the ease of updating and maintaining them; it is really a great environment. We obviously live it everyday and we believe it really helps people be more effective and productive with their day-to-day lives.
Anyway, all told, a great quarter, lots and lots of progress and it has been a pleasure to talk to you about it. 
Eric Schmidt
Thank you very much, Sergey. Why don’t we go straight to everybody’s questions? So are we ready? Let’s hear the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question from Imran Khan - JP Morgan.
Imran Khan - JP Morgan 
First, if I look at that UK growth rate, it seems like on a year-over-year basis the growth rate decelerated 10 points. I was trying to better understand, is it because of the law of large numbers, or are you seeing any specific weakness that’s dragging the growth down there? 
My second question is related to the mobile search. Sergey, you talked about the mobile search opportunity. Do you think that the mobile search will expand the search volume? What kind of impact do you expect on your revenue per queries with that? Also, have you have seen any impact from Apple iPhone yet? Thank you.
Eric Schmidt

Jonathan, do you want to go ahead and answer the UK question?
Jonathan Rosenberg

Sure. Thanks, Imran. I think basically we are just seeing the typical Q2 seasonality. If you look back at Q1, that of course was very big. I think we talked in the Q1 call about some of the verticals like travel. 
The other point would be that we have very, very high market share in the UK. As our market share grows, I think in past quarters when you looked at seasonality, the gains in market share may have been masking some of the seasonality. Now what we’re seeing is just the typical, appropriate Q2 seasonality. [Inaudible] the impact was negligible.
Eric Schmidt

Sergey?
Sergey Brin

On mobile I certainly expect to see an uptick in search volume due to mobile because you are obviously not always at your desktop, but you pretty much always want to know something. 
With respect to the revenues per query I think that will vary from market to market and I think it will also vary as we develop more specialized monetization programs for mobile phones. You know, in some respects you can’t fit as much advertising, obviously, on a really small screen.  On the other hand, the queries are very localized. I mean, you might be standing right next to that pizza place that wants to entice you to become a customer, or something like that. So I think there’s an opportunity for much more fine-tuned targeting. Both of those things are going to balance out. 
With respect to the iPhone, I don’t have data off the top of my head with respect to the latest iPhone 3G launch but certainly the iPhone, much as I mentioned also the maturity of the Japan market, these better devices -- devices with great browsers like the iPhone that make it easy for people to search and then view the results -- they definitely have much higher usage per device than other kinds of devices. 
On a rough order of magnitude, imagine that by 30 times as many searches per user might be done by an iPhone user as compared to a conventional cell phone. So I think as you see more iPhones out there, as you see more other phones that also start to have capable browsers and input methods, I think you’re going to see tremendous growth there.

Your next question comes from Brian Pitz - Banc of America Securities.
Brian Pitz - Banc of America Securities

We have a couple of questions around ad coverage. Clearly you’ve intentionally reduced coverage on Google.com over the last number of quarters to improve ad quality. Would you give us a sense for how far you are in this process? 
On a related note, you extended Auto Match to more advertisers this quarter. Do you see this as a significant driver of coverage going forward? Any other comments on coverage would be great. Thanks.
Eric Schmidt

Jonathan?
Jonathan Rosenberg

Sure. So basically coverage, you know, coverage I think from a quarter-to-quarter basis has been going down. It’s pretty much at an all-time low relative to the last few quarters. That’s basically our continued focus on quality. I don’t really see that changing significantly.  Larry often says that we’d be best off if we just showed one ad, the perfect ad. So I really don’t think that coverage is going to change much.
Eric Schmidt

The second question was?
Brian Pitz - Banc of America Securities

Pertaining to Auto Match, traction there. Do you see this potentially as a driver of coverage?
Jonathan Rosenberg

Yes, sure. We only just started expanding Auto Match. It was in beta so we only expanded it, I think, to a slightly bigger group of advertisers this quarter. Certainly Auto Match can help increase coverage because it helps find more keywords that a query will trigger on, but we’re going to apply the same quality efforts to the output of Auto Match. Overall I think that the net result in terms of total coverage would not be significantly greater. I do think the impact on revenue would be positive.
Brian Pitz - Banc of America Securities

Any sense on what percentage of advertisers aren’t really optimizing their budgets that Auto Match could help with?
Jonathan Rosenberg

Wow. A large number.
Eric Schmidt

I think it’s really too early to give you. The answer is it should apply to everybody. Sergey, do you want to add a little bit about coverage?
Sergey Brin

I just want to talk a little bit about that. There is some evidence that I think we’ve been probably a little bit more aggressive in decreasing coverage than we ought to have been. Historically we’ve had this 50/50 rough notion that when we have an improvement in advertising targeting we try to split the benefit, if you will. We try to reduce our coverage at the same time as improving the monetization. 
But clearly that’s not the ideal strategy indefinitely, because we don’t want to end up with no ads. And in fact from a quality point of view, we now find our ads are a significant addition quality-wise to our page. They are just a very important source of information. We’ve been actually re-examining some of that. There was some evidence internally that perhaps we were a little overly aggressive in decreasing coverage in this past quarter.
Operator

Your next question comes from James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs

Hal, I think you mentioned that queries were up year on year in every major sector, but erratic within subsectors; for example, in auto finance as opposed to autos. If queries are down in a particular subsector, do advertisers generally respond by bidding up the keywords that are available so they can fully spend their budgets? Or is that not the case and budgets go unspent?
Hal Varian

Sometimes we see that happening where advertisers are competing more and more aggressively for a smaller set of consumers. So we typically do see a price response to this slackening in the sector. We’ve seen that even in automotive, for example, in the Spring when there were a lot of deals offered to get cars off the lot and the automakers were advertising quite aggressively in all media to try to convince consumers to buy. So this is an effect that we sometimes encounter.
Operator

Your next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch

Eric, on the press release you chose to highlight that you are seeing some economic weakness and I don’t think the company was talking much about that last quarter. Are you seeing things kind of deteriorate a little bit further than where we were a quarter ago? Can you give some color on that? 
On the YouTube acquisition, I am just wondering where you are at with some press comments out recently. Where you are at on that versus your deal model at this point?
Eric Schmidt

I’m going to have Hal actually talk a little bit about the nature of the environment, because I think all of us have anecdotal evidence but in fact Google has continued to do well. There is obviously evidence of a slowdown in the U.S. and Europe; you read it in the paper every day. We continue to believe that we are very, very well-positioned in such a slowdown and especially if it gets worse. 
The reason is there’s a flight to quality and in particular a flight to measurability. So our economics are more driven by, for example, if people stop searching for something we might not be able to do ads against it. Maybe Hal can articulate that a little bit better than I can. 
On the YouTube side, we are enormously happy with YouTube. YouTube is a cultural and end user success that is far, far greater than we ever expected. On the revenue side, we are working on revenue scenarios and new revenue products.  I personally do not believe that the perfect ad product for YouTube has been invented yet. We’ve just brought out some little in-video ads which look very good. 
Hal, maybe you want to talk about the economics and maybe Omid, you can talk a little bit about YouTube sales?
Hal Varian

Sure. On the consumer side I already mentioned that some durables like consumer appliances and furnishings were holding up pretty well. In fact, if you look at apparel and shopping people are still spending money online in a pretty strong way. 
I think part of what is happening is that as times get a little uncertain price-sensitive consumers are going to shop more carefully to try to make every dollar count. That means they are going to be doing research online and they are going to be doing shopping online. So I think we have a little bit of the Wal-Mart Effect going on that as times get tough, people are going to watch their dollars. In many cases that means doing more shopping online.
Omid Kordestani

I wanted to add to Eric’s comments about YouTube. I think we are spending a lot of time internally on understanding how to streamline and integrate DoubleClick, improve the sales process as well as just pure customer activity. We are having great success. 
Again, as usual, I’d like to highlight some of our advertising names from Lenovo, Foot Locker, Lionsgate, Oreo, Kraft Foods, Ikea, and Lipton Tea. I mean these are the kinds of advertisers that we really did not have access or the proper types of advertising opportunities for before, as much as we do now. 
The Foot Locker example is a particularly good one as the media they use on Google was extremely broad from YouTube search, the content network, within the content network, also access to MySpace, Gadget ads, print ads and audio ads. So you can just see the way that our salesforce and our product teams are working with a broader set of advertisers, a broader set of offerings and a very much integrated platform approach. 
Search has taken a long time for us to develop and it still takes a lot of time for us and a lot of hard work. We’re putting a lot of energy on getting the right approach on YouTube and display advertising.

Your next question comes from Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners.
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners

A couple of questions on DoubleClick. First I was wondering if you could outline how much it contributed in the quarter? 
Second, if you could indicate if you’re seeing any macroeconomic impact there. Obviously you made some comments about search specifically, but I was wondering if you could highlight it for DoubleClick? 
Third, some comments about how you are changing the buying process around display and where you see the innovations coming in display over the next year or two?
Eric Schmidt
We are not going to break out DoubleClick. Basically it’s early and so far we’re very pleased with it. It looks like it was a very, very sharp decision on our part to go ahead and get the integration, the team looks very strong. 
The strategy, once the acquisition was approved and so forth and so on, was to develop a broad product line that went from the large customer, large advertiser which was the traditional DoubleClick customer all the way down to the very small advertiser through Ad Words and essentially integrate all of that offering. This is public information; we’ve said this for the previous year during the regulatory strategy. Indeed, that’s happening now. 
So the theory here is that an advertiser will be able to advertise across all of the different sized publishers with one mechanism; that’s the goal. We think we can achieve that, and it will be fairly soon. Some number of months, not years.
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners

The macro?
Eric Schmidt
 
No particular change in the macro environment. DoubleClick is doing well. Omid, do you want to emphasize any of this?
Omid Kordestani

I agree with Eric. I think we have anecdotal experiences. Some customers that act erratically I think are really affected maybe by the macro environments and stop the spending but then we see that pick up again the following month. So it’s very hard to judge this. I don’t think we have any trends that we can comment on.
Jonathan Rosenberg
Some of the innovation has already started. We have an internal roadmap in terms of the innovations for the next couple of years which I obviously can’t go through here. But just this quarter we launched the Ad Planner which basically lets advertisers designate target audiences and see exactly which sites they want to attract for an audience. We’ve got the Google Ad Manager in test which is basically a free tool that helps publishers sell, schedule, deliver and measure their inventory.  Sergey I think mentioned in his script the third-party serving and we’ve also got some new features to let advertisers select target sites and keywords. 
So all of that, I think, is really addressing the big problem in display which is the highly fragmented market. That’s the focus of most of the innovations that you’ll see coming out in the next year or so.

Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers.
Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers

A question for George, we’re not letting you off the hook quite yet. On the interest income, you detailed four pieces actually that contributed to the decrease in the interest income quarter to quarter. Could you provide a little bit more color there? In particular, how should we think about that going forward? Is this a one quarter effect, or is it something that we’re likely to see continue over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.
George Reyes

I think what we’re trying to portray here is that in fact we have a very healthy business and we have been investing in the business. The lower yield on our cash balances is what has really brought down what you’ve seen thus far, all the way through the average cash balances. As a result, that cash is used first.  DoubleClick is also a consumer of that as well.
Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers

In terms of the marketable securities and the FX hedging, are you implying that those two are less significant factors to the impact this quarter?
George Reyes

No, we’re actually in the process of building our internal portfolio here so it’s hard for me to say more than that.
Operator

Your next question comes from Ben Schachter - UBS.
Ben Schachter - UBS

The headcount growth was really among its lowest levels in a long time. Is that 500 new net employees a number you are comfortable with on a quarterly basis? Where are you still looking to add and what areas are you comfortable with headcount?
Eric Schmidt

In the first place, we won’t suggest a number going forward. The company is now a reasonably large company by comparison to its peers and we don’t need massive new people in large communities that were not there before. We’ve largely built out a good management structure globally so it’s really dependent upon the kind of quality of people we can hire. 
You’ll remember a few quarters ago we actually allowed the hiring engine to get ahead of things and we said that we would focus on that a little bit more carefully and we have indeed done so. So I think what you’ll see going forward is prudent management of headcount growth. The company is going to continue to grow. This number may or may not be a specific number going forward but the important point is we are paying a lot of attention to headcount. We want to make sure that we maintain the quality and of course also as a larger company we need to make sure that we can use the resource effectively. We never want to misuse somebody’s talents as an employee.
Ben Schachter - UBS

If I could just follow up on a question on mobile, Sergey, you had discussed the evolution of the marketplace. At some point, can we expect to see a completely separate marketplace for mobile ads that comes with its own auction? Or will it continue to be an extension of the current model?
Sergey Brin

Currently we do allow advertisers to place separate ads for mobile. In fact, I see them converging more in the future because once you start to get these phones that have fully capable browsers and things like that, then there’s not that much reason for disparity. 
Now, at the same time as I mentioned, phones in some sense will have new capabilities that the desktop doesn’t such as location, things like that. We may add some capability beyond the basic desktop advertising capability that we have. I think it will be a more fluid experience for advertisers in terms of you can select “please run on mobile too”, or “don’t”, rather than trying to have completely separate worlds.
Jonathan Rosenberg

Just adding to Sergey’s comments, I agree with him. I’d just like to give you an example of one of the dynamics that will be different on the mobile phones. We’ve been talking for awhile about the fact that when you are on a mobile phone, you are much more likely to be interested in consummating a transaction if you run a search. 
One of the winners of the 1,700 applications submitted for the Android Developer Challenge was a product that was developed called Android Scan. Basically what it allows a user to do is take a picture of a product with a barcode and then they can research the product on their mobile browser. They can do price comparisons, they can figure out how far a store that can actually sell that product might be, or they could actually figure out who to buy it from online. Imagine the value of an ad in that kind of a scenario. 
So the bidding mechanisms for some of the local ads will differ in terms of the efforts that we have to scale to get them onto mobile but in many ways, they could be much, much more valuable.

Operator

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citi

On the G&A line it seemed a little bit ahead of expectations. Were there any one-time integration-related costs in that G&A line? 
Back to YouTube, Eric you made a comment about not having yet found maybe the ideal ad solution. Could you just talk about what the technical challenge is there? Or is it finding the right format or figuring out a way to best target ads against, or trying to figure out what the real content of a video is? Thank you very much.
Eric Schmidt

On the YouTube side, we basically are innovators in advertising and we’ve tried post-roll, pre-roll, in the roll kind of ads. We’re having a great deal of success now with these in-view ads where the ads are essentially in the bottom and embedded inside of the video. That looks like a pretty good winner right there. 
We’ve also had some significant success with gadget ads and gadget video ads are likely to be particularly effective because they allow you to tell a story. If you look, the advertisers that we are working with and the content that we are working with are also using the format differently. As a typical example, the Lionsgate deal which was announced yesterday, Lionsgate works with people who upload segments of the Lionsgate movies that they like and they capture them using our ClaimWare content product, and then they can run ads against them. 
So again, here’s a community that’s busy making copies that are not authorized of content, and Lionsgate has the good judgment to say rather than go and sue those customers, instead let’s go capture that, show an ad against them and get them even more excited about our content, our other content. 
So we think those kinds of models are sustainable and scalable on the Internet and are likely to be very, very significant sources of revenue. I think it’s axiomatic that a new form -- and I view YouTube as a new form of video entertainment -- will not ultimately use the old forms to monetize. 
There will be new monetization forms that will go for the new entertainment form, and that’s what we’re seeking. That is the Holy Grail.  When we find it or the combination of it, it’s likely to be very, very large because of the scale and scope of YouTube. 
On the G&A line, I want to make sure we answer that question.
George Reyes

Mark, this is George Reyes. The main increase was due to legal and professional and outsourcing services, as well as fees. That’s your answer. As you know, we also don’t give guidance.
Mark Mahaney - Citi

One-time or generally sustainable?
George Reyes

Generally sustainable? No.
Eric Schmidt

Unfortunately, the legal stuff is bursty because we have suits. It’s “welcome to the information economy.” Next question?

Your next question comes from Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank

First of all, you talked earlier about basically your ad coverage may have come down a little too much, and Larry’s idea is to be a little bit more targeting oriented, serving the right ad. Can you talk about in terms of that evolution or phase of the business, how far along are you in trying to better optimize the ads against the intent of the consumer across the entire network and platform today? 
Second, on the AdSense for content side of the business, how difficult or easy would it be to convert it into a display ad network? Is this something that you would look to do? How does display ads around AdSense for content, do those two things marry up nicely or not?
Sergey Brin

Great questions. Let me take them in the reverse order. With respect to display in AdSense for content, we actually allow for display in AdSense for content today. That’s a publisher setting that publishers need to choose. In those cases where they are chosen then we will run display ads to the extent that their yield is higher than the text ads that we can run in that space.  So that’s something that we are doing today and we are looking to grow and we are certainly excited about. 
In general, let me just take a step back. Looking at the evolution of our overall search, text ad system from its initial start when we could barely feed the ad team pizza with the money that we were able to generate off the first iteration of our ads to several iterations down the road, over a number of years, and through the maturation and the attraction of the advertiser base and them being able to set up really good campaigns for them. I mean, that’s a multi-year process to get to where we are now and we obviously are continuing to improve, to attract new advertisers, to improve the targeting and so forth. 
Now that we have the advertiser base, we don’t necessarily need to wait quite as long to attract the advertiser base to begin with. But for advertisers to create new types of ads for new mediums and what not, these things do take time for us to go through all the experimentation of what formats and systems might work best, that also takes time. 
Just me looking back going from ‘98, ‘99, 2000 where we were then with search ads, I feel some of these areas -- YouTube ads, content ads, display and what not -- are actually progressing at a faster pace.
Jeetil Patel - Deutsche Bank

You made a point earlier that you may have gone too far on the ad coverage side and the ad relevance. Are you seeing, basically, that it’s affecting the frequency of usage or search frequency because you may have dialed down the ad coverage a little too much? Is that where the impact you are seeing? And if you dial it back up a bit you may see greater usage from a consumer standpoint in terms of frequency of searching across the entire network?
Sergey Brin

First of all, we certainly run plenty of experiments. We’re all the time running experiments. We run some people without any ads at all, and we know that our ads add value so we know that we’re happy about having them. 
Now, I don’t know it’s the case that we necessarily decreased them past, below the optimal point, but I know that we will do that in the near future if we continue with the system that we had in place. That’s what we’ve really had to have second thoughts about. 
What makes more sense to me is to go for the optimal coverage, if you will. That’s what we’re trying to figure out exactly how to do now.

Your next question comes from David Joseph - Morgan Stanley.
David Joseph - Morgan Stanley

Universal search, it seems like you have been ramping it up or you ramped it up more during the quarter. I’m just wondering what percentage of total search results universal search is today? Also, what different user behavior is seen with universal search versus traditional text search? 
George, it looks like the incremental margin for Google improved pretty nicely sequentially and year over year. We do know that you had an easier comparison with the year-ago period, but I’m wondering if you also have been implementing or if some of the programs that you have been implementing for increased financial discipline are actually starting to work now? Thank you.
George Reyes

Yes, we have actually made a very concerted effort to drive more accountability into the business. That’s a theme that will carry forward.
Eric Schmidt

Sergey, do you want to answer the universal question?
Sergey Brin

Yes, universal search. So we’ve got a bit under one-third of all queries now have some kind of universal search component in them. By comparison, in the first quarter it was more like one-tenth; so it’s a big, big improvement. 
Our feeling is definitely that this, and experiments by the way, also justify this, but this is significantly improved information for our end users. It’s amazing to me just if I look at the video, for example, video universal which alone is at about 10% now of queries, I mean people have videos for things that you wouldn’t expect. 
I mentioned before, I was looking to buy a RAID, like an array of disks to store stuff on. It’s not the kind of query you would expect might have good videos about it. But in fact, the particular RAID I was interested in, somebody had put together a video. This is how you take it out of the box; this is how you swap a drive on it; all those things. And in fact, that compelled me to buy that particular RAID. 
I think that you’ll find increasing universal coverage in purposes that you wouldn’t expect, and that source particularly would be valuable because the user would not have thought to click on the separate video tab in that query. We have to bring that information to the user; that’s what we’re doing.
David Joseph - Morgan Stanley

So are you seeing click-through rates a little bit less on universal search? Does this actually present a little bit of a different model for search, where you’re going to be able to monetize video a little bit differently? Or images, for that matter?
Sergey Brin

Less than universal search?
Eric Schmidt

No, again, the system in aggregate is actually where you are seeing --
Sergey Brin

I see. You are saying “how would it affect”. We monitor these things pretty closely when we launch them and it’s not that we are unwilling to launch things that might adversely affect the ad click-through rates or what not, but in sum total the launches that we’ve done I don’t think are negative. I think it’s positive.

Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford Bernstein

Could you give us more detail about your wireless strategy and indicate just how you intend to participate in wireless in the U.S. over the next four to five years? Could you give us any updates on the Android alliance? When are Android devices expected? 
Could you give us an indication of, do you have to share revenues with Apple and/or AT&T to get Google onto the iPhone? Thank you.
Eric Schmidt

Sergey, do you want to start on wireless, overall wireless strategy?
Sergey Brin

Overall wireless is very simple. We want our products and the internet and the web as a whole available on as many devices in as many different markets as possible, so it’s very easy. We have a two-fold approach for that. First, we write our Apps and try to make them available on many different platforms like the iPhone that you mentioned, or we put them on Symbian devices, on BlackBerries, on Windows Mobile devices, all those we have Google Apps for. 
We’ve also, because we’ve had some challenge sometimes getting things out like necessarily easily being able to get access to location data to make maps work really well or things like that, we’ve developed this Android platform. We’ve had the same calling from carriers, from handset makers and other application makers that they just want to be able to get these things out more easily. 
So we are very excited about Android. We are still expecting phones before the end of the year to ship with Android.
Eric Schmidt

Jonathan, do you want to talk a little bit about some of the partner stuff?
Jonathan Rosenberg

The main data point in terms of Android, there are 34 companies in the Open Handset Alliance so we are doing pretty well there and I already alluded to the contest that we ran and the results there with that example of the Android Scan barcode. There are others that we are very excited about. I think there’s a Weather Channel application that will alert people and wake them up when there’s a severe weather alert that they need to be aware of. There are some fantastic ones, one called GWalk that helps people take city tours dynamically, and it adjusts to your location and shows points of interest. So there are already very, very significant efforts going on in the developer community in anticipation of the launches later this year.
Eric Schmidt
Let’s finish up. Thank you very much, Jonathan and everybody else. I want to thank everybody for spending so much time with us. We look forward to talking to you next quarter and please have a good summer. Thank you very much.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/85608-google-inc-q2-2008-earnings-call-transcript

Also please note that certain financial measures we use on this call such as EPS, net income, operating margin and operating income are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to Eric.
Eric Schmidt
Well thank you very much, Krista, and we’re obviously very pleased with another strong quarter for Google. It’s clear to us that we’re well-positioned for 2008 and beyond, regardless of the business environment that we find ourselves surrounded by. 
The Search, Ads and Apps strategy that we articulated last year is beginning to show transformative effects; literally things that people could not do before the products and services that we’ve offered in each of the categories. The business model continues to work very well and we’ve had good, disciplined management of our operating expenses, so thank you very much for the management team. It’s also interesting to note that paid clicks growth is much higher than has been speculated by third parties.
In Search, we continue to invest in quality, particularly internationally. Quality improvements lead to increased traffic and share. Quality here means better algorithms, more content – deeper, if you will -- into the web; a larger index, faster response, all that surfing. But it also implies things like Maps and Earth and geospatial information, it’s all integrated in a way that people can find things and see things that they could never do before.
In Ads, we continue to increase value for advertisers and publishers; again, broader and deeper solutions. Better tools for advertisers, many, many quality improvements in advertising which has the interesting effect, which means that we’re showing fewer but much better ads in each cycle. That’s a key part of the Google success story. 
We’re putting more and more flexibility and control in the hands of advertisers so they can decide exactly where their ad should go and measure it in the way using Analytics that they could not do before. It’s also important to note that DoubleClick has been added now to the portfolio and DoubleClick is hugely strategic for us. It allows us to offer a much more comprehensive solution for advertisers and publishers. This has been asked for long time and now we are able to do it.
In the Apps case, we are working to build out a whole new online web experience and we’re beginning to have all of the pieces now in place. For example, the recently announced Salesforce.com partnership allows us to integrate for an enterprise customer with the Salesforce.com products as well as all of the Google application services and sold through their direct sales operation.
By doing these partnerships and by investing heavily in new applications models we think people will spend more and more time online and they will able to do things like sharing documents, sharing calendars, dealing with photos and all those kinds of things in a way that had not been possible before. 
This has all been possible because of the many, many talented Googlers and the executive leadership that we’ve seen in the last quarter and I want to thank everybody for that. The Google model really does rely on technology and innovation. The repeatable and scalable business that we have built is really poised for global growth. 
So with that, George, do you want to take us through the numbers?
George Reyes
Thanks, Eric and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin, please note that our consolidated results as reported today include the results of DoubleClick from March 11, the date of the acquisition, through the end of the quarter. The overall effect was immaterial to revenue and only slightly dilutive to operating income, net income and earnings per share.
Turning to our results, we had another strong quarter with gross revenue increasing 42% over Q1 2007 to $5.2 billion. Goggle.com performed very well, up 49% year over year to $3.4 billion, driven by strong traffic growth and to a lesser extent, monetization growth. AdSense revenue grew 25% over Q1 2007, reflecting solid performance across both the Content and Search networks.
Now let’s look at aggregate paid clicks growth. Aggregate paid clicks include clicks related to ads served on Google properties, as well as ads served on our partner sites. Aggregate paid clicks grew approximately 20% over Q1 2007 and approximately 4% over Q4. Paid click growth on Google.com in the U.S. remains healthy and other markets are showing strong growth as well.
Now I’ll discuss our international performance. International revenue increased to $2.65 billion, now accounting for 51% of total revenue. International markets have tremendous potential for growth. As is typical in the first quarter, the UK was strong with revenues of $803 million and 16% sequential growth as the travel and finance verticals rebounded as expected from Q4.
Revenue growth in EMEA was primarily driven by strong performance in the UK, Benelux and the Nordic countries fueled by strong pan-European performance in travel. We also saw solid gains in relatively smaller markets such Ireland, Spain and Italy. Asia and Latin America continue to show impressive growth as well with India, Argentina Australia and Japan being notable performers in the quarter.
Now turning to expenses, traffic acquisition costs were $1.5 billion or 29% of total advertising revenue, down from 30% in Q4. AdSense TAC was $1.3 billion, while TAC related to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our websites totaled $143 million in the quarter. Other cost of revenue, which included $9 million in stock-based compensation increased $108 million over Q4 to $624 million. The largest driver of the increase was the increase in costs related to our data centers including depreciation, equipment and operations. We continue to anticipate that other cost of sales could increase going forward. 
Other than cost of revenue, operating expenses in Q1 totaled $1.5 billion, including approximately $272 million in stock-based compensation. Expenses related to payroll and facilities increased $53 million over Q4 to $809 million. 
At the end of the quarter we had a full-time employee base of 19,156 including more than 1,500 heads from DoubleClick. Since the close of the acquisition we’ve conducted a review of our ongoing headcount requirements and approximately 10% of the US DoubleClick workforce was laid off in early April. An additional 15%, approximately, are expected to leave the company in the U.S. in the near to intermediate term, because they are in a transitional role as they move through the system. These headcount reductions apply only to the U.S. and do not include employees associated with the future planned divestitures of the Performics SEM business. To-date there have been no headcount reductions outside the U.S. 
On an organic basis, excluding DoubleClick, we added approximately 800 employees in Q1 with the majority of new hires in engineering, followed by sales and marketing. We have implemented and continue to follow a disciplined hiring process in all areas of the organization, but as we’ve indicated in the past, we will continue to invest in our core business both in the US and internationally.
Non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock-based compensation, increased to $1.8 billion in Q1, with non-GAAP operating margins of 35.2%, approximately 30 basis points above Q4.
Turning to tax, our effective tax rate for Q1 was 24%, down from 25% in Q4 of ‘07, reflecting the mix of foreign versus domestic earnings. 
Finally turning to cash, operating cash flow remained strong at $1.78 billion with CapEx for the quarter at $842 million. As in previous quarters, the majority of our CapEx was related to IT infrastructure investments including data center construction, production of servers and networking equipment. We expect to continue to make significant investments in CapEx in future quarters.
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure which we define as cash flow from operations less CapEx, remained strong at $938 million, up 50% year over year. 
So in summary, we believe our results reflect the strength of our core business across our three primary initiatives -- Search, Ads, and Apps -- with disciplined investments that position us very well to capitalize on the long-term opportunities we see for Google.
Now I’ll turn it over to Sergey.
Sergey Brin
Thanks, George. We are obviously very excited about this past quarter and in listening to the results you’ve heard so far, let me highlight some of the incredible Search improvements we’ve made in the past 90 days.
We have launched almost 100 Search quality improvements just in this quarter, so we’re talking about over more than one per day, including weekends. A lot of these have been international Search quality improvements. You will note just on the more visible things, our new tailored homepages in Asian markets. Japan now has a completely new homepage that is tailored to Japan and our Korean Search now has the universal search results that you’ve seen in some other countries.
Now we’ve also done a much better job selecting local country results and demoting foreign results in those countries. As a result, we’ve actually seen our Search quality measures uptick significantly in several countries. 
Also, I just wanted to highlight some of the user interface improvements we’ve been doing. You’ll notice that you can now search within a site directly from the Google Search results. So, you’ll get a top level site in your search results, but if you want to further search within that site there is a box right on the search results page and you can quickly do a query. If you search for something like NASA or a IMDb you’ll see examples of this.
Now I’ve told you in the past year how we have deployed Universal Search and I mentioned a number of times but the work wasn’t done with the initial launch. In fact, over the past year since we launched it we’ve been able to double the number of queries where we show these blended results especially in images, video and books.  I’m sure many of you are seeing these all the time. This has really improved our ability to answer questions. We’ve also deployed Universal Search in a number a of countries; we just added 17 countries that support the Maps Universal Search feature. 
I wanted to also just highlight to you on the subject of Maps how we’ve been developing there. We’ve deployed Street View in 30 cities now, up 12 from the past quarter. Our new Street View API has got other sites integrating Street View with them. 
We are also at the same as we are spending a lot of effort collecting this data ourselves from Apps, we’re including user contributed data. In fact, we now allow users to correct information about local entities and locations on their maps. In fact you can see recent changes as they happen right now if you go to maps.google.com/recentedits.
I also want to quickly highlight that we have been working on difficult queries, the challenging ones and we had a substantial initiative over this past quarter where we were able to make a very large improvement in what we consider the hardest 20% of our queries. That was a big achievement and it really stands out in my mind.
Finally, let me just tell you a little bit of our progress on Mobile, because more and more people are accessing our Search and other services through mobile devices. We’ve now launched a much faster Search experience and it’s now available in Mobile in 40 languages. Our Mobile Search traffic, as a result, and just due to market growth, is growing very rapidly. That’s for Search, but actually across other properties also, we’ve now launched a new version of our YouTube mobile site and mobile users now can access the entire library of videos. If  you remember in the past it was a subset because there was little bit of delay in transcoding, but now all the videos are available. We’ve had mobile playbacks increase tremendously. 
We also just wanted to highlight that we’re pleased with our participation in the recent 700 megahertz spectrum auction; I know we did not come back within any spectrum wins in that but I feel this has been an important experience for us and we are also very pleased with the results that winners will be adopting these great open access concepts that I think will benefit consumers and developers alike. 
Anyhow, those are the highlights in Search and Apps and mobile. Now Larry, over to you
Larry Page
Thank you, Sergey. I’m very excited about the quarter as well and I’m going to talk to you a little bit about ads and applications. So, in ads we did a bunch of things in the last quarter. One of the main areas was AdSense where we made improvements for both publishers and advertisers. We launched Google Ad Manager for Publishers, which helps publishers make their entire inventory available on the AdSense network. In testing, publishers greatly increased their revenue with this, so we are really excited about it. 
We also launched demographic targeting on social networks which uses gender and age information from over 30 social networks to help advertisers place ads.
Now switching gears to AdWords, one of the things we launched was a tool that gives customer’s better control and more data and those things are the Conversion Optimizer which we first launched in 3Q07. We are now seeing really rapid adoption across our advertiser base. What that Conversion Optimizer does is let the customers bid per customer conversion rather than per click. You can pay basically when someone buys something rather than when someone clicks something. 
As you can imagine, that really lets people optimize a lot better and we’re really excited about getting wider and wider adoption of that and it has really been taking off like we had hoped.
In Analytics we’ve added industry benchmarking. Google Analytics, if you don’t know what it is, lets you track visitors to your website and your overall traffic and how you are doing, and so on. Industry benchmarking is a  new feature we launched so you can tell how you’re doing against others in your same industry, and that’s been a very popular feature.  We find that Analytics’ customers, people who adopt Google Analytics, really just end up increasing their advertising spend with us as they better understand their metrics. 
Now let me switch gears and talk about YouTube. YouTube obviously we are very excited about, it keeps growing extremely fast. We are up to about ten hours of video uploaded every minute on YouTube. So you can imagine just the rate of that is incredible. 
We have in-video ads, which have great adoption on YouTube and customers are increasing the size of their campaigns. We’ve now launched AdSense for videos, so now these in-video ads can run on sites besides YouTube and they may perform very well; we are seeing much better click-through ads than banner ads and that’s a really big deal and we’re really excited about that.
Now we completed our acquisition of DoubleClick and we’re very, very excited about that. They are a technology and networking partner, a tremendous asset and we’re very excited about what we can do together. We’re working on combining our ad network with DoubleClick display ad management products. Together that really helps publishers and advertisers generate more revenue, and we can put much more richer and diverse content on the Internet. So, I think there are huge opportunities there and we’re very excited about how thing are going so far.
Now in Apps, I will switch gears to Apps, we launched Google sites which is based on the JobSpot Technology we acquired and makes it easy for anyone to create and manage a website. It makes it easy to add an entry as Wiki. We use it for teams, projects, companies, schools and we’re already seeing a lot of interest in that. 
We also rolled out Offline Docs using a new browser technology Google Gears where you get offline access to your Google Docs.  I think people assume with this cloud applications they’re really great, they are easy to run with, no installation of software they but you wouldn’t be able to run them offline. We have a great new technology Google Gears as I mentioned that lets you run these new web applications even when you are not connected to the Internet.  I think that’s a very big deal. 
We’re also very excited about our Salesforce.com partnership. Salesforce has integrated our Google Apps products into Salesforce. Now their users have a very seamless, nice access to Google Apps within their Salesforce.com experience. We are very, very excited about that, as they are, as well.
Finally I just want to mention a quick note on our culture. We were really proud to win Fortune’s Best Place to Work Award for two years in a row. This is an amazing honor to have, I don’t think we expected it, but it is a really great thing. We’re also tops on Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies List. So we work very hard to maintain the best possible environment for our employees and I think that’s part of why you see the results that you do out of Google. 
Now I will go to Eric. 
Eric Schmidt 
Thank you very much, Larry. Why don’t we go ahead and go to your questions and comments. We are very interested in your thoughts on the quarter and any other insights you all might have. Krista, shall we get started?
Krista Bessinger
Yes, operator, we are ready to go ahead and queue-up for questions.
 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question from Ben Schachter - UBS Securities.
Ben Schachter - UBS Securities

Guys, congratulations on a nice quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the key initiatives at DoubleClick? What are the areas of integration that you think will be most difficult?
Related to that, if you could just give us an update on display and video ads and what types of ads you think are performing better and worse than expected? Finally, any update on the CFO search?  Thanks.
Eric Schmidt
Ben, on the CFO search we are very pleased that George has remained and is doing a great job, of course. We have a whole bunch of interesting candidates that we are reasonably close to. We have not made any offers yet and again, it’s an important position for us to fill but we’re very hopeful in the short term. 
We also have the benefit of having Omid and Jonathan joining us as usual. Omid, do you want to answer the DoubleClick questions to get started, and Jonathan maybe he can help you?
Omid Kordestani

Sure. We are just going through a very complete analysis of all the products and salesforce and service activities. Fundamentally we are looking at maintaining the customer momentum that DoubleClick has had and benefited from. Looking at, in a simple way, how do we get more of the advertising into their network and more of their publishers benefiting from the advertising systems and infrastructure that we are assembling together now. 
The overall goal here is basically bringing more effectiveness, more accountability more measurements that we’ve been asked for to deliver on. This process in fact was exhaustively reviewed yesterday and there is a strategy in place and you’ll hear of their product announcements in the coming months.
From a customer relationship standpoint, on the display side we are very, very active in taking advantage of our properties, especially YouTube and the content network to increase the customer engagements. Just this past quarter, I can just name a few of these names which I think will indicate to you perhaps the nature of how we’re utilizing the salesforce to reach significant types of customers that we haven’t had as advertisers before: Nature Valley, an incredible campaign through YouTube, utilizing everything from the contest platform, brand channel, Contest Gadgets, the content network, FeedBurner so the complete host of our products. Other names like Forex which used CPC placement targeting; Toyota, we actually even had the World Economic Forum at Davos using the YouTube platform; Dunkin’ Donuts, VeriSign. So quite a diversity of advertisers now that we are working with through this integrated relationship across all the properties.
Jonathan Rosenberg

Thanks Omid. Hi Ben, it’s Jonathan. In terms of display and the type of ads that are doing well, if you think about it from a big picture perspective, we really feel we’re in a position to become the world’s largest display ads provider. Over 90% of the daily impressions that we have are eligible for display ads and pretty much all of the publishers accept our new format. The gadget and the rich media creative which are served by third parties are pretty much all being adopted by folks. 
I think that the biggest thing that we are seeing that Omid alluded to in terms of the examples is the concept of an advertiser owning a concept across the entire web and finding their whole audience. Another example is Activision.  I think they use seven Google products to support the launch of the Tony Hawks Proving Ground Game and Search, AFC, the YouTube homepage and I think the in-video format is working particularly well. The one thing I would also add there is they are creating traction on mobile ads.
Operator

Your next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch

Thanks, two quick questions. First could you talk about your display model? Do you really see yourself being able to make really interesting profitability on network sites or do you plan to maybe put some display advertising on your own websites, which appear to be growing quite rapidly?  
The second question may be for George, just the other cost of revenue growth is really about 80% if I back out some of the stock-based comp. I am just wondering what’s driving that, and is that YouTube related at all?  
Eric Schmidt
Jonathan and Sergey, maybe you want to talk a little bit about display and how we are going to use it in our network in our own sites?
Sergey Brin

This is Sergey. Just real quickly, I mean there are certainly already sites that are Google-owned sites that run display such as YouTube, for example, is a very obviously prominent one. It has a lot of inventory and obviously that’s going beyond traditional display with the in-video kinds of ads that Jonathan mentioned. 
I think there are some other Google properties that might be good fits though we haven’t made clear decisions; I mean obviously more visual sites like Orkut there is some potential in Google Images but we don’t have any specific plans to announce today in that respect. 
I also think that we are certainly making progress on display in our network also and so I’m pretty optimistic on both fronts.
Jonathan Rosenberg

The only thing I would add to that is now that we have got the DoubleClick acquisition behind us, we will also offer the AdSense sites a media planning tool integrated with Dart for Advertisers by DoubleClick. I think you’ll see that will substantially increase the lift that we are getting there.
Eric Schmidt
George did you want to answer the second question?
George Reyes

The driver that you are alluding to is basically driven by data center related expenses, the associated depreciation that comes with that and bandwidth costs as well as some DoubleClick amortization.
Operator

Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers.
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers

Thank you very much for taking my question. You mentioned 100 quality improvements were implemented during the quarter. Can you talk about the degree to which you’re already getting the price per click benefit and whether that’s up to your expectations thus far?  
Also, do you still stand by your previous view that Google really isn’t seeing any impact from the macro situation?  Thank you.
Eric Schmidt

On the macro side, we look at this really carefully and we do not see an impact as of this time. We’ve also had the internal conversation of, what would happen if it were to occur? Our conclusion is that we’re well positioned should economics change to continue to do well because our model is so targeted. Targeted advertising does well in pretty much most scenarios, we think. 
Sergey or Jonathan, do you want to talk a little bit about the other?
Sergey Brin
 
Let me just mention, the 100 search quality improvements I mentioned were to the search quality. I wasn’t referring to the advertising quality experience. But we’ve also made improvements there, of course. If you recall the clickable backgrounds that we eliminated recently which while they reduced clicks a little bit increased the quality of clicks, and I think our advertisers certainly appreciate that. 
But there are likewise -- I don’t know the exact number -- but there are certainly dozens, if not 100 improvements in advertising quality that we also launched over this quarter. That’s going to benefit advertisers and it’s going to benefit end users who are going to see more relevant, interesting advertising and obviously because those connections can be more fruitful, ultimately that benefits publishers as well.
Jonathan Rosenberg
 
Are you asking about what the specific ads quality improvements were or are you asking whether or not the scope, the degree to which the scope impacted pricing and RPM, what specifically are you asking about the quality?
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers

Well, obviously, as much as you are willing to share Jon. Honestly I am asking which quality improvements on the advertising side would you say have had the biggest benefits thus far?
Jonathan Rosenberg
 
Sure.
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers

Are they driving price per click, to the degree to which you expected them too?
Jonathan Rosenberg
 
Sure, quality improvements intra quarter, so Sergey mentioned there were quite a few. I think they were relatively fewer in terms of impact in the quarter than we typically have. I think that was primarily not due to the number but it was due to the fact that more of them came relatively late in the quarter compared to previous quarters. 
I think the biggest ones that we alluded to publicly that Sergey did mention are the landing page quality improvements; we’ve removed a lot of the need for ad pages so there has been substantial improvements there. There also have been some policy changes, the visible and final URL policy matching so that users always know where they end up when they’re clicking on an ad which we think in the long run is very positive. I think we also announced the change in the UK trademarks policy so that we now removed the restrictions on ads on trademark keywords in the UK, which is the way that we had it to-date. These are all things that are great for users. 
I think that UK piece isn’t going to go live until Q2 so I am not sure it had much impact in the quarter. But the one other thing that I saw, some folks have noticed was just a very modest test which was our automatic matching beta test and that’s basically trying to extend an advertiser campaign’s reach by finding ads on relevant searches that aren’t triggered by the advertiser’s keyword. But that’s really relatively modest because that’s just an initial test that we just started. 
Eric Schmidt
Just to add one more clarification. We often don’t know the exact improvement that we are going to see in the very short term so at least from my perspective, I’m more concerned that the improvements be put in place and that they work well and then of course we’ll get the benefit as the advertiser see those and as the network takes advantage of it. We can take the long view of that. 
Operator

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citi.
Mark Mahaney - Citi

I wanted to ask Sergey about some of the mobile data points. Are there enough data points, do you have enough experience particularly in the international markets now to know what the economics of mobile search could like relative to the PC search? Are the leads being generated off of mobile devices as qualified -- more so or less so? Are advertisers willing to pay more or less for that?
I wanted to ask another question on the paid clicks. 20% year-over-year growth is obviously much better than was feared. There still is a pretty clear level of deceleration in the paid click growth on a year-over-year basis even if you trend line it going back a year-and-a-half. Part of that must be due to your quality initiatives. Do you think about it terms of trying to get to a paid click growth at a certain anniversarying of these paid click quality improvements whereby that growth will remain in the 20% or low double-digit rate at a more sustainable basis because of these quality improvements?  Thank you.
Eric Schmidt
Sergey do you want to talk about mobile?
Sergey Brin

On mobile, I don’t how the hard stats in front of me right this very second. I can tell you kind of anecdotally what I’ve seen in the countries and markets where mobile has developed in the sense that devices have high resolution, networks have low latency, the experience works which basically like Japan and a few others that are up and coming, the mobile search and ads work very well. 
I don’t have the exact data in front of me right now, as I said, but there is certainly nothing to dissuade me that it would be substantially worse than traditional desktop search. 
I think that if you look in the US and Europe which are a little bit behind those but I think are progressing, I think you’ll increasingly a greater volume and a greater quality of mobile usage and consequently advertising conversion ultimately. 
Now, you have a significant challenge in mobile in that the screens are much smaller so you just can’t go displaying nearly as much advertising or take as much space. On the other hand, you have much more relevant and timely information like what location the person might be in and so that on balance leaves me quite optimistic.
Eric Schmidt
The short answer to your deceleration question is the answer is no. We look at the problem of paid clicks as one of the components of an overall quality improvement. We know that if we can improve aggregate quality we know that the value of a click, number of clicks and so forth will grow, and will grow at whatever the technology will allow. So if you look, our absolute growth rate has been very, very significant and we’re very, very optimistic that this model of staying focused on quality will give us not only the strongest ad network but a much broader set of solutions for advertisers and it works well.

Your next question comes from James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs.
James Mitchell - Goldman Sachs

Great, thank you very much for taking the question. One question was with regard to the user response to Universal Search in non-US territories, have you rolled it out? In particular, why do you think Universal Search can help you gain share in those countries where you are not the market leader and where the incumbent lacks comparable functionality?
The other question, I was just looking back over the past few quarters, I believe you stated your business was less seasonally affected in the summer months in 2007 than in prior years. Do you think that something is structurally changing your business to reduce seasonality or do you think that 2007 was erratic in someway?  
Eric Schmidt
On the seasonality I’m not sure I agree with that characterization. There are so many variables that have to do with product improvements, product launches, customer deals, renewing and change in TAC rates, all of those kinds of things, it’s very difficult to say that looking at an aggregate number, in particular a change in seasonal growth rate, was a very big deal. 
We know there is a seasonality in the business; it’s very difficult for us to know exactly where it is. As you correctly pointed out, Q2 and Q3 are traditionally weaker quarters and my guess is that that will be simply true because the majority of Internet users are still in the Northern Hemisphere which is where people tend to take summer vacations. 
Sergey, do you want to talk about Universal Search?
Sergey Brin

On the Universal Search I think Universal Search is a very big win from the point of view of the Search experience. Now in some of these international markets like if you look at Korea in fact the local competitors there do have something that’s very much akin to Universal Search. So in fact I think the people’s expectations there are already to have Universal Search results and so its not necessarily something new we are introducing to them there.  I think our ability to rank and bring in these diverse corpuses that we have will surprise people and they will be impressed by how good it is.
In other markets you are right, I think that these additional corpuses and our ability to blend is a substantial distinction and I think we are going to benefit from that in fact and obviously we have lots of international or foreign language videos and images and so forth and we have a certain number of books as well in there.  I think we are going to benefit from all that hard work that we’ve put in those corpuses.
Jonathan Rosenberg

This is Jonathan adding one narrow point and one broad point on your question about seasonality. Narrowly within each quarter, there are things that make one year significantly different from another; this year you had Easter falling actual in Q1 whereas in previous years it has fallen in Q2. On the other hand offsetting that this year you had a leap year which in this year was actually on a Friday although since it added one more day in the quarter, the net results of leap year was giving us one more Monday in the quarter. When you think about that, that actually equates to something in the ballpark of about 1%. 
The broader question in terms of the business moving forward with respect to seasonality is highly dependent on market share. In many markets if you look historically we were gaining share and in some cases in previous years that’s significantly masked seasonality. In markets where we have very, very high share then the business starts become, it starts to look more seasonal in nature than it has in the past.

Your next question comes from Imran Khan - JP Morgan.
Imran Khan - JP Morgan

Larry, you talked about a monetization improvement for social networking, how you are doing more demographic targeting. Could you please give us some color like what kind of progress you made monetizing social networking compared to Q4?  
The second question is regarding how you’re improving the search quality in the international market. Can you give us some sense in terms of the frequency of search in your lesser developed countries like Continental Europe compared to more developed like US and UK, the frequency of search volume per person?  Thank you.
Larry Page

On social networking monetization, I think its been an area where we have really applied a lot of new technologies and then some of the demographic targeting and so on, which has been very successful. I think the challenge and the opportunity there is there is a huge amount of inventory. We have obviously MySpace, Orkut, Inner Network and a number of other social networks. There is a lot of usage of those. So there is a tremendous amount of inventory and so part of it is just getting that advertiser ecosystem built up and people targeting that inventory and doing it in a way that makes sense for those advertisers. 
So I think we’ve made a lot of improvements and I’m optimistic that there are improvements to be made. That’s balanced against tremendous inventory levels in those areas which it takes some time for advertisers to really realize they are there and start targeting effectively.
Sergey Brin

This is Sergey. I don’t think we consider Continental Europe less developed. I do think that in the advertising space, we have seen that they are sort of coming up on the ramps that the US and UK might have been a year or two ago. So that obviously gives us great opportunity for growth advertising-wise. 
But in terms of basic Internet usage and searches per user, while once again I don’t have the data in front of me, what we’ve seen is it typically just depends on broadband penetration and quality of broadband and the more people have access to great networks and computers to use them the more searches and overall internet usage they will do. That’s why you see this skew during the week, that Monday to Friday we do tend to get a lot more usage than on weekends. Obviously part of that’s because people are relaxing off the Internet on weekends, but part of it also is that typically often people at home don’t have as good connectivity and Internet access as they do at the office.

Your next question comes from Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners.
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners

You mentioned in the UK that travel and finance has rebounded, I was just wondering if you could discuss travel, finance and hopefully retail more broadly across the US and some of your other geographies in terms of strength or any relative weakness?
The second question is should Yahoo! choose to outsource part of Search to you, I was wondering if you can discuss philosophically what the benefit would be to Google’s own property in the sense that you have a broader, deeper ad network, broader advertising if you will, coming to the site? 
Eric Schmidt
On the Yahoo! question we are very excited to be participating in this test, at the beginning of the second week on the test.  I don’t think it’s really appropriate to speculate beyond that but its nice to be working with Yahoo! and we like them very much. Omid, do you want to answer the UK question, or Jonathan?
Omid Kordestani

We will both probably take this on. I mean in general what we are seeing is that these verticals really behave by region as you are indicating, and they are the factors that determine for example in each geography we have talked about this in the past, renewal rates for finance or travel reservations that get done in UK drive those verticals. 
I think, in general we saw in Q1 a bit of a slowdown in retail, some postponement of budgets but we haven’t seen anything that kind of significantly indicates to us that one vertical or another is at risk here. We are just going deeper into these accounts, and in some cases when the budgets are delayed its made up by other online categories.
Jonathan Rosenberg

I think if you think about what economists would typically theorize in a macroeconomic climate that was slowing they look at sectors like some of the ones you’ve mentioned – automotive, luxury goods, we also track travel and finance -- and you look for the ones that are more sensitive to macro-economic conditions, and look to see what’s going on with them.
What we tend to see is that clicks in some of those sensitive areas do grow a little less rapidly than our overall growth so the share of their total queries is actually down but on an absolute basis, they are all showing healthy growth in ad revenue. 
In the UK, for example, people are clicking on travel and local ads at a higher rate than they do in the US. In finance, although certain components of finance are down, foreclosures are up and even more mortgages do pretty well, if you think about foreclosures, every foreclosure at some point becomes a home sale and a mortgage to somebody. 
So generally what we are seeing is absolute growth even in those areas that are otherwise adversely impacted by macroeconomic conditions.
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners

You’re basically indicating that you tend to see price improvements in these areas as the conversions continue?
Jonathan Rosenberg
It varies. 
Eric Schmidt
I think the best way to say it is that it’s possible that prices grow up in that situation simply because of the great value of targeted advertising.

Brian Pitz - BoA Securities

Can you talk about how much of your international growth is really due to the sunsetting of European best practice funding?  
Separately, would you provide any updates on China and perhaps discuss any new initiatives that Kai-Fu Lee and team may be working on over there?  Thanks.
Eric Schmidt
Sorry, could you repeat the second question?
Brian Pitz - BoA Securities

Sure, just updates on China and the team Kai-Fu Lee, things that they’re working on over there, some new initiatives we may not have heard about?

Your next question comes from Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets.
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets

Great, thanks for taking my question guys. Looking at the US growth rate of 30% approximately in the first quarter, if you had to characterize your small, medium-sized self sign-up advertisers versus your large agency or direct enterprise-sized advertisers, which segment was growing faster in the quarter relative to that 30%?  Thanks.
Eric Schmidt
Again, I’m sorry we had a phone problem here. Could you just repeat the substance of the question again?
Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets

Sure. The growth rate in the U.S. is 30 % year over year. If you had to characterize which area was growing faster between the small to medium-sized self-signup advertisers on your platform versus the larger agency or direct enterprise type clients, which was the faster growing segment in the quarter?  
Omid Kordestani

I don’t have the actual breakdown in front of me right now. What I will say is we are doing very interesting collaboration between both of our channels; in fact, in some regions we have three with some resellers involved. One of the things we tend to do is just try to put our relationships with the customers into the right channels. So in many cases where we find that we can in a very effective way service our clients through our online organization we do that and that organization in fact has top-tier clients now that are even some brand names that are well-served by our organization. 
What we’re trying to do with the direct sales organization is really focus on those higher-end calls into the C-level if you will, to the CMO level where also we are presenting the full suite of products and integrated campaigns between YouTube. In the US obviously we’re also experimenting with a lot of the new initiatives from TV, radio, advertising, and so perhaps on a follow-up call we can get you more specific stats on the different geographies and the ratios between those two channels. 
But, there is a lot of movement of customers that we do again to optimize the relationship with the customers.
Jonathan Rosenberg

Just trying to add little more to color to Omid. We definitely tend to see that it is the larger customers that are the bigger drivers of growth, whether or not on a relative basis in the previous year they were bigger drivers I think is unclear. But we have released a lot of tools like Analytics and the Conversion Optimizer and those are the type of things that tend to get adopted disproportionately by the larger, more sophisticated advertisers and we do see that as advertisers adopt those tools it substantially fuels growth. So there certainly is significant growth with the larger advertisers.

Your next question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse.
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse

You mentioned that you are seeing much better click-throughs on the overlay ads versus your normal banner ad. By our measure, we’re only seeing running overlay ads running on content where you have clear relationships like the NBA and Universal Music. What are the barriers to running ads on a broader spectrum of YouTube’s inventory, particularly the user generated content that you’ve got?
Omid Kordestani

What we’re really focused on right now is working with YouTube management channel team to really actually go from the, if you will the plumbing, and work all the way up with the customer’s advertiser fee; there is a lot of integration work going on.  YouTube was already a large DoubleClick customer and we are trying to basically streamline how the integration of DoubleClick and YouTube can be improved and how we can take advantage of our ad networks so that more of these advertisers could be represented. 
How do we work with the owners of content, user-generated or otherwise, to actually find the right match-up with the right advertiser so if we basically have a much better targeting of ads and also promotion of the right types of content. 
So it’s a very comprehensive plan that we have put in place. We have a 2008 plan that has a very specific milestones again all the way from the systems and infrastructure that we need to provide that integration all the way to the different types of ads. 
I think it’s very early to make any kind of a judgment about which ads are working well and which ones are that we’re really trying to have these integrated campaigns, try it out with the salesforce and our customers and do a lot of learning and settle in to a product roadmap. 
Eric Schmidt
Thank you. Let’s have a couple more questions. It looks like we missed a question so maybe we could get that caller to call back in as well. Operator, let’s go ahead, next question.

Your next question comes from David Joseph - Morgan Stanley.
David Joseph - Morgan Stanley

As you integrate DoubleClick into AdSense should we expect that to be a growth driver in addition to contextual ads or is it possible that it actually starts to cannibalize contextual advertising?  
Also, how is Google Ad Manager going to coexist with the DoubleClick Technology or ad serving technology?  
Also, should we assume that obviously DoubleClick is running AdSense revenue from here on out?  Thank you.
Omid Kordestani

In terms of the DoubleClick products, we really are optimistic that where we are headed to is where our Head of Sales in the US, Tim Armstrong, calls the CMO dashboard. What our hope is that by basically providing the integration across the board here we end up having in a simple way again a lot of DoubleClick access more towards advertisers and having the DoubleClick advertisers have access to the AdSense network. 
That’s our goal and so we’re really hoping that all of this will be incremental and that ultimately we get to a point where the CMOs can have a very effective way to measure the effectiveness of the advertisers and do the right allocation of their ad budgets across the board here.
Eric Schmidt
Jon, did you want to add anything to that?
Jonathan Rosenberg
 
I think the only obvious thing to add is that adding more display creates more competition among advertisers; we’ll have more premium inventory from publishers and those things will certainly be added to fuel each other. We certainly don’t think [inaudible] ads are going to result in any kind of cannibalization. 
There is plenty of reasons to believe that they are positive dynamics and its unclear that there are any negative ones.

Your next question comes from Brian Pitz - BOA Securities.
Eric Schmidt
Thanks, Brian. It appears as though we didn’t hear your question because there was a phone problem so I apologize. Maybe you could ask your question again, and we will restart up.
Brian Pitz - BoA Securities

Sure, no problem. I’m just wondering how much of your international growth was due to the sunsetting of the European best practices funding that you guys had talked about before. 
Separately, you mentioned 90% of impressions are eligible for display. Can you talk about the effective CPM difference between display and formats versus text links on your network?  Thanks.
Eric Schmidt
On the first question, Omid, do you want to talk about --  could you repeat your China question for me?
Brian Pitz - BoA Securities

Just an update on China. We just wanted to get a sense for any new initiatives the company was working on over in China, there have been some articles out.
Eric Schmidt
Let me give you a sense on the China situation. We are seeing market share growth and good revenue growth as we have learned to operate in that environment. Although the advertising business is nascent in China, the fact of the matter is that the Chinese Internet is so large that even on a small basis the numbers add up to quite significant with good growth rate. We believe that China will continue to be a good market for us. As we hopefully gain share we have significant new products for the Chinese, Knowledge Chinese, Users Chinese Language, Chinese Search and that’s our core growth, so the message there is good. 
Omid, do you want to talk about the international?
Omid Kordestani

Yeah on the ETS really it was something we announced a while back and our goal really is to have a very successful relationship with agencies across the world. We just felt that the previous program and actually the goal of the program is really to reward the way we engage properly together in servicing advertisers and also going after these new initiatives. 
The real performance in Europe comes from the great work that the European team is doing and really understanding the dynamics of the business, putting the right customers in the right channels in each region really understanding the dynamics of each industry vertical that we are selling into and paying attention to the seasonality effects and where to put the resources and servicing and selling clients.
 On the CPM and CPC question really our goal there is simply to allow again the advertisers to pay the way they wish between the display products and the text products. Ultimately the goal here is to focus on conversions for them so how they can best measure and achieve their campaign objectives.
Eric Schmidt
Jonathan do you want to talk about display?
Jonathan Rosenberg

The question specifically related to content and display and the dynamics in terms of how they interact and how that works and how that’s going?
Brian Pitz - BoA Securities
It was more along the lines of just the effect of CPM difference between display formats and text links on the network. 
Jonathan Rosenberg

I mean basically what we are doing is we are trying to come up with a way to manage the auction so that you can have the display ads competing with the text ads and multiple text ads basically in the auction have to compete in such a manner that they trump the value of the display ads. So typically three text ads versus one display ad unit. We’re still basically working through that. So that’s basically how it works, I am not quite sure what else you were asking.
Eric Schmidt
Why don’t we go ahead and get our last question. Thank you very much, Brian.
Brian Pitz - BoA Securities

Your next question comes from Mark May - Needham & Company.
Mark May - Needham & Company

My question is focused on the US revenues which grew $29 million sequentially. If one could make an estimate of DoubleClick’s contribution, one might conclude that the US revenues were flat to maybe up, marginally, sequentially. Eric I think earlier you said you’re not really seeing a meaningful impact on the business from the macroeconomic environment. I think it was also mentioned that the majority of these search quality improvements occurred outside the US. 
So the question is, is the sequential growth that you put up this quarter which is far lower than what it has been in the past, is that more a reflection of where we are in the search cycle, search out cycle in the US or given that it’s not really macroeconomic… that would be great.
Eric Schmidt

Well we know what it’s not. We know that it is not macroeconomic. It can have as much to do with the timing of deals, partner activity, the timing of product rollouts and the maturity as you pointed out of the US market; also the rate at which both search quality improvements play out within the quarter as well as advertising quality, because again they don’t necessarily implement exactly linearly in the quarter across every geography. 
Jonathan, do you want to add any perspective to that?
Jonathan Rosenberg

I think the only obvious thing to look at is you have to be very careful when you look at the annualized year-over-year comparisons to try to isolate the impact in a quarter. The biggest thing that you would separate out there from the US relative to international, is that in the base quarter that you are comparing to which would be this quarter of last year we added a lot of really big partners in Q1 of last year  to AdSense and so relative to that year this year we didn’t have that many incremental partners to add so I think that’s everything else being constant otherwise leading you to see what appears to be a relative reduction in the US. 
But it’s primarily a factor of that. There is also the AdSense for domains cleanup, which we talked about earlier.
Eric Schmidt
And my guess is that the two that Jonathan described are the primary cause and we have to go back and really match it all to be sure. 
Let’s finish up by saying first thank you very much for everybody spending -- your time is valuable, spending more than an hour listening to us and talking about Google. 
I also wanted to take a minute to thank Omid for something, I don’t Omid if you remember but right after I started here I told you to go get on an airplane and go build some international operations. You flew to London and the rest is history. This is the quarter where we are now 51% international revenue.  I don’t think that percentage is going to go down; the world is a very big place. Congratulations to our international sales teams, the international leadership for making Google a truly global company. 
Thank you all.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/72846-google-inc-q1-2008-earnings-call-transcript

Good day and welcome, everyone, to the Google Inc. Conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Krista Bessinger. Please go ahead, Madam.
Krista Bessinger
Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to today’s third quarter 2007 earnings conference call. With us are: Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer; George Reyes, Chief Financial Officer; Larry Page, Founder and President of Products; Sergey Brin, Founder and President of Technology; Jonathan Rosenberg,  Senior Vice President of Product Management; and Omid Kordestani, Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Operations.
Eric, George, Larry, and Sergey will provide their thoughts on the quarter and then Jonathan and Omid will join us for Q&A.
Please note that this call is being webcast from our investor relations website. Our press release, issued a few minutes ago, is also posted on the website, along with the slides that accompany today’s prepared remarks.
A replay of this call will also be available on our investor relations website in a few hours.
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our investments, seasonality, traffic acquisition costs, increase in the cost of sales, international growth, operating margins, growth in headcount, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
Please refer to our SEC filings, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, as well as our earnings press release posted a few minutes ago for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the investor relations section of our website.
Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call, such as EPS, net income, operating margin, and operating income, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock-based compensation. We’ve also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow.
Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release on our website.
With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Eric.
Eric E. Schmidt
Thank you very much, Krista and in looking at 2007, we are very, very pleased with our year and also with the quarter that’s just ended. If you look at 2007, a strong financial performance across the board, reflecting a performance and a focus here at Google on both growth and profitability, with of course very strong revenue, operating income, and earnings. 
I want to call out strong international growth. More than half of our search traffic is now outside the United States, more than 150 domains and still growing. The international market is still very nascent with tremendous potential for what we could do over time. 
And of course, the model at Google about product improvements and innovation continues. Hundreds of search quality launches, greater advertiser control and transparency, obviously higher ROI as a result, lots of new ads formats, YouTube video ads, from example, contests, branded channels. 
We’re working hard, by the way, to promote open mobile and developer platforms and we’re completing an application suite, [inaudible] integration, presentations, et cetera, and in concert with both product and international focus, we have a global team. We now have offices in more than 20 countries. We are working on having a local presence across global markets and this global local focus is reflected both in our organization and our products and in the way we run the company. 
Of course in Q4, a solid quarter without a question, pleased with traffic growth across the board even in the relatively mature markets which is always exciting. And obviously we are very happy with gross revenue on both google.com and on our AdSense partners. 
I think we are going to have Larry and Sergey take you through product highlights. My emphasis area is search, infrastructure investments, things we don’t talk that much about, leading to improved quality as seen by end users that we can measure, and of course giving advertisers more control as the product matures and obviously, as a result, improving their return on investment. 
The APP strategy, which we announced earlier in the year, now fully visible -- more innovation, data portability, all the apps now either in place or coming and mobile, which we are very excited with Android, the My Location service as part of Maps and many other new features that are both out and coming. 
So we are optimistic about 2008. We have growing revenue streams across a broad range of verticals and markets. As I mentioned, this international market which is central to our global rule, still relatively nascent with a tremendous potential. Ad dollars continuing to move from offline to online, a trend which is not going to reverse, and of course our ability to use our strong position in markets in order to essentially offer more services to end users and get people even more to see the new benefits of the new Internet world. 
So with that, rather than me talking about more of the details, why don’t we hear from George and then Larry and Sergey on some of the amazing things that have been happening. George. 
George Reyes
Thanks, Eric and good afternoon, everyone. At a high level, we had another strong quarter, with gross revenue increasing 51% over Q4 of 2006 to $4.8 billion. Our google.com properties increased 58% year over year, reflecting strong traffic growth during the holiday retail season and, to a lesser extent, monetization growth. 
AdSense revenue grew 37% over Q4 of 2006, driven by particularly solid performance among our AdSense research partners, including e-commerce and search partners. Offsetting this growth was the impact of a quality improvement to AdSense for content. This changed the clickable area around the text-based ads to only the title and URL, reducing the number of accidental clicks and increasing advertiser ROI. 
Now let’s look at aggregate paid clicks growth. Aggregate paid clicks includes clicks related to ads served on Google properties, as well as ads served on partner sits. Aggregate paid clicks grew approximately 30% over Q4 of 2006 and approximately 9% over Q3. 
Let me now discuss our international performance. International revenue increased to $2.3 billion, or 48% of revenue in Q4. Revenue in the U.K. grew 5% this quarter to $692 million, reflecting the usual Q4 seasonal slowdown in the finance and travel verticals. 
Revenue growth in EMEA was primarily driven by a strong performance in France and Germany, where gains were made in the retail, technology, and finance verticals. 
We also saw solid gains in relatively smaller markets, such as Canada, Ireland, Spain, and the Nordics. Asia and Latin America continue to show impressive growth rates as well, with Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and China being notable performers in the quarter. 
Now turning to expenses, traffic acquisition costs were $1.4 billion, or roughly 30.3% of total advertising revenue, down 40 basis points year over year but up from 29.1% in Q3. The increase in overall TAC rate was primarily related to the performance of a few AdSense partner sites, for which we are required to make guaranteed payments. We have found that social networking inventory is not monetizing as well as expected. 
AdSense TAC was $1.3 billion, while TAC related to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our websites totaled $125 million in the quarter. 
Turning to other costs of revenue, which includes $6 million in stock-based compensation, increased $75 million over Q3 to $516 million. The largest driver of the increase was the increase in costs related to our data centers, including depreciation, equipment, and operations. We continue to anticipate that other cost of sales could increase going forward. 
Other than cost of revenues, operating expenses in Q4 totaled $1.4 billion, including approximately $239 million stock-based compensation. Expenses related to payroll and facilities increased $97 million to $756 million. At the end of the quarter, we had a full-time employee base of 16,805 employees. We added 889 employees in Q4, with over half the new hires being in engineering, followed by sales and marketing. 
We have implemented and continue to follow a disciplined hiring process in all areas of our organization. Hiring in Q4 tends to be slower due to the holidays but as we’ve indicated in the past, we will continue to invest in our core business, both in the U.S. and internationally. 
Turning to non-GAAP operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation, increased to $1.7 billion in Q4, with non-GAAP operating margins of 35%, compared to 36% in Q3. The sequential decrease in margins was driven primarily by the increase in overall TAC, as discussed earlier. As we have said before, margins may decline in the future as we continue to make ongoing investments in our business. 
Turning to tax, our effective tax rate for Q4 was 25%. Our Q4 rate was more favorably impacted by an R&D tax credit in Q4 compared to Q3 as a result of stock option activity. This was the primary driver of the difference in tax rates between Q3 and Q4. 
And finally, turning to cash, operating cash flow remained strong at $1.7 billion, with CapEx for the quarter of $678 million. As in previous quarters, the majority of our CapEx was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data center construction, production of servers, and networking equipment. We expect to continue to make these significant investments in CapEx in future quarters. 
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure which we define as cash flow from operations less CapEx, was also strong at $1 billion. 
So in summary, we believe our results reflect the strength of our core business across our three primary initiatives -- search, ads, and apps, with disciplined investments that position us very well to capitalize on the long-term opportunities we see for Google. 
With that, I would like to turn the conversation over to Larry. 
Lawrence Page
Thank you, George. I’m really excited to tell you about some key new things that we did in both search and advertising. So to begin with in search, we had over 100 launches in Q4 with focus on our internationalization and investing in our quality. 
One of those was universal search, which is now available in 15 languages, up six in Q4. We also launched the universal navigation bar in all languages, which gives our users easier access to all of our Google properties. And book results are now blended in all domains. 
We also made some behind the scenes infrastructure improvements to improve our quality, and the biggest of those was increased index size, which really improved relevancy, especially for non-English results. We also had substantial improvements in latency and freshness, particularly in Europe, Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. 
Now, we also made it easier for webmasters to make their site searchable. There’s two things there. The first was webmaster tools. We have several million sites now using and actually doubled our user base over last year, and that basically lets webmasters easily tell what’s being crawled from their site and what’s being indexed and so forth. And we added a bunch of new features to that in Q4. 
We also have our site maps product, which is another tool to let webmasters make their sites easier to crawl and we added Florida, District of Columbia, and U.K. National Archives, among many other sites, and added many, many thousands of pages there. 
Now in ads, that’s obviously where we get a large portion of our revenue. We launched some key features there that really drove performance for advertisers and really helped us gain traction. 
First of those in AdWords was call the AdWords Conversion Optimizer, which we launched in early January and that lets customers big by specifying a cost per acquisition rather than a cost per click. So for example, you could pay only when someone actually buys something rather than just when someone clicks on your ads. 
AdWords actually, the system actually optimizes their click-based bids to approximate that cost per acquisition for each auction, and that’s really gotten strong adoption, particularly among our larger clients and we’re really excited about that. That really improves the advertiser return on investment. That gives them more conversions which is really what they care about when they actually make money at a lower cost per conversion. 
In AdSense, we also launched cost-per-click on placement targeted campaigns, such as campaigns that are on a particular website. And this got really strong adoption and it really helped drive better performance and increased spend for our [directory] advertisers, so we are really excited about that too. 
Now I’m going to turn it over to Sergey. 
Sergey Brin
Thanks, Larry. I want to talk to you about some of our relatively newer initiatives. I want to start with Google Apps and related products. G-mail -- G-mail launched an important new infrastructure in Q4 and this has really increased performance. For those of you who are G-mail users, you may have noticed how it loads a little bit snappier, you can switch between conversations a little bit faster. It’s really improved my productivity and I hope you see that as well.
In addition to that, this new infrastructure has really made development easier and in fact, we were able after that to launch eight new features within a span of eight weeks. 
A couple of new features that also makes G-mail more open, we’ve added IMAP support, so you can use all of your favorite e-mail clients, including, of course, devices like the iPhone and you don’t have to use POP3 anymore, you can now use IMAP, which is the better way to go, if you have the choice. 
You can also now chat with AOL instant messaging users, so this is great now in the Google chat little screen in G-mail. You can connect not just to other Google Talk users but also AIM users, which is a really large population. 
I want to jump now from G-mail to YouTube. YouTube has continued to have a really strong user growth. In fact, we had a few special events that just demonstrate this. We hosted the CNN Republican debate together with CNN and in fact, almost as many people saw it on YouTube as did on CNN. We consider this a great milestone and we hope to continue to do great partnerships with CNN and others to jointly grow audience for events. 
We also, I should mention that YouTube is now available in 17 languages, eight more than last quarter, and so we are seeing a lot of international growth. We are really excited about that. 
In enterprise, we’ve gotten a lot of increased interest, trial, and adoption of Google Apps in larger companies. First of all, we’ve signed an agreement with Taylor Woodrow, which is the construction services division of Taylor Wimpey, a FTSE 100 company in the U.K. We are also finalizing an agreement to deploy Google Apps at Genentech, and those are just a couple of the really big ones we have. We are talking to many, many companies and many are adopting it all the time. 
In addition, the universities that have deployed this quarter includes the University of Southern California, the North Carolina Greensboro, Florida International, and Clemson. 
Now jumping a little bit aside in mobile, we’ve really been revving the Google Maps for mobile, among other applications, and Google Maps is just really useful on your cell-phone now. Some of you might have seen our launch of the My Location, which allows you to see where you are on your cell-phone even if you do not have a GPS-enabled phone, and that’s really amazing. In fact, even if you have a GPS in your phone, the My Location can give you a first cut much faster than you can usually get a GPS signal, and it will work indoors. 
I was just using this, I was at a conference in Switzerland, I was able to find a really small hotel and then even switch over to the satellite view on my phone to figure out that I needed to take a vernicular to get up there.  It was just a really amazing experience and we continue to add features and reliability to it all the time. 
I should mention My Location is available now in 21 countries and it works on four different platforms altogether. 
We also launched a new rev of apps for the iPhone. We call it Grand Prix internally, but basically you get access that’s really fast and integrated to the major Google products, including search, G-mail, calendar reader, and others. And it’s really had great uptake. I use it personally myself. Many people have really been enjoying this product. It’s growing very rapidly. 
Last but not least, I’m going to do a shout out to Android, which is the operating system that we are developing for mobile phones, and it’s completely open, of course. It’s going to really solve a lot of the challenges the company’s in the mobile industry have. We’ve released the SDK for it. We formed the Open Handset Alliance, which has now 34 industry leaders in it, and we really think that this is going to make Internet on mobile hopefully as frictionless as it is on your desktop normal Internet experience. This is going to spawn lots more activity and what we love, it’s to see lots of great, open access to the Internet wherever and whenever you are. 
Anyway, that’s what we’ve been doing on those fronts and now, back to you, Eric. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Well, thank you very much, George, Larry, Sergey. As you can see, not only did we have a very good 2007 but we are quite optimistic about ’08 and our model continues to work very well. 
Why don’t we go ahead and move to your questions and I would also like to bring in Omid and Jonathan, previously introduced, to help us answer your questions on this or anything else. So could we go ahead and get our first question?
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions)  We’ll take our first question from Imran Khan from J.P. Morgan.
Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan
Two questions; first of all, paid click growth rate declined 15 percentage points sequentially year over year, growth rate, so I’m trying to understand how much of that growth rate decline was due to the changes you made and if you see any improvement in the price-per-click because of increased customers return on investment, because your year-over-year revenue growth rate decelerated 10 points as well on your website, so to better understand the relationship between price-per-click and paid clicks growth rate. 
And secondly, social network monetization is difficult. You talked about that and I believe it’s with News Corp that you signed a long-term contract, so how should we think about that contract and what does that mean for your TAC rate going forward? Thank you. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Why don’t we start with Jonathan? Why don’t you take the first part of Imran’s question?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure, Imran. Basically paid click growth, which you referred to, tracks the traffic growth rate and the traffic growth rate did decelerate. The number of search ads basically grew faster than the number of content ads, so I think one of the things that you have to look at there is what is the mix issue. And then I think there were probably some secondary factors there. Some factors would include things like the focus that we’ve had on weeding out the low CPC, high click-thru rate low quality advertiser, so that’s probably a component. 
The other thing that we did was there was probably some impact from the non-clickable backgrounds which we launched on AdSense for content, so those were probably the biggest things. 
I think there was also a little bit of an issue with the timing of the holiday. Monday and Tuesday were Christmas and Christmas Eve, which are conventionally our biggest days, so that was probably a component.
On the CPC side, generally CPCs have been going up, click-thru rates have been going up, and coverage has been going down. I’m not sure I could add much more there. 
Sergey Brin
I just wanted to follow-up on the social networking question. We don’t talk about individual partners’ performance or anything like that. Now I do want to highlight though, we have had a challenge in Q4 with social networking inventory as a whole and some of the monetization work we were doing there didn’t pan out as well as we had hoped. But we are continuing the efforts and we are still optimistic about future quarters. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Douglas Anmuth from Lehman Brothers.
Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Thank you. My question is regarding the U.K. it looks like your growth Q2 was about 5% in the U.K. and that compares to about 11% in the fourth quarter of last year. Could you talk about what you are seeing there beyond the usual categories that you may see weakness in typically during 4Q and what you are seeing there from a macro perspective as well? Thank you. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Omid, do you want to go ahead and handle that?
Omid Kordestani
In general, we are very pleased with our performance in Europe. And actually, I know you asked about the U.K., but very quickly we are seeing great results in France and Germany as well in the retail category. I think in the U.K., we saw the typical seasonal patterns but we were -- there are certain categories that we believe the auction is in effect fully sold out and we are working on clever ideas and conversion analysis for our partners to really improve their understanding of how they should spend and how they should price their bids. 
But overall, we are very satisfied with the penetration we have with the major accounts. We are at CEOCM tables. I was there throughout Q4 and overall, we’ve seen a lot of strength in the market. 
Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
And are those two categories, travel and financial, that are typically seasonally weak? I mean, do you feel like there is an additional macro impact there?
Omid Kordestani
No, those two were the primary ones. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Jonathan, do you want to add anything to that?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I was just going to add that it was finance and travel. Maybe the only other point to look at there is if you look at the total percentage of advertising spend in the U.K., some of the public data says that it’s roughly 15%, 16%, 17% on search, whereas in the United States it’s more like 6%. So one of the things that you see there is that the seasonality, particularly in those two verticals, is much more marked because they are spending a disproportionately greater amount of money in total on search engine efforts. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Let’s go to our next question. 
Operator
We’ll go next to Jennifer Watson with Goldman Sachs.
Jennifer Watson - Goldman Sachs
Thank you. Can you give us a little bit more detail on the feedback that you are getting from both advertisers and consumers on the YouTube advertisements that you guys rolled out?
Eric E. Schmidt
Omid. 
Omid Kordestani
We were doing what I can best characterize as just a lot of touch points with our -- both publisher partners as well as advertisers. We are trying different formats. The in-video ads have been very successful. We’ve had a number of campaigns and the way we are also approaching this which I think is unique for Google is really from an integrated and scalable fashion. 
In the case of -- for example, if I may name some clients, General Motors, for example, Chevrolet Europe, we did what I think is a really truly possible with the advantage that Google has, you know, running the campaigns across multiple countries, delivering large numbers of impressions from YouTube to the content network to the search campaigns. Adobe, for example, ran one of the biggest homepage campaigns we’ve had in the history of YouTube. 
So all in all, we are doing a lot of experimentation. We are starting to do it globally and we are doing it in every integrated fashion and by adding the other key assets that we have. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Let me add a couple of other things. YouTube is doing extremely well, growing very, very quickly and doing so internationally as well as in the United States. There’s been an issue around standardizing ad formats for advertisers who would like to be able to do industry buys and so forth. 
So as these new ad formats are being developed, we are also looking to make sure they get standardized into a common buying pool and pattern so that people feel comfortable that they can get real value. 
The next generation of projects are actually very, very sophisticated ad products and it looks like they are going to do extremely well. 
Next question. 
Operator
We’ll go next -- 
Krista Bessinger
Operator?
Operator
We’ll go next to Mark Mahaney from Citigroup.
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about mobile, particularly for you, Eric. You’ve got a very interesting perspective from two companies on what’s happening with mobile Internet usage, particularly off the iPhones. How much of a ramp are you seeing? Is there any way you could quantify it and is there a way you think about how mobile search as a percentage of overall search could be in two to three years? Thank you. 
Eric E. Schmidt
It’s very difficult to estimate the percentage in a few years. We have already said in a number of public statements that it is growing significantly faster on a percentage basis than other categories, and as you mentioned, iPhone is the first of a whole generation of products that will be much more search intensive, and so there’s much more likely to be many more search opportunities and with those search opportunities comes ad monetization. 
We have done a number of deals for mobile devices already, KTTI and DoCoMo, for example. DoCoMo just announced by Omid in Japan, which are very, very strategic for us. 
It’s difficult to estimate what percentage it could ultimately be long term, and when I say long term, I mean perhaps 10 or 20 years. It’s reasonable to assume that a majority of searches would be on mobile or personal devices, simply because over a long enough period of time, they will take on the tremendous power that’s represented in the PC and Mac platform. And the wireless networks are getting to the point where they can offer performance similar to the wireline. 
Jonathan, do you want to add anything?
Jonathan Rosenberg
We’ve been tracking the data very carefully. We are particularly interested in looking at the iPhone, particularly because the experience on web browsing is so good and because of the optimization efforts which we did. We saw a very significant spike in December with the optimization that we did on both the iPhone and it was well over double I think within about a month in terms of increased usage. 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
If I can do a quick follow-up on macro trends -- to the extent that you would see weakness related to a softening consumer, do you think you would see it more on the supply or the demand side -- i.e. ad budgets being trimmed or less consumer commercially oriented searches? Thank you. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Sergey. 
Sergey Brin
We’ve been really studying these questions really in depth and near as we can tell, we just offer such a great ROI for advertisers that they can directly see and measures that advertisers in maybe even difficult markets and what not just have great incentive to get as much profitable inventory as they can from Google and the other different kinds of ROI advertising that we offer. 
So we have not been able to detect any such effects from macroeconomic trends. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Jonathan. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I think some of you have observed that direct marketing tends to be less affected by economic downturns than brand marketing, given a time measurability. I think that’s been true in past recessions. I think we’ll probably see that again. 
I think one thing we may see is consumers comparison shopping more and that would certainly create more clicks. It might create modestly lower conversion rates but we think overall, if people are doing more comparison shopping and looking for bargains, that’s probably positive. 
Clearly if there’s less overall commerce in the economy in general, then that could adversely impact overall demand, but we really think that relative to most organizations, we are pretty much tracking the diversity of the overall economy and search-based efforts will fare pretty well. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Let’s move to our next question. 
Operator
We’ll go next to  Christa Quarles from Thomas Weisel Partners.
Christa Sober Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
The main question I guess is on the C-block I guess passed the reserve price today. Obviously you can’t mention whether or not you are bidding, but can you just talk about what those open access measures ultimately mean for you, and especially with Verizon moving toward open access toward the end of 2008? And also, if you can kind of highlight your WiMax stance. 
And then a total separate quick question -- I was just wondering if you could give the impact on checkout to COGS in Q4. Thanks. 
Eric E. Schmidt
On the first part of the question, we’ve concluded we cannot answer any questions in that category because of legislative rules with respect to how the auction is working, so I’m afraid we’re going to only be able to answer the second question, so could you repeat it again?
Christa Sober Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
Well, can you make any comment on WiMax at all, with a separate -- 
Eric E. Schmidt
As I indicated, I think it’s best practice for us just to move to the second question. 
Christa Sober Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
The second question was just on Checkout and whether it had a big impact on the COGS in Q4. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Jonathan. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I think it’s the same answer that we’ve given in the previous calls -- the impact was immaterial. I think one of the strongest observations that I could give you there is that the organic growth in terms of Checkout overtook the promotion efforts this quarter, so I think that’s a good sign in terms of the general traction that we are getting. 
The other things that we are seeing there, that the click-thru rates on the [badge] are up as much as 10%, so I think that’s going pretty well. 
Sergey Brin
If I may, also in addition to the click-thru rates, I think we are starting to get some anecdotal and some actual real studies that demonstrate that the conversions are also up, very substantially and hopefully we’ll be able to share more of that with you in the coming weeks. But there is really good evidence now that Checkout is able to get consumers through the process more quickly and more reliably. 
Christa Sober Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
Okay. Thanks. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Why don’t we go ahead to our next question?
Operator
We’ll go next to Robert Peck from Bear Stearns.
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
As we think about the margin levels this quarter, should analysts be thinking that based on what you are seeing as far as the social networking side, is this more of a new run-rate level, or do you think the margins were somewhat suppressed by the MySpace relationship in Q4?
And then number two, could you also talk to us about timing of a DoubleClick closing and any sort of impact you can see to the numbers for 2008?
Eric E. Schmidt
Let me do the DoubleClick question. So everybody knows, we had FTC clearance in the United States in December, which is great, and we are working with the European Commission. We are obviously very hopeful that they will clear as well and that’s probably all we can really say about DoubleClick at this time, but we are certainly hopeful that it will get cleared. We are working with them pretty closely. George, did you want to answer the first question?
George Reyes
Bob, could you repeat the question again?
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
It’s really more of was the impact of social a one-time impact for 4Q or should we think about this as being more of a normalized EBITDA margin run-rate going forward, particularly as other projects continue to build -- 
George Reyes
We’re still in the learning stages of how we monetize social networking and this is going to evolve over a period of months, so this is sort of early stage at this point. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Any idea on a replacement for CFO?
George Reyes
Maybe. 
Eric E. Schmidt
We’ve got a number of very good candidates and we are very happy to have George is still doing the job here and has agreed to continue to do this until we find the right replacement and it’s a hard position to replace, given George’s incredible performance. Let’s go to our next question. 
Operator
We’ll go next to Benjamin Schachter from UBS.
Benjamin Schachter - UBS
A few questions; I was wondering if you could go into a little more detail on the social networking issues and specifically maybe talk about differences you are seeing with your non-text-based ads versus your text-based ads on social networking. 
And then another question on TAC associated with Google.com revenue. It continues to move higher, it’s about 4% now. I was wondering if you could talk about the key drivers and if there is a target rate internally for where that may go. 
And then finally, on healthcare, in the past, Sergey, I think you’ve specifically said that you don’t really think about Google's efforts in healthcare as really a driver for P&L and Eric, I know you are speaking at a healthcare conference in February. Any updates to that? Any change in how you are thinking about healthcare, how it might be a business opportunity? Thanks. 
Eric E. Schmidt
On the healthcare side, we don’t have any products to announce at this time, so why don’t we answer the first part of your question, Jonathan and Sergey -- social networking and TAC. 
Sergey Brin
I’m afraid I’m not sure off the bat what the stats were on the image versus text ads. We did have some changes relating to allowing certain kinds of CPC ads, which were only allowed to be bid on a CPM previously, which may have contributed to some cannibalization, or at least for now. 
But as I said, on the whole I’m not sure what the data is for image versus text. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I don’t have too much to add. We’ve certainly seen adoption of both the text and the image ads on social. I think the thing we have to figure out there is how to optimize the look and feel of the ads against the inventory that we have, how to slice the inventory up in alternative ways to try to figure out how to make it work and we’ve got some demos that we’ve just developed that are going to change the way we are doing some of the targeting, so I think we are basically going to have to look at that and try to figure out how do you find people of particular demographics that are comparable to what you might find in the New York Times or in a particular publication that you might have been previously familiar with. 
Sergey Brin
If I may summarize on the whole, we have a huge amount of social networking inventory, including the MySpace relationship, including of course Orkut, our own network, which is very, very successful and probably like 20 others, or something like that. I don’t know the exact number. But we have an incredible amount of this inventory and in fact, it varies quite a bit in how it all monetizes, based on a number of factors, some of which we understand, some of which we don’t. 
I don’t think we have the killer best way to advertise and monetize the social networks yet. We’re running lots of experiments. We had some significant improvements but as I said, some of the things we were working on in Q4 didn’t really pan out and there were some disappointments there. I hope to be able to report more progress in the future but it’s a big opportunity because it’s so much inventory. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Why don’t we move to our next question?
Operator
We’ll go next to Mary Meeker from Morgan Stanley.
Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley
Thanks. Dave and I wanted to revisit Imran’s question from the beginning of the call. Our worry going into the fourth quarter about Google was related to monetization levels, or cost-per-click growth, given what was going on in financial services, retail, and travel. We weren’t worried about query growth. Now you’ve reported your numbers and by our math, the cost-per-click growth was about 16%, so very robust, the highest we’ve seen in a long time, but by your math, the paid click growth was only about 9% sequentially in what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. 
And as we were thinking about it, just as we read in the press release before the call started, we thought issues might relate to the fact that it’s tougher to gain share, given how high your share already is, given there might be some share loss, issues about a recession, something geographic, or much slower market growth. 
And George mentioned then changes in the algorithm impacted, reduced accidental clicks. So our question, and it may be for George, is 9% sequential growth the kind of growth to potentially think about in the December quarter, or did the algorithm have a really material effect on the sequential query growth, or was it something else?
Eric E. Schmidt
Again, we have to be very careful here not to project any guidance here with all the math, so Sergey, do you want to try to describe what you thought the components of all of this were?
Sergey Brin
I should mention that we were reluctant to even start reporting that particular metric and it’s because unfortunately, there’s just a lot of complexity in our business and as we try to get the best possible, most useful ads to our end users, and hence get the most promising customers to our advertisers, we trade off a lot of things. So one example is the one that George mentioned, the one that you just talked about -- for example, getting rid of the clickable backgrounds. 
But there are also factors like we might want to reduce the number of low cost clicks, or perhaps low likelihood to convert clicks, in favor of a smaller number of higher quality clicks. There are many, many trade-offs that we make. 
So I just -- I would hesitate in inferring too much from just that one metric alone. 
Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley
But was some of the -- was the change or some of the unusual things that happened that related to what you just mentioned and what George mentioned, were they global and did they take place through most of the quarter, or were they U.S. based? And then I’m done. Thanks. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Jonathan. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I’m not sure to what degree I can separate out the international component. It certainly is true that prices rise as advertisers get higher conversion rates, particularly over the holidays, and Hal Varian posted a blog that sort of takes you through some of that. 
The other thing which I think you said which I’m pretty clear is not the case, we’re generally doing very well from a market share perspective domestically and internationally, so the trend there is almost uniformly a gain in market share. 
Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley
I guess the one last observation is given that the changes probably had impact throughout most of the quarter and were perhaps global, that potential slowdown could be -- it could be a blip. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Again, you’re using the term potential slowdown, which is not a term we have used on this call, so again that’s your view, not necessarily ours. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Mary, the click growth in the quarter beat our internal forecast. 
Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley
Yeah, and it was certainly strong. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Why don’t we move on? Thank you very much. Next question. 
Operator
We’ll go next to Sandeep Aggarwal from Oppenheimer.
Sandeep Aggarwal - Oppenheimer & Co.
Thanks. Two questions; one is can you talk about how you are viewing the partnerships you have with some of the big AdSense partners? And basically, it’s clear that you did see some impact in that -- acquisition cost because of the minimum guarantees. I just wanted to know how would you hedge that kind of situation going forward?
And secondly, George mentioned about investments which may drive down the margins. I just wanted to hear from you or get some sense of where these investments will be made -- will this be more of enhancing your existing products and infrastructure, or some new initiatives? Thank you. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Omid. 
Omid Kordestani
I’ll take the first part of the question. I think in relation to partnerships, we enter all of these with a view to having very successful [inaudible] before going to the partner, as well as ourselves. We would like to have very profitable deals. 
I think in certain areas, as we’ve been talking about social networking, we make bigger bets to be able to understand that space. We think that’s an important category. We have our own products in that space and we want to understand the monetization, which is again more challenging area for us to figure out, but we are confident given the innovation model that we have and the roadmap that we have that we’ll be able to perform better there. 
So our goal in all of these deals is to again make the proper levels of investment, proper levels of guarantees and over time, in areas that are newer to us, to understand them better and have better products. 
Lawrence Page
I was going to add we’ve had I think in many of these areas with great partners, we’ve had very significant improvements in monetization and social networking in different areas. And like Sergey mentioned, I think there’s large opportunities still there. There’s tremendous amounts of inventory and the monetization levels are relatively low compared to other things. And we’ve seen the ability to make significant gains, so we are very optimistic about those areas still. 
Sandeep Aggarwal - Oppenheimer & Co.
I’m sorry, what about the investments, future investments?
Eric E. Schmidt
You might want to repeat your question, because I’m not sure I agreed with the premise of your question. Go ahead. 
Sandeep Aggarwal - Oppenheimer & Co.
I just wanted to hear basically in terms of I -- basically if you can provide some color in terms of future investments. Are they going to be more focused in terms of the enhancements to the existing product portfolio and improving your infrastructure versus some of the new initiatives?
Eric E. Schmidt
Well, the general answer is that’s where we see big opportunities and our primary focus on investments is in fact in our core business, and you see the success we had in 2007 and in Q4, the vast majority of that was actually not in all the things that generates all the exciting new announcements that we are happy to talk about, but in investments in core search and core advertising globally, which I’m incredibly proud of. 
George, do you want to add anything on this?
George Reyes
So in terms of your comments around margins going forward, as you know we don’t give guidance. We are going to continue to higher the talented people that we always have. We are going to continue our investments in CapEx and we are going to be very careful around how we proceed with making investments. 
Sandeep Aggarwal - Oppenheimer & Co.
Thank you. 
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Brian Pitz from Bank of America.
Brian Pitz - Bank of America
Can you provide some additional color on why we observed more of a deceleration in Google AdWords versus AdSense? And maybe this is a point of clarification but I think we heard you say that quality changes were made to AdSense and in addition, our assumption is that it was the social networking revenue also falls in the AdSense bucket. And then just a quick second question to Larry on licensing revenue -- should we assume most of the increase is due to the Postini acquisition? And that’s it. Thanks. 
Eric E. Schmidt
Jonathan, AdSense and -- 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I think we’ve pretty much answered that with the discussion that we had earlier on the mix issues. I’m not sure I can offer you anymore color. We said that the Google.com traffic was stronger than our own internal expectations. We also -- if you look back at Q3, which I think we talked about on the call then, Q3 was a very, very good quarter, so if you are looking at the sequential growth rate, you are comparing it to a quarter in which we did disproportionately well, relative to what we’ve done in the past but I’m not sure how much color I can really give you there. 
Lawrence Page
Perhaps it is worth mentioning, I do believe that we include the social networking revenue within the AdSense for content bucket, which is within AdSense as a whole. And perhaps it’s worth [also a note on the side], it’s not necessarily a financial metric, but we have had great partnerships with these social networks now. We’ve now launched Open Social and we have now at least 20 partners on that. We have applications being developed so we have networks who are participating, so we are really excited about all the progress innovation there and even though Q4 for us was a little bit of a disappointment in terms of the kinds of improvements in monetization we were able to generate, that’s -- Q3 was fine for us in that light, as was Q2 and we are optimistic about the future. 
Eric E. Schmidt
And remember that the Google model is one of experimentation. We keep trying and we keep trying new ideas until we find the ones that really generate phenomenal ROI and not only do we go with them but they grow very quickly. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I didn’t want to miss your second question, it was about enterprise growth and Postini?
Brian Pitz - Bank of America
Yes. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
And what specifically were you looking for?
Brian Pitz - Bank of America
Well, should we assume that most of the growth in licensing was due to the Postini acquisition in the quarter?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I think we’ve had a lot of success to date with small businesses. We added a lot of ISPs, which tend to drive a lot of the traffic. We also pushed a lot of the education efforts, which I think had a pretty significant component. Beyond that, it’s hard to -- 
Eric E. Schmidt
The answer to your question is yes. It’s easier that way. Why don’t we go to our next question?
Operator
We’ll go next to Marianne Wolk from Susquehanna.
Marianne Wolk - Susquehanna 
Thanks. I wanted to focus back on the economy. Can I confirm that when you called the weakness in the U.K. related to travel and finance seasonal, that you have already seen the normal seasonal rebound here in January?
And then as a follow-up, a few retailers we actually spoke to in Q4 said that they increased their spending in online advertising as a way to bolster the slower offline sales. Have you noticed any counter-cyclicality in the business? Could a weaker economy actually accelerate the shift in ad dollars online?
Eric E. Schmidt
Again, you have a thesis here which we don’t necessarily agree with and in any case, we are not going to talk about the current quarter. We are talking about the quarter that ended in December. I’m happy to say that we have not yet seen any negative impact from the rumors of future recessions. We’ll see what happens. 
Sergey Brin
But if I may add, I do think that certainly like you’ve seen from several of your contacts, it makes a lot of sense for advertisers if they want to be careful about their spending and they want to make sure they are getting a good ROI, to use the exact kind of advertising that we are offering. I think that makes a lot of sense and I think lots of advertisers recognize that. 
Operator
We’ll go next to Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked, but one about your future -- when you think about revenue sources beyond search, what do you think your biggest opportunity is among software as a service -- video or display? Do you prioritize those? And do you think any of them could be material within the next two years?
Lawrence Page
I think it’s hard to prioritize the exact ones. I think we are making tremendous strides in apps, as we talked about. There’s tremendous -- those are of tremendous importance to people and we are also getting revenue from multiple sources there from advertising and from people paying for the service itself. 
And we’ve obviously seen tremendous growth in YouTube, which we already mentioned, which is great. I think we’ll be -- there’s going to be significant amounts of advertising there also. 
I’m pretty optimistic about all the new areas we are pursuing and the opportunities there will take -- you tend to underestimate the long term and overestimate the short term for any new thing and I think you want to be careful about that, but I’m very optimistic long-term. 
Eric E. Schmidt
There’s reasons to be optimistic about all the categories that you described. The display business is literally right in front of us and the DoubleClick acquisition is an essential part of that strategy, so we’ll see. But of course, we have a sales force that is perfectly capable of selling those, customers are purchasing those already, and it’s a market that would benefit from the kind of technology that Google can bring to market. 
In the case of YouTube, you have a huge forward opportunity just because of the scale of the audience, globalization and so forth, so to the degree that we can develop the ad formats that we describe, it again should become very significant -- exactly when is very difficult to predict. 
Some more questions?
Operator
We’ll take our next question from Heath Terry from Credit Suisse. 
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse
I was wondering if first you could update us on the local business and exactly where you are in continuing to try and attract advertisers to monetize the tremendous traffic that you’ve built within Google Maps, particularly what kind of progress that you’ve seen out of the local business referral model?
Eric E. Schmidt
Jonathan. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I guess the biggest thing that happened this last quarter was the Local Plus Box, which we launched I think in late November. Basically that was an improvement to the local ads on Google.com. I think it’s only available for the top ads but basically what happens is we show a plus box for the local ads and it expands and basically gives you the advertiser’s address, the phone number, a map, and this is the kind of thing that you’ll see us moving more towards as we try to make our efforts there and our ads more consistent with what is going on with universal search, convey as much information as we possibly can in the ad related to what happens if you click through to it and try to figure out how to capture the local opportunity. 
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse
Great, and on the local business referral program?
Omid Kordestani
We’re not breaking any of those components out now. We are right now really focused on getting the right content, as Jonathan mentioned. A lot of the success of these areas will depend on having the most comprehensive listings and the right format and we are experimenting with all that, building the right relationships, and it’s still kind of early for us to break it out and really talk about the revenue performance. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
The one other thing that you could look at is I also believe that we have pretty much completely revamped the regional targeting system and how that works for the advertisers, and I would expect that there will be significant improvement from that as well. 
Krista Bessinger
We have time for just one more question.
Operator
We’ll go next to Jeffrey Lindsay from Sanford Bernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay - Sanford Bernstein
We’d like to ask two things. First of all, could you give us any breakdown of the 889 new staff, geographically and/or by function?
And then second, it looks like the TAC rate increased in the fourth quarter to 88%. Why did the TAC rate go up? What were the drivers behind this and were they one-off factors or were they factors that you expect would continue? Thank you. 
Eric E. Schmidt
On the hiring question, the first part of your question, you’ll remember that we hired a little ahead of ourselves maybe six months ago, so we’ve returned to our normal hiring process -- more international over time, a balance -- maybe 50-50, or close to it, technical and non-technical. 
We are a very difficult place to get a job at and so we continue to look to the very, very top talent in each and every position, and we do that worldwide and it’s working very well. And I don’t think any of that is going to change. I think that model for hiring and building the organization has worked for us for many years and I think it will continue. 
George Reyes
Our TAC rate is not 88%. We are looking at TAC as if it were a percentage of advertising revenue, which is roughly 30%. So as we’ve said, primarily this is all related to our AdSense partner sites and that’s -- which is where we are required to make the guaranteed payments and social networking is also something that is coming online pretty strongly. 
Eric E. Schmidt
So with that, I want to thank everybody. Thank you, Krista, thank the Operator and thank all of you for spending so much time once again on your afternoon/evening covering Google and we look forward to talking to you in our next quarterly earnings call. Thank you very much.

With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Eric.
Eric E. Schmidt
Thank you very much, Krista and thank you all again forjoining us. We are very pleased with such strong results in what is seasonallyone of our weaker quarters.
When we look at it, revenue growth of course very healthy,both in google.com and also in our AdSense businesses. And the seasonalweakness in traffic was milder than we expected on google.com, which was a verypleasant surprise from our perspective. It is obvious to us that the searchquality investments that we are making are paying off, particularlyinternationally, as we do better and better in almost every country.
Along with that, of course, we are working on expanding ourbreadth of ads offering with all sorts of new types of ads -- gadget ads, videoads, others coming -- and each of these initiatives gives advertisers new andinteresting ways to build relationships with their customers.
So by building these deeper ad solutions, we really candeliver more value, especially in markets and industries where they’ve notreally had these kinds of tools before. These are highly measurable and ROIdriven campaigns and Sergey is going to talk a little bit more about this interms of the steps we are taking in ads.
Looking at it as search, ads, and apps, on the apps side, weare now seeing a massive transition to web-based cloud computing at a consumerand enterprise level. We talked about this for a while and we now see not onlythe progress but also the future products, both from Google and from the otherfolks in the industry to make this really happen.
In our case, of course, we launched the presentation productas well as closing Postini, which is central to our enterprise push.
We are really on the cusp of a world where everyone cancreate, share, collaborate and find their content in the cloud anytime andanywhere.
Before I turn it over to George for all I think the goodnews, let me say something about George. George announced his retirement. I’vehad the privilege of working with him from almost 20 years. I’m going toembarrass him now. And everything that I can think of financially that’shappened at Google has really had George in the middle, whether it’s goingpublic, building the infrastructure of a multi-billion corporation, our largecash position, the secondaries, the financing, very, very good investorrelationships, the openness that we are now seeking, the financial disciplinethat exists in the company and also amazingly, our ability to deal with Section404 and Sarbanes-Oxley -- all driven not just by George but people he broughtinto the company.
With that, George, and hopefully an even better introductionto come -- go ahead, George.
George Reyes
Thanks, Erik and good afternoon, everyone. We had a verystrong quarter across the board, with continued impressive growth in ourbusiness. Gross revenue increased 57% over last year to $4.2 billion. OurGoogle.com performance was strong at $2.7 billion, representing year-over-yearrevenue growth of 68% and a 10% increase over last quarter.
As was the case in Q2, Google.com traffic was stronger thanexpected, reflecting a milder, seasonal affect than we’ve experiencedhistorically. Consistent with past summers, we also saw strong growth inmonetization, supported in part by healthy pipeline quality improvements.
We are particularly pleased with our AdSense performance,which grew 8% over the second quarter and 40% over last year to $1.5 billion.Both the AdSense for content and AdSense for search businesses were strong aswe experienced continued increases in traffic and improved our ability tomonetize our newer partner relationships.
Let’s now take a look at aggregate paid clicks growth.Aggregate paid clicks include clicks related to ads served on Googleproperties, as well as ads served on our partner sites. Aggregate paid clicksgrew approximately 45% over Q3 of last year, and increased approximately 5%over Q2.
Let me now discuss our international performance.International revenue grew to just over $2 billion, or 48% of revenue. The U.K.reported revenues of $661 million, and 10% sequential growth, led by thestrength in the finance vertical. The region consisting of Belgium, TheNetherlands, and Luxembourg also experienced notable growth in Q3.
The travel vertical was a contributor of growth acrossFrance, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and helped drive monetization growth.
And in Asia and Latin America, where we are still buildingour presence and investing heavily, we continued to experience strong growthrates in countries such as Brazil, China, and Korea.
Let’s now turn to operating expenses. Traffic acquisitioncosts were $1.2 billion and 29% of total advertising revenue, down from 30% inQ2. AdSense TAC was $1.1 billion, while TAC related to distribution partnersand others who direct traffic to our website totaled $105 million in thequarter.
As we have discussed previously, as we grow our AdSensepartner network and embark upon new initiatives, we may see pressure on TACrates going forward.
Turning to other costs of revenue, other costs of revenueincreased $29 million over the prior quarter, primarily as a result ofincreases in costs related to our data centers, including depreciation,equipment, operations, content acquisition costs, data licensing fees, andamortization.
We anticipate that our cost of sales will continue toincrease going forward.
Let’s now turn to operating expenses. Operating expenses inQ3 other than cost of revenue included approximately $200 million ofstock-based compensation and totaled $1.3 billion.
Expenses related to payroll and facilities increased $34million to $659 million. During the quarter, we added 2,130 employees, themajority in engineering and sales and marketing. At the end of the quarter, wehad a full-time employee base of 15,916.
Consistent with previous years, a large portion of ourstarts in the third quarter were related to university hires. Approximately1,000 employees had accepted offers earlier in the year but started in Q3,after the end of the academic year.
Included also are approximately 300 employees from thePostini acquisition which closed in September. As we have previously discussed,we are continuing to take a careful look at how we can more efficientlyallocate resources across functions and globally.
Let’s now turn to non-GAAP operating profit, which excludesstock-based compensation.  This was $1.5billion with non-GAAP operating margins of 36%, up from 35% in Q2. As we havestated previously, margins may decline as we continue to make investments inour business.
Now, turning to cash, operating cash flow was $1.6 billionand CapEx for the quarter declined to $553 million. The majority of our CapExwas again related to IT infrastructure investments, including data center, construction,production of servers, and networking equipment. We intend to make similarinvestments going forward as we continue to build a global infrastructure andresources necessary to serve and improve our product for our users and ouradvertisers.
Lastly, free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure which we defineas cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased to $1.1 billion.
Now, we will turn it over to Larry for more comments on thequarter.
Lawrence Page
Thank you, George. I am really excited to talk to you alittle bit about search and our improving search quality this quarter. We had alot of improvements we made to search quality for users and markets outside ofNorth America and I am very excited about that. It’s a big part of our trafficand we launched several dozen search quality improvements in specificparticular international markets and we are especially happy with the resultsthat we had in Russia, Thailand, Japan and Arabic speaking markets.
In mobile search, our search traffic there increased bothdomestically and internationally and the mobile apps traffic is growing well,particularly in maps. YouTube also launched their public site to stream selectYouTube content to mobile devices, of course, sporting the [inaudible] edition,which we launched last quarter.
Mobile ads are really doing well, especially in Japan wherewe had strong revenue growth and we also launched mobile ads in Korea.
Let me tell you a little bit about our user experienceworldwide, and especially about personalization and some new features. iGoogle,which has just been growing tremendously, expanded up to 43 domains now. We’rereally excited about that.
We also made it easier for users to set up their homepage oniGoogle, and that increased retention and usage. I love looking at some ofthese -- the weather, even though in California isn’t such an issue for us,still good to know what’s happening, and I can very easily get that on myhomepage now.
The number of available gadgets are increasing significantlyand the developer ecosystem there is really growing.
Now in book search, we really increased funding of relevantbook results a lot this quarter, and we think that has a significant effect onimproving quality. Our book search index is also huge now. It’s over a millionbooks. You think about trying to stack those up on your desk, it would takequite a bit of space.
We also added several new partners there with a total of 27partners now involved in that product, and we introduced a number of newfeatures.
Now, let me switch gears and talk to you a little bit aboutmaps and Earth, our geographic products. In maps, we really opened up an [outlookAPI] that makes maps a  developmentplatform and it makes it easy for people to put their own functionality intomaps.
For example, you can get real estate listings just when youare looking at maps, or real time updates to gas prices or ski and snow reportsright on your Google maps provided by third parties.
In street view, which is a feature that lets you see a viewof a particular street or house or business, we added five cities in Q3 and sixmore just in the last week, so we are very excited about that. There’s a totalof now 15 major cities where you can see street level views of almost anywherein the city.
In Earth, last week we actually launched a YouTube videolayer on Earth. You can go to different areas and see videos users have postedabout that area, and I looked at a few from Brazil that are very interesting.And companies like the Hidden Bay Lodge in Ontario posted a fishing video aboutgoing fishing there, so we are very excited about too.
So I will turn it over to Sergey now to talk to us aboutprogress in ads and apps.
Sergey Brin
Thanks, Larry. I am really excited to tell you today whatwe’ve done over the past quarter in ads and apps. As you all know foradvertising, our real philosophy is to create win-win between advertisers andcustomers by presenting users with really relevant information which isinteresting to them that’s likely cause a transaction to commence, we arereally helping out both.
But it is also important that it is not just what we say,but we can actually prove it, and so measurements of our return on investmentand the ability to optimize the investment is really important for advertisers.
We have a lot of tools now available for advertisers to dothat but I want to highlight a couple of new ones and a couple of updates forthis quarter.
In beta testing right now, we have the conversion optimizerand this lets advertisers adopt an ROI driven financial model even more easilythan just going straight with a kind of a cost-per-click type bidding.Basically, clients specify, advertisers specify how much they want to pay for acustomer and then we automatically optimize for them in each auction how muchthey ought to be bidding in order to accomplish that goal.
We’ve also launched a new release of our website optimizer,and this is where advertisers can run and create these AB kind of splitexperiments. You know, they can change their website layouts, they canrearrange their content, and this is very important because there is tremendousvariance, even once you get a user on your website how likely are they toreally understand what they are seeing, how likely or how easy is it for themto use, and ultimately what percentage of those users do actually perform atransaction? And this was a really great way to optimize that, to make a reallybig difference in the business.
Next I want to talk about some new app formats that I amquite excited about. And this does not mean that really flashy, in-your-facestuff. For example, we’ve launched our gadget ads and this is a global betathat we are running now. And for gadget ads, you can actually put functionalityinto the advertisement so it is more than just something to look at and clickbut something you can really interact with.
We have a Nissan gadget ad running right now that lets youpunch in your zip code, you get local traffic. It’s fun for users, it helpsNissan build brand. We also have gadgets that are actually really function towhat the company does. For example, if you are trying to book a flight or whatnot, you can punch where you are flying from and to directly into the ad.Anyway, we really are excited about these.
Of course, you’ve probably heard about our in-video ads, aswell as the AdSense video units. So basically, instead of trying to dosomething, say a pre-rollout for video where you would have to watch acommercial before watching the video, that would really not make sense,especially the kinds of several minute type videos we typically show onproperties such as YouTube. It would be very distracting.
Instead, we have a really nice ad that shows up in thebottom 20% of the video that just overlays for a few seconds after the videostarts playing and in fact, the initial user response rates have -- well, theuser responses and feedback have been positive and we’ve had betterclick-through rates than we anticipated. So I’m very optimistic about this adformat and this is the kind of thing that we have to do when we develop new adprograms. You have to experiment with different kinds of things until you canactually find formats that really work for users and for advertisers.
The AdSense video units of course are -- the YouTube videoscan be embedded on sites in the AdSense network, and this certainly providesmore distribution for the videos. They allow us to have contextually targetedads in the video player and this creates this three-way revenue share, which isreally a win-win-win between the publisher, the video’s producer, and Google.
I also want to, just while on the subject of video ads, justmention TV ads, which we of course have been running now for a while. We’vereally been getting a lot of interest and bookings from advertisers. And theremarkable thing about television is, it’s surprising, but in fact of theoffline advertising, it’s the one that’s closest to Internet levelaccountability and we feel we can bring much greater ROI type accountability totelevision advertising, much as we’ve done online.
Let me take a moment to talk about apps and what we’ve beendoing there. We’ve been growing. We’ve been seeing a lot of adoption of certainapps for your domain, apps for your university. The University of Phoenix, which is up to about250,000 accounts now, students, faculty, employees and so forth; Northwesternis now offering it to all students, that’s on the educational front.
For companies, we have a partnership now with Capgemini,which integrates Google apps into their suite of offerings and then Capgeminiprovides the systems integration support. And we are really excited aboutworking with third parties like this because there are just so many greatcompanies in the enterprise space that really know how to work with thecustomers and can plug our technologies in where it makes the most sense.
We also closed the Postini acquisition and not only did weclose it, but we already have deployed some of the Postini functionality onGoogle apps for domain and this was just an automatic upgrade for our appscustomers.
Now, in the apps suite, we now have rounded it out a bit.For example, we launched Presentations, so you can create a presentation, youcan import one, edit them and share them, and what this basically means now,for my usage, whenever I get e-mails or I need to work with somebody onsomething, I don’t really have to leave the web browser. And for Presentations,it’s great because you want to collaborate on a presentation. If there’ssomething you’re presenting, you want to get ready ahead of time. You can also,as you are even watching a presentation, you can make comments on it and whatnot. You can even just go to the URL of the presentation as you are beingpresented to and page through it forward or backward without having to havereceived a large attachment or having a big printout or something like that.
It is really convenient and I think has the potential tochange how people really work together.
Now, these apps support a total of 27 languages now. Weadded six more this quarter, so it is a very international product and we aregetting adoption worldwide.
An important piece that we are working on has to do withoffline functionality because of course, you don’t want to just have access tothese things when you are on -- if you want it in an airplane, you want itsomewhere where you just don’t have Internet or your Internet connection goesdown or is flaky. And the Google Gears was launched in Q2 to address that. Ourreader, as you all know, is our first geared application, as we call it, andthe fact that it is very nice. I encourage all of you to try this product. Itis very fast. It obviously downloads all the items, so they are pre-fetched.They show up quickly.
But you can expect more and more of Google's applications toshow up in geared versions so that you can work untethered.
Anyhow, I’m very excited about the progress we’ve made onboth fronts. Thanks for your time and now back to Eric.
Eric E. Schmidt
Thanks a lot, Sergey and looking back at the quarter, it isobvious to us that our model continues to work very well. It is a systematicapproach that we have to innovation and the way in which the company isexecuting speaks for itself.
The strategy of search, ads, and apps seems to resonateperfectly with this worldwide transition, if you will, to the use of theInternet on many, many difference devices, so all very exciting from a Googleperspective and again, thank you for listening so long to us.
Why don’t we go ahead and get your questions and see whatpeople think? Krista.
Krista Bessinger
Operator, we would like to go ahead and poll for questions.
Question-and-AnswerSession

Operator
(Operator Instructions) We’ll take our first question fromImran Khan from J.P. Morgan.
Imran Khan - J.P.Morgan
Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions; numberone, if I look at your network revenue, Google network website revenue, thatimproved significantly in Q3 after being roughly flat in Q2. I was trying tobetter understand what is driving that growth.
Secondly, you have been working with MySpace for a while andto get a better sense of what you have learned, how monetizable these socialnetworking sites are out there and as these social networking sites engagementsare growing so quickly, are you concerned that that could be a point of entryon the web?
Eric E. Schmidt
Thank you very much for your question. When we look at thenetwork revenue, a lot of the benefit we think is simply coming from greatertraffic to our partners and then also strong monetization gains and the way ourad networks work.
Omid, can you give us some color on how the partners viewthis?
Omid Kordestani
Sure, Eric. We look at basically both seasonality of thepartners and their distribution strategy. Some of our partners benefited lastquarter from having greater distribution of their services through their ownefforts of syndicating their search and advertising or using our services, andwe have been ramping up partnerships in the UGC space and we’ve seen nicegrowth in that space from partners, like MySpace.
I’ll let Sergey maybe add to the monetization angle here.
Sergey Brin
We’ve been very pleased with our partnership with MySpace.We’ve been pleased with the advertising performance. It has been a lot of workand innovation, actually. I know you might not see it from kind of a the userinterface point of view that you see, but we are developing really newtechnologies and I think these social networks are going to require a differentkind of targeting technologies, difference concepts of advertising.
We’ve already made big strides. It’s obviously a challengebecause there is so much inventory, people can be distracted by very manydifferent things and it is very personal, so there are a lot of things thatmake it hard.
But our technology, our targeting, all those things areactually coming along very well and we are really happy. We view it as a greatopportunity. I mean, it is just so much more inventory that if done correctlycan create that kind of win-win I was talking about between advertisers andusers.
Operator
We’ll go next to Anthony Noto from Goldman Sachs.
Anthony Noto -Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. You talked on the call about iGoogleand the positive feedback you’ve gotten from user metrics and I was wonderingif you could comment a little bit about improving that product even further.It’s a great application to allow me to more efficiently use Google. I don’thave to enter in searches for all the information I want to have on a dailybasis.
And there’s two things I think that could make it a lotbetter, and the real root of my question is, is there a technology limitationto doing the following two things, or a legal limitation -- the first is other,pulling in other applications that are popular on in the Internet, specificallythose that have been written to Facebook and others. Second, you’ve also talkedabout advertising being a form of content and in many of the verticals that Ihave on iGoogle in my account, such as movies, would really benefit fromdisplay advertising as an additional form of information. So is there atechnology and/or legal or other considerations that have limited you puttingdisplay ads on a the page or pulling in other applications? Thank you.
Eric E. Schmidt
Thanks very much, Anthony, for your good productsuggestions. There are some legal limits as to what we could do. We obviouslyhave to get permission of the partner and content in so forth and so on. Thereis no intrinsic reason why the vision that you painted can’t occur and in fact,part of our developer strategy is to get people to build what we call iGoogleGadgets, and we encourage the site that you name and others to make themavailable.
We need to work with them. We obviously can’t do it withouttheir permission.
Jonathon, do you want to talk a little bit about the displayads?
Jonathan Rosenberg
In particular with respect to gadgets, Anthony, we arecertainly going to be offering a lot more functionality through the gadgets.The current focus with them really is the user experience. We’ve done somethings with themes which we think have been a pretty big success, but reallywhat we are trying to do is figure out how to integrate much of what we aredoing with iGoogle and also the concept of these gadget ads, which Sergeymentioned.
What is so powerful there is that the gadget ads just don’tserve up your simple brand impression. What they do is they get people toengage with the brand and then we can actually empirically measure the level ofengagement, which is much more powerful than the things people havetraditionally done with display.
One of the things that I would suggest you do, Sergeymentioned one of the gadget ads, the Nissan ad, I think if you type into Googleeither Honda gadget ad campaign or the Six Flags gadget ad campaign, you’ll getsome examples of some campaigns that have leveraged this technology to reallydeliver.
Eric E. Schmidt
Our next question.
Operator
We’ll go next to Benjamin Schachter from UBS.
Benjamin Schachter -UBS
If I’m reading the TAC rates right, it looks like thepartner TAC went down pretty meaningfully, and then the TAC associated withGoogle.com went up as a percentage of revenue. I’m wondering if you couldcomment on those trends.
Also, you mentioned in the prepared comments about the levelof accountability on TV ads. At a high level, can you talk about the learningsthat you are getting from targeting ads on the search side, how those will workwith both video and display, possibly offline and on? Thanks.
Eric E. Schmidt
Jonathon, do you want to talk about TV ads first?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure. I think TV ads could actually really beunderappreciated for the reason that you mentioned, in terms of our offlineefforts. This is really one of the few places where you can bring the same typeof Internet level accountability to offline advertising, so with searchadvertising, obviously our customers see real-time how their ads performed.
The same thing is really true with the feedback mechanismthat we get with set-top boxes. We are bringing the same level of granularityto the offline TV format. The trials that we have right now are with EchoStarand Astound Cable.
And what we are able to do there is we are able to show theadvertisers when their spot is playing and look at the viewing levels of usersactually during the course of the spot, so we are very excited about how thatis playing out and we think it bodes very, very well for our progress in TV.
Eric E. Schmidt
Why don’t we talk about TAC rates? George, do you want tostart that?
George Reyes
So our AdSense TAC went down slightly, but on the otherhand, Google.com TAC went up, and primarily driven by the partner mix.

Robert Peck - BearStearns
I had a question on future use of capital here, and as Ithink of any large expenditures going forward -- first of all, I was wonderingif maybe you could comment on Google's desire to maybe put a large investmentin Facebook or a large social network? And then I was wondering if maybe Larrycould talk about the importance of 700-megahertz going forward. I mean, itdoesn’t look like [inaudible] will probably codify what Google wants for the700-megahertz, so does it come to a point where Google has no choice to notonly put a token bid in but to also sort of bid to win, whether it be with aconsortium or what not?
Eric E. Schmidt
On the question about specific investments, as you know, Ican’t really comment on any specific investments. I want to assure you all thatthe cash isn’t -- it’s not burning a hole in our pockets. We don’t feel somegreat need to spend it right now for any particular reason. We would do aninvestment that is capitaled if we thought it was incredibly strategic. Many ofthe partners we’ve been able to work with, we’ve not needed to do such aninvestment. They are happy partnering with us simply because of our technologyand our ability to monetize.
Larry, do you want to comment about 700-megahertz?
Lawrence Page
Sure. I think we’ve been actually quite happy with theopenness provisions that have been put into the 700-megahertz auction, so Idisagree with your assertion there.
I think we have many, many different options available to usas a company, in terms of spectrum and connectivity for people in wireless andso forth, so I don’t think we feel like there’s any desperate need for us tohave to bid to win or anything like that. And again, the money is not burning ahole in our pockets.

First question is just around in the mobile side, we’restarting to see sort of a convergence among hardware, software and services,you know, a la Nokia’s bid for NAVTEQ. I was just wondering, do you feelcomfortable with your current position on just having applications and theubiquity that you can achieve in the distribution of those applications?
Secondly, I was just wondering if you could give us anupdate on when you think DoubleClick might get some clarification on when thatmight close. I guess the EU decision begins next week, but just an update therewould be great. Thanks.
Eric E. Schmidt
On the DoubleClick side, we are following all of theappropriate steps that are needed to get worldwide approval and we arecertainly optimistic. It would be I think premature for me to suggest anyparticular timing. I can tell you we have a pretty close working relationshipwith all the people who I think in my view responsibly are checking on doesthis make sense and so forth. But we believe it will ultimately result in avery good outcome for us.
On the mobile side, we have talked at some length about ourmobile application strategy. We are very happy with it. Mobile applications,there’s some evidence that we are becoming the leading mobile applicationsprovider, at least in certain segments, and the mobile story is a very strong onefor Google. It is also a great one for the world.
You see over and over again one company after anotherannouncing a new interesting mobile platform. We want to make sure that Googleand its technology is a part of each and every one of those platforms.

Mark Mahaney -Citigroup
First, congratulations to George for a job extremely welldone. Just to keep going on mobile, what I’m trying to figure out is how muchof the future investment requirements success for Google in mobile couldentail? And the setup here is you’ve obviously achieved a leading position as aPC search service without the need to develop a Google PC or a PC operatingsystem or an Internet access service with all the infrastructure requirementsthat that would entail.
Is there any reason that your success in the mobile Internetworld would require any similar type developments -- a Google phone, a mobilephone operating system, or a wireless access infrastructure with all of therequirements that that would entail?
Lawrence Page
I don’t think again that there’s a requirement to do anythings like that. I think Google, obviously we’ve grown a lot since we enteredthe search business and the opportunities that are available to us aredifferent, and there are opportunities for us available in those kinds ofspaces. And we would also love to get even greater numbers of people and wideraccess to our applications that we provide.
So I think that it is more of an opportunity for us then acost. We have tremendous usage of our current mobile applications and we havedeals with very, very many different wireless carriers and so on, and manyother types of carriers. I think those things will all continue.

Douglas Anmuth -Lehman Brothers
It looks like you added more than 2100 net headcount adds inthe quarter, which is significantly more than you added in Q2, despite beingmore focused on headcount. So even ex Postini, it looks like it is more than1800. So can you give us some color on the timing of your hires during 3Q andalso how we should think about this in relation to margins going forward? Thankyou.
Eric E. Schmidt
Obviously can’t talk about margins going forward. What wesaid last quarter, as you know, is that this is an area where we needed tospend some more time and focus more on what is the appropriate rate. And thegood news is we have done that. The numbers that you are seeing are essentiallyan overhang and they are an overhang from hiring that had been agreed to many,many months earlier. June, of course, is a major college hiring, universityhiring, professor hiring kind of a cycle, so I don’t know that that will berepeated.
The important thing here is that we did in fact correct andI think going forward, you should be comfortable that we are paying a lot ofattention to the headcount.

Justin Post - MerrillLynch
Thank you. The gap between your revenue growth, 57%, andyour sponsored click growth, has been maintained around 12%. Could you talkabout the drivers there, where you are in your monetization cycle? Do you havea pretty good pipeline of things coming forward?
And do you think things like YouTube and AdSense for contentcould actually grow that gap as we look out to next year?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I can maybe cover some of the monetization issues. We arecertainly very happy with the product upside that we achieved this quarter. Itwas really -- it really came out of over 20 quality and UI improvements that welaunched.
There were two very big things that we’ve talked aboutpublicly. The first was the reserve base promotion, and actually we onlylaunched that in late August, so it only had part of the quarter to manifestitself in terms of improvements, and that was basically the change to theformula which determines which ads are shown above the search results, so thatwas certainly significant.
We’ve also been doing some things like previous query basedad targeting, which is pretty significant. We’re looking at the previous queryto try to figure out what to do on the next query. So we’re pretty confidentthat we’ve got many, many more ad quality improvements like these.
We’re also launching them internationally prettyexpeditiously, so from that standpoint we think there is a very healthypipeline in ads improvements.

Brian Pitz - Bank ofAmerica
Your CPC growth rate accelerated from 7% last quarter to 8%this quarter. Can you provide any commentary on this, including is this drivenby your recent algorithm change?
Secondly, with respect to your ability to monetizesignificantly better than competitors, is there the possibility for TAC ratesto continue to come down, especially with respect to the upcoming renewal ofAsk.com? Thanks.
Eric E. Schmidt
Jonathan and Omid.
Jonathan Rosenberg
I’ll let Omid handle the Ask.com comment. Basically you aretalking about a 1% difference. CPC, as we’ve talked about in the past, islargely driven by mix, so I think if you looked at the monetization improvementsthat I mentioned, that is certainly a component of it but a large part of it isalso a mix issue. Summer does tend to be modestly higher from a CPCperspective. One of the things that we see is that there is a lot less academictraffic, which Google has disproportionate to most of the other players in themarket.
So with less non-monetizable traffic and modestly moremonetizable traffic, that is a mix that actually does play a role.
Omid Kordestani
We are going to I think enter a period where you will see alot of these fluctuations so it will be hard to predict. One is driven bypartner renewals, like the ones you mentioned where we obviously focus onpreserving our relationships with as many of our partners as possible,including Ask.
But the other thing that is going in parallel with thatobviously is increasing the quality of our network and our partners are alsoactively involved with distribution strategy of their services, like we are.
I think the mix of those effects is really hard to predict.We are trying to improve the quality overall, which will I think actuallyeliminate some growth in terms of distribution in the network. That’sunhealthy, in our opinion, for the network.
On the other hand, the renewal and improvements in monetizationreally drive up the monetization [efforts]. So that makes it hard to predict atthis point.
Jonathan Rosenberg
The one other thing I would add is that all of the adsquality efforts are very, very focused on eliminating a lot of the bad ads, andin particular, it’s a lot of the very bad ads which are low CPC, so one of thethings you will see is that as we improve ad quality, reducing coverage whichin general is what we’re doing, you will see the CPC increase because thoselousy ads are generally the nickel or thereabouts types of ads.

We’ll go next to Jeffrey Lindsay from Sanford Bernstein.
Jeffrey Lindsay -Sanford Bernstein
We would like to ask a little bit more about the 2100 newhires, or the 1800 after Postini. We noticed that a high proportion came insales. Could you possibly give us an indication of the geographic split forthese new hires, overseas versus domestic? And then, could you give us an indicationfor the rationale for the expansion of the sales force? And given that a lot ofyour sales are automated, wouldn’t expansion of the sales force be taking yourcost structure in the wrong direction?
Omid Kordestani
A couple of important factors in that, some of them youmentioned. First, we have been very focused in having the proper level ofpresence in every country that makes sense for us to have, both our partnershipteams as well as advertising sales teams that directly work with customers.
As you can imagine, in some of the emerging markets, forexample, both in Asia and in Europe, we’ve had actually early success withadvertisers working directly with our system through our online channel.However, you reach a point where local education are helping the efforts onmonetization with the clients. It requires the presence and what our focus hasbeen is to really push our field sales forces, our direct sales forces, toreally spend their time on the named accounts and also represent the full suiteof products that we have.
So one of the things we are trying to avoid is havingmultiple sales forces for the different products and services we have. Forexample, the YouTube activity; one of the great efforts we have done, both inNorth America and other regions, is to actually train the sales force andcombine effort so that our customers receive one voice and one representationfrom the company covering the majority of the products.
At the same time, what we are doing is paying a lot ofattention to cost per revenue dollar metrics and sales force productivity andputting the right customers in the right channels and mapping that with oursales organization where again, we balance the direct sales force that is inthe field versus the operations team and sales efforts that go on in our bigoperation centers in Dublin and in Argentina, in local countries in Asia and inIndia, which we have a major presence in.

We’ll go next to Youssef Squali from Jefferies.
Youssef Squali -Jefferies & Co.
Thank you very much. Can you talk about monetization on thevideo side and YouTube in particular? You’ve started syndicating that contentacross the ad network. When do you turn up the monetization dial on that? Is itan ’08 event? What’s preventing you from doing it now?
And secondly, I guess for Sergey, is it fair to assume thatyou’ve decided to go with ad overlays over a pre-roll and potentiallypost-rolls? Thanks.
Sergey Brin
Let me just take both of those. We’re certainly progressingon monetization for YouTube and what not, but that’s not the number onepriority for that property right now. We continue to grow the traffic andimprove the user experience. We continue to really improve the publisherexperience and also, we are working on things like the fingerprinting, which weannounced recently, which we have just really fantastic technology for.
On the advertising UI, we are very pleased with the overlaybut I don’t think we are ever going to say this is it from now on. We are goingto continue to test a variety of different formats.
When we started in UIs for advertising on search, were bythe way the little text ads, we were considered really crazy. I mean, it took along time to really perfect that to get advertisers to really understand it,learn it, and ramp the monetization. Here also I think we are in for along-term investment.

Heath Terry - CreditSuisse
Thank you. As you start broadening out your advertisingformats with your television relationships, YouTube, to what degree are yoursearch advertisers starting to manage these mediums from a single point ofcontact for you? And how far along are the more traditional branded advertisersin beginning to look at their Internet and traditional forms of advertisingalongside of each other when they are trying to evaluate the effectiveness ofthat advertising?
Omid Kordestani
We are actually spending a lot of time -- that’s a very goodquestion -- in terms of how we should focus on the core business and help alladvertisers, including the major Fortune companies and companies across theworld, really take advantage of search. That’s a proven model for us. We reallyunderstand a lot about it and that is something we -- the sales force spendsthe majority of their time doing at this point.
In these other areas, as Sergey mentioned, for example, weare really prioritizing in the case of YouTube the user experience but at thesame time, we are having great demand and interest in advertisers trying thesenew formats and working with us. So in the case of radio, TV, print, all ofthese are new initiatives. We are seeing a lot of interest. We are spendingtime on it and really trying to balance not losing focus on the core businessthat we really understand well and clearly works with the advertisers, as wellas getting interesting trials going, trying different formats.
So I think we are very confident in terms of the future ofthese formats, and especially the video, which is a great area of focus for us,as well as TV. I would say those two areas, you will see a lot of progress fromus in the coming quarters and search will continue to remain a very, verystrong focus.

James Friedland -Cowen and Co.
Thanks. I didn’t hear any comments on the call about GoogleCheckout, and now that we are heading into the holiday season, I just wanted tosee if we could get some commentary on what you are seeing in terms ofadoption, especially in the U.K. where you just launched.
Secondly, CapEx, while we expect it to continue to growquickly, has gone down sequentially and I was just wondering if you can commenton how it has been trending in the core search business in terms of ROIC. Onthat incremental dollar spend, are you getting better returns on your searchCapEx today than you were say 12 months ago? Thanks.
Sergey Brin
On Google Checkout, Google Checkout is continuing to grow.We are very excited about it. I personally use it all the time. We’ve beenadding a number of great merchants. Most recently, we added B&H, which happensto be my favorite camera equipment store. But we are adding many others aswell.
We are excited going into Q4 because we have -- it’s afairly young product and this time, we get to develop it further into theholiday season, so we are really excited about that one.
On your other question, I am going to turn it over to --
Jonathan Rosenberg
This is Jonathan. I caught the checkout part of thequestion. Maybe we can follow-up and get the second half. I just wanted tomention Sergey’s shopping experiences are too limited. We’ve got a big chunk oftop 500 merchants. In Q3, we launched PetSmart, Drugstore.com, Shoebuy.com, andthe NHL Store.
I think the real story that is important there is that manyof the advertisers that we are working with, such as Jockey, are reporting much,much higher click-through rates. They achieved as much as 60% higher withCheckout and they decreased the cost-per-click by over 31% with Google AdWordsand Google Checkout. So we are seeing much more significant volumes in terms ofsome of these advertisers and the performance with the advertisers.
I’m not sure I got the other half of your question.
James Friedland -Cowen and Co.
The other half was on the returns on invested capital onsearch CapEx, because CapEx has been trending down a little bit. It’s stillexpected to grow quickly but for that dollar spend on search CapEx a year agoversus today, are you seeing improved returns on your business?
Eric E. Schmidt
That’s a good question. We don’t actually use that metric inthe way you phrase it. What we are really trying to do is to invest the capitalof our shareholders as wisely as possible. As you know, we have built large andvery powerful data centers that are largely custom designed. Those data centersdo more than just search; they do advertising, they host apps, they do GoogleEarth and maps and so forth and so on.
We are quite comfortable that that investment, which wemonitor incredibly closely because it is, you know, millions of dollarsinvolved, really does translate into superior financial returns.
One way to think about this is that a year ago, people wouldask us about capital, why we were spending on this money on capital, and we’dsay we’ll get it. We’ll get it back in scale and in systems and so forth. Andyou are seeing the benefit of the investment a year ago. Hopefully you’ll seethe same investment return in the year for what we are doing today.

Thank you. Two questions and one, sorry, again, asking aquestion on mobile search, but I wanted to know if you can share what kind ofmix are you seeing in terms of a search query initiated by [mobile] versus PC,and if there is basically a trend you can share versus last year?
Secondly, you have completed one quarter with universalsearch. If you can make any comment in terms of what kind of improvement theend user has seen and what kind of benefits advertisers have realized? Thankyou.
Eric E. Schmidt
On the mobile search side, our mobile searches areincreasing rapidly compared to a year ago. They are growing more quickly thannon-mobile searches. They are still a very small percentage of total searches,which is of great frustration to us and we are working very, very hard withsome mobile operators to get Google Search to be as standard as possible onevery phone -- very quick and very responsive. Because we think the peopleusing phones really want to use Google to solve interesting informationproblems.
Jonathan, do you want to handle the second question?
Jonathan Rosenberg
The second question specifically on universal search, Ithink as you know we launched at the Searchology event back in around themiddle of May. We are very pleased with the increases in traffic which we sawthis summer, relative to the traditional seasonality. I am not sure that I canstatistically attribute the causality to universal search but certainly what weare seeing is very, very favorable feedback from users. We are seeing goodclick-through rates particularly, as Larry mentioned, with the betterintegration of pieces from different data sets like book search. So as we addmore books into the index and make it blend better, we certainly see higherclick-throughs.
So in terms of revealed user activity, what we are seeing isvery strong. Whether or not that is actually what drove growth is unclear. Ithink it is certainly a component.

Mark May - Needham& Company
Thanks for taking my question. It is increasingly clear thatin order to succeed long-term in the online marketing services space, that it’sbest to have a broad set of ad format capabilities. The question is can youprovide us with some data points that illustrate Google's current position inwhat I think is the largest of those, or one of the largest, which is brand ordisplay ads? And what are you doing to better your position there?
Omid Kordestani
I think at this point it is still early for us to be able toreally put any markers. What we are very busy with is just engaging thecustomers, training the sales force, trying these new formats, understandingwhich ones work best.
It is clear that the engagement model is of great interest,things like the gadget ads that we mentioned. The accountability and themeasurements, the kinds of things we are doing in TV that we discussed earlier-- all of those is very meaningful to the advertiser and there is greatinterest from them to participate in these trials we are doing and these testswe are doing.
I think we should be in a position to share more informationwith you in 2008 as we get more of these services out of beta, as well as signup more partners, more inventory and get the advertisers to have more spendingin these.
I think you’ll, as I mentioned earlier, I think you will seethat primarily happen initially in both TV and the video space for us.

We’ll go next to Jason Helfstein from CIBC World Markets.
JasonHelfstein - CIBC World Markets
Thanks. Two questions, one quick one and then fairly longer;are there any market share numbers or growth rates you can provide for Chinaand India?
And then my second question relates to the consolidation weare seeing of network guys by AOL and Yahoo!. It seems to us that that’s kindof a play on behavioral marketing. Do you have any concerns if they are notcareful, it might trigger privacy concerns for the industry and legislation orsomething we obviously don’t want to happen? And are there any discussions thatare going on perhaps at the industry or IAB level, so everyone is careful inthat regard? Thanks.
Eric E. Schmidt
On the growth rates in China and India, we are starting froma relatively smaller base in a number of other countries, and so the growthrates are quite significant. We would expect that to continue until they get tosome reasonably stable growth pattern. Both markets are growing quickly. Bothmarkets are under-penetrated in the Internet as a whole.
In China, as you know, we have a local competitor who hasmajority share. In India, it appears as though we have majority share. But inboth cases, it’s essentially an open field for all the players.
On the question of consolidation and some of the privacyconcerns, this is something that we spend a lot of time on and we are veryconcerned that the actions of the industry as a whole, people who are concernedabout what happens on the Internet could somehow affect us or really hurtconsumers.
From a Google perspective, we had done a number of things tothat respect. We have announced a whole bunch of policies around cookies andlog retention, which are innovative in the industry. As best we can tell, wehave the most aggressive privacy policy of any of the key players in theindustry today.
But we are also working very hard with government relationsteams all around the world to try to get people to understand what it reallymeans to have people using the Internet all day and the various conflicts thatare inherent there.
From a Google perspective, our ultimate success is based onthe happiness, satisfaction and excitement of end users. I can tell you that anend user is not going to come to Google if they don’t trust us. To the ultimatecheck, if you will, on a company like Google, is the fact that we are aconsumer company, primarily, and the consumers are free to choose and if theybelieve that Google is a poor quality company with respect to their privacy,they are not going to use Google. They are going to use somebody else.
So it is very much a fundamental part of our businessstrategy not only to promote privacy but also to encourage everyone to take itvery seriously.
With that, it looks like we’ve run out of time. I wanted tomake sure that everybody knew that we are having our financial analyst meetingnext week and we are looking forward to all of you who can attend in personcoming, and of course, you’re invited. And those of you who cannot attend inperson, of course there will be a full webcast and everything will be availableonline, as you would expect.

Good afternoon. Welcome to our second quarter 2007 earnings call. On the call with us today are Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer; George Reyes, Chief Financial Officer; Larry Page, Founder and President of Products; Sergey Brin, Founder and President of Technology; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of Product Management, and Omid Kordestani, Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Operations. Eric, George, Larry and Sergey will provide some thoughts on the quarter, and then we will have Jonathan and Omid join us for your questions. 
This call is being webcast from our investor relations website. Our press release, issued a few minutes ago, is now posted on our website, as well as presentation slides that will accompany today's prepared remarks. A replay of this call will be available within a few hours. 
Some of the comments we will make today are forward looking, including statements regarding our investments in our business; seasonality; our traffic acquisition costs (NYSE:TAC); increases in cost of sales; plans to continue to invest in personalization; international growth; growth in our headcount and expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. 
These forward-looking statements speak as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, as well as our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website, for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies of these documents may be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the investor relations section of our website. 
Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call such as EPS, net income, operating margin and operating income are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. We report our GAAP results, as well as provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP financial measures, in our earnings release. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Eric.

Well thank you very much, and thank you all for joining us in your busy day. We have once again delivered strong revenue performance, particularly on core Google.com search and strong cash flow in our seasonally weak quarter. We're obviously very pleased with that. 
Traffic was stronger than we expected on Google.com both domestically and internationally, with annual traffic growth actually increasing over time, which is a very positive surprise. We are clearly doing the right things to attract and retain users. You can see this in the success of our many products. We're very focused now on people spending their time searching, using information online and doing it in a global way. The summer seasonality that we always talk about does appear to be milder than we expected, which is also good news. 
We are improving our ability to monetize searches, as we do every quarter, with another strong quarter of ads quality improvements. We are still continuing to see strength in revenue per query and click-through rate, and the pace of ads quality innovation is strong as we continue to scale up this effort and build up on our expertise. It is a big area of investment for us and an important one. 
So we have continued to make significant investments, as we have previously discussed. We are growing rapidly, building the best infrastructure, hiring the best to extend our footprint internationally, all the things that we talked about. Building better and better products and invest in doing so in the model that we've talked about: 70/20/10, 20% of the time, and that sort of thing. 
The data center is reducing latency, increasing search indices, et cetera. Network effects are driven by scale, and Google is the beneficiary of that. By focusing on the best talent -- and we have talked about this as well -- we have a growing percentage of international hires and international offices contributing to our global product set. 
We are building now localized products for each of these markets and we are seeing significant gains in terms of our role and our impact in each of these languages and cultures in ways that matter to end users. Of course, we are still applying the kind of discipline that we have always talked about with respect to making strategic long-term investments and short-term profits. 
So we are busy executing on our search, ads and apps strategy at scale all around the world. It is a focused strategy with these three pillars that will really grow the Google ecosystem. 
From a Google perspective, when we look at the quarter, one area we exceeded over our expense plan was headcount. We are very pleased with the talent that we've brought on board, but going forward we will watch this area very closely. So when I look at the quarter, we are very pleased with what we're delivering. The product model is working, our global growth strategy is working, our innovation model is working, and we continue to be an innovator at scale, and we certainly expect that to continue. 
I do want to mention -- as I have before -- that the second quarter which we just completed and the third quarter that we are in are seasonally weaker in traffic than the first and fourth and we would, of course, expect that to be true for many, many years to come. 
Let me turn it over to George for his comments and then I will join you at the end. Go ahead, George. 
George Reyes
Thanks, Eric and good afternoon, everyone. I will go through a discussion of the quarter quickly so that we can allow more time for your questions. Gross revenue increased to $3.9 billion, representing 58% growth over last year. Despite expected seasonal weakness, we experienced particular strength in our Google.com properties, driven primarily by stronger than expected traffic growth globally, as well as continued improvements in ads quality. 
As Eric mentioned earlier, the pace of ads quality innovation was strong, with the aggregate of these improvements positively impacting Google.com revenue. Revenue from Google.com properties was $2.5 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 74% and sequential growth of 9%. 
Now I will turn AdSense revenue, which grew 36% over last year and was approximately flat at $1.35 billion. Growth in AdSense was affected by several factors, including typical seasonality that we see in our network during Q2 and to a lesser extent changes to the AdSense implementation of certain AdSense research partners that were less favorable to revenue. 
We also implemented changes that improve the user experience on our network, as well as provide more value to advertisers. For instance, AdSense for Content revenue was affected by policy changes such as termination of publishers who were not meeting our quality thresholds, partially offset by strong revenue growth from other AdSense for Content partners. 
Let's now look at aggregate paid clicks growth. To remind you, aggregate paid clicks include clicks related to ads served on Google properties, as well as ads served on our partner sites. Aggregate paid clicks grew approximately 47% over Q2 of last year and were roughly flat with Q1 levels, reflecting the typical seasonal pattern we see in Q2. 
Let me now discuss our international performance. We continue to make significant international investments, and we're seeing the benefits of this strategy. International revenue increased to 48% of total revenue, or roughly $1.8 billion, driven primarily by strong growth in Europe, despite weaker seasonal traffic trends. Spain, Italy and France in particular outperformed in Q2, while Germany, along with the UK, were significant drivers of revenue growth. 
The UK came in with revenues of $600 million and 4% sequential growth. Our substantial investments in R&D, sales and marketing, as well as infrastructure, are benefiting our smaller markets as well, with healthy growth rates in markets like Brazil, China and Korea. 
Now turning to expenses, traffic acquisition costs were $1.15 billion and 30% of total advertising revenue, down from 31% in Q1. AdSense TAC was just over $1 billion, while TAC related to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our websites totaled $87 million in the quarter. As we grow our AdSense partner network and embark upon new initiatives, we may see additional pressure on TAC rates going forward. 
Other costs of revenue increased $67 million over the prior quarter primarily as a result of increases in costs related to datacenters, included depreciation, equipment and operations. We anticipate that other costs of sales will continue to increase going forward. 
Looking at operating expenses, operating expenses in Q2 other than cost of revenue included $234 million in stock-based compensation and totaled $1.2 billion. The growth in OpEx was primarily driven by increases in expenses related to payroll and facilities, which was $625 million in the quarter. 
One of the larger drivers of payroll expense was the company bonus plan. This was due in part to a revision of our bonus accrual methodology that will allow us to more proportionately recognize the related expenses each quarter. This all led to a higher bonus accrual in Q2, which includes a catch-up from Q1, and affected all expense line items. 
A second factor driving expenses was headcount growth, which led to higher payroll expenses. We added 1,548 employees in Q2, the majority in sales and marketing and engineering. At the end of the quarter, we had a full-time employee base of 13,786. The percentage of our international hires, new hires, also continued to rise, demonstrating our commitment to further scale the business internationally. 
We have grown quickly to address strategic opportunities, and as we grow we're applying increased discipline when making investments and taking a careful look at how we allocate resources efficiently across the world. 
Turning to operating profit, non-GAAP operating profit which excludes stock-based compensation, was $1.3 billion, with non-GAAP operating margins of 35%, a decline from 38% in Q1. 
Now turning to cash flow, operating cash flow was strong at $1.2 billion and CapEx for the quarter declined to $575 million. The majority of our CapEx was again related to IT infrastructure investments, including production of servers, datacenter construction and networking equipment. We will continue to make these investments going forward as our infrastructure and resources make possible such innovations as universal search, and will further our leadership position in the industry. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, which we define as cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased to $655 million. 
So in summary, we believe our results reflect the strength of our core search and ads business, while our significant but disciplined investment positions going forward will allow us to leverage everything that we have been doing at Google. 
Now I will turn it over to Sergey. 
Sergey Brin
Thanks, George. I am really excited to tell you about what we have accomplished in the past quarter, especially with respect to search. And of course, search remains the heart of what we do. We had a big launch this past quarter in particular with universal search. This means now when you search on Google.com -- and soon it will be available on our international domains -- you are going to get results from both the web as well as image, video, news, maps and books all together. 
This may seem simple, but in fact it has taken a lot of infrastructure work just to be able to do all the computation across all those corpuses, as well as the algorithms that allow us to rank those disparate types of information together. 
Just a couple days ago, I was researching an old IBM mainframe system from the 1960s I had created on Google, and it never occurred to me to search for videos on that kind of query. But in fact, there were great videos and they popped up, and I watched both IBM's promotional videos from the '60s as well as a fantastic kind of looking back research history video about that particular computer. It turned out to be very useful to me. I expect that other users also find this useful, along with all the other corpuses I mentioned, not just video. It is just amazing where you don't think to search for something you are looking for where the information could just be fantastic. 
On the international front, we have been making great strides. We are actually now experimenting with trying new kinds of home pages, for example in Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, that are completely different types than we have tried before on our U.S. sites, as well as our European sites. We think it will be more appropriate for the local cultures and their contexts and their broadband connections, which for example in Korea are extraordinarily fast. The initial results, by the way, have been coming back quite positive, so we are optimistic about that. 
A big launch that maybe we don't appreciate so much in the U.S. is the cross-language information retrieval. What that means is that if you run your query in one language -- and by the way, don't forget many users out there, if they don't speak English, they can only get in their language about a tenth of the information that is available on the web as in English, so it is a much smaller set. But now, when they do their query, we will actually run that query in other languages, including English, and get back the results and translate them back. 
This is just really phenomenal. This is really opening the true power of the web to people who don't speak necessarily English. By the way, it works in English, too so occasionally, when you get stuff and it is only in French or Italian or whatnot, you'll get it back. I am very excited about this particular one. 
Now in addition to search, of course, we have been working on our iGoogle page, the personalized home page, as we used to call it. It is launched in 18 new domains. It is one of our fastest-growing products. We have been effecting fantastic gadgets for them, the little modules that you plug in. I have about 20 on my home page. It is really a good way to be able to see a bunch of information at once, not to have to navigate to disparate sites. 
We launched GadgetMaker, which lets people who aren't JavaScript and Ajax wizards in their own right to actually create gadgets that are going to be useful for things like sharing photos, planning events and whatnot. This is just one aspect in the way that we are personalizing the web. I think we are going to continue to invest lots of resources in this area. 
Now, jumping ahead, while there are so many things I would like to tell you about some of our web efforts, I only have limited time here. On ads, we have been doing a lot of work on ads, as always. Our goal is to connect advertisers with people who really care about their advertisements, who are really interested in their products. So the most important thing is the quality of our ad system. 
Q2 was a really strong quarter. We had lots of launches of different ad quality improvements, improvements in the algorithms. We had good results with our advertisers and with the publishers as well. We also enhanced the feedback system that allows users to give us feedback on the ads. It also better connects users with the advertisers that they would be best served by. 
Now, advertisers obviously want to get traffic to their websites, but ultimately they are interested in getting sales or leads or whatnot. So we want to make the whole process for the advertisers' marketing spend as effective as possible. Starting first off with the launch of the redesigned Google Analytics, it's got new visualization tools and custom dashboards. It really lets marketers and advertisers and people who just really care about their websites get great information and understand about how people are actually using those websites. That allows them to in turn optimize their websites. 
We added ten new languages, that is up to 17 languages supported now. We actually have had as a result, great growth in both new customers for Analytics, as well as people linking their AdWords account to their Google Analytics account, which is the most powerful combination. 
We've also added very important placement performance as well as search query information. So now, advertisers know where in our network precisely their ads are running. This obviously gives them better control over the ads too, and also which search queries are generating the best results. It is very useful information. We have obviously had a lot of demand for that and we finally have it out. 
Now lastly, I just wanted to mention our continuing work, we mentioned this before, but the pay-per-action advertising. Ultimately, as I said, the advertisers want not clicks, but they want something to happen like a purchase and whatnot. The pay-per-action advertising is now available to all advertisers and on all publisher sites. We have been having lots of advertisers move to this model. It is such a no-brainer. Then you don't have to figure out for yourself; well, I don't know how much a click is worth to me and whatnot. It really ties it directly to the action. 
Anyhow, all told, I am very excited about the progress we have been making on both search and ads, and for apps, I would love to turn it over to Larry. 
Larry Page
Well, thank you, Sergey. We continue to really invest in building simple web-based applications to help all of our users organize their information and create new content. As Sergey already mentioned with that mainframe example about video, we have been really excited about video. The best example of this is really YouTube. We made very strong progress this quarter, YouTube did, in many different areas. We added local support in nine new countries, and also, local users can now enjoy locally generated content, new features there, and new features on featured videos, directors and promotions. We have gotten great response to all of those things, which has resulted in increased usage. 
We also added many new partners on YouTube, several of them in newly added markets like Hearst Argyle Television, National Geographic and Global de Brazil. We also broadened our distribution through other partnerships, for example, Motorola, Telecom Italia and Apple on the iPhone and Apple TV. The iPhone, of course, has an amazing user experience in looking at YouTube. You can waste very many hours, and also enjoy useful content like mainframe videos on your iPhone. 
So Google Apps also had a very successful quarter overall. We were named number one product of the year by PC World magazine, which we were very excited about. We launched our apps premiere partner edition for ISPs to offer co-branded apps to their subscribers. And we signed a new deal with several new partners, including Virgin Media, a UK ISP. 
We also launched a tool in apps to enable easy migration of large numbers of email accounts to Gmail. This does things like preserves the header information, threads all the conversations, makes your email searchable. For example, just one customer migrated 30,000 users with 3 million emails in just 24 hours. So we have a lot of excitement around that. 
We also announced our intent to acquire Postini for $625 million. What that lets large enterprises do is really give them with some of the complex issues that they have like their business rules, their security mandates and legal compliance, and really let them do that easily over an email solution. So we are really excited about that, and it lets us add web-hosted security and corporate compliance for email, IM and other communications. Postini was actually one of our first partners in Google Apps. Again, we are really excited about this and I think that many of our customers are as well. 
Let me switch gears for a second and talk a little bit about developers. Really to support our efforts across all of the areas of the company -- search, advertising and applications -- we're really supporting a growing community of developers. As part of that effort, we had our first worldwide Developer Day to reach out to that community. We had over 5,000 developers participate in over ten countries and online, and we got a great response from them. 
We also at that time delivered several new tools and APIs for the developers to work with. One was called Google Gears, which is an open source project that enables web-based applications to run offline. We also launched Maplets, which lets people extend Google Maps, and there's examples like real estate search and embedded photographs that developers are implementing now. 
So all of these developers are really helping us to create new and interesting information and applications and content which helps us build our whole ecosystem and makes the user experience better for everybody. 
I was really excited by our progress in this quarter, and now I will turn it over to Eric. 
Eric Schmidt
Thank you. As I reflect on the quarter, I am really struck by our ability to operate and move forward at this scale. Normally, innovation at our size and growth begins to slow but here, it seems to be accelerating. We are producing more products with many more users, more languages, in more countries in the ways that we have talked about. I think it is because our model is working so well that we are so optimistic about the future. 
When we talk about products, and Sergey talked, for example, about iGoogle, you can see something which goes from almost no users when it is introduced to many, many, many millions of users very, very quickly. So we know this model will continue to scale, and we know that we are focused on our primary mission, which is around search, ads and apps. That focus is going to continue, with many good things to come in the future. 
So with that, maybe we should get some questions and comments. Maria? 
Maria Shim
Operator, could we start taking questions, please? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs. 
 Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Eric, one question for you. I think you have said previously that it was your goal to grow operating income each quarter on a sequential basis. This quarter, obviously, it was down. 
I was wondering if that was completely due to the bonus accrual that you had mentioned, given the number of employees you hired was lower than we thought, D&A was lower than we thought and revenue was higher, because I am trying to get to that underlying difference. If you could explain in a little bit more detail how much that incremental bonus accrual was. Thanks. 
Eric Schmidt
In general, we don't break out all the puts and takes on the changes in the accrual. What I would tell you is that we overspent against our own plan in the area of headcount, and some of it was related to this bonus accrual that I talked about; and some, because we hired a little faster than we had planned. 
In looking at it we thought, was this a mistake or not? We decided it was not a mistake, that in fact the kind of people we brought in are so good that we're happy we did this. As I said earlier, we will continue to watch this very carefully in the future. 
 Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Thank you. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Imran Khan – JP Morgan. 
Imran Khan – JP Morgan
Hi, thank you for taking my question. One clarification question and then a follow-up. For clarification, when you said that you will closely look at headcount, should we assume that headcount growth will slow down? 
Secondly, Eric, you talked about how your traffic growth rate is actually accelerating. If we look at the paid click volume it is flat sequentially, considering traffic growth rate is accelerating and you're getting into new countries. Why is paid click volume flat sequentially? Thank you. 
Eric Schmidt
With respect to the headcount, as I said, we ended up somewhat higher on our headcount expenses than we planned, which is the issue that Anthony asked about as well. We will watch it, we will adjust, we will be opportunistic but we are going to be careful about that. Jonathan, do you want to talk about paid clicks? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Typically, this is a slow quarter for paid click growth. It is basically the lowest in the year from a seasonality perspective. If you look at it on a year-over-year growth rate, paid clicks is very healthy and consistent with the trends that we have been seeing. Really, I would characterize the quarter as one of very strong traffic growth domestically and internationally in what typically we see as a somewhat weaker quarter from a traffic perspective. 
Sergey Brin
Actually, if I can add one more thing on the paid clicks. As we develop improved algorithms for showing our ads and as a result we're able to achieve better click-throughs, better monetization and whatnot, we usually like to split the benefit of that between both able to generate more revenue for other publishers than ourselves; but also, we like to improve the user experience, which in some cases means we try to show fewer ads in certain locations where we think they are less likely to get clicked on. That has a significant effect. 
Imran Khan – JP Morgan
Thank you. That's very helpful. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup. 
 Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
I wanted to follow up with Sergey on that last point. If you are making the ads more targeted and qualified -- which is what we think is happening -- at the end, advertisers should see more qualified leads and be willing to pay for that. We have seen an acceleration in your CPC growth the last two quarters and I know there's a lot of things that feed into that. 
But do you think that that actually is what's happening, or do you think that that kind of growth driver; that is, that CPC inflection point, growing because of increased advertiser interest and being willing to pay for more qualified leads? Do you think that is still to come? 
Sergey Brin
I think it is a combination of factors. On the CPC, for example, the international mix changes, the nature of queries from season to season changes, and whatnot. On the whole, as you said, I do think that advertisers are seeing really good returns, and therefore they do bid higher. 
The other effect, as I mentioned, is that we tend to, when we have the opportunity, we feel like maybe we would be better off displacing some of the ads to show more search results higher on the page or taking more of the page especially as we improve the ad systems; therefore, we're still making equal or greater revenue. We do take that opportunity to increase the barriers to getting some ads up there. So that also has significant effects. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
In general, we have talked about this in the past, but we definitely believe there is plenty of room to grow pricing. We know that advertisers watch their ROI very carefully and they monitor their budgets accordingly. Sergey alluded to the general dynamic of improving the quality of ads and what you can expect the dynamic there is with respect to click-through rates rising while the number of ads declines. 
Basically what we are seeing is when you try to parse out the average CPC, the growth rates in emerging markets versus developed markets impacts this a lot, because the new markets have lower prices and the faster growth in new markets tends to put downward pressure on CPC. 
The other big thing that you saw this quarter was, as Eric mentioned, traffic growth on Google.com. When Google.com grows faster, that positively impacts CPC significantly. We did, as Eric mentioned, see very strong traffic growth there. So a lot of it is the distribution piece. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley. 
 Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley
Thanks. I just want a couple clarifications. Eric, you've talked about the heads and basically the headcount and the operating expense changes and said you are going to watch it and you feel great about the people you've hired. 
But if could indicate if a portion of those were sales heads and a portion were international heads. I guess our translation would be that you feel comfortable that there will be related revenue commensurate to the hires in the next two to three quarters. 
If we could drill down on the bonus accrual a little bit, should we expect to see it play out on a more normalized basis on a go-forward basis? Is it fair to say that half of the difference between what you might have been expecting in OpEx and half of what you got for the quarter was related to the accrual? 
A third question if we may, just for a little clarification, any thoughts on how we should think about cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue on a go-forward basis? 
If you could answer any of those three, we will be happy because we know we went over our quota. Thank you. 
 Eric Schmidt
 Thank you, Mary. I will let George answer the second two. With respect to productivity of our headcount, our headcount, especially in sales, is productive very, very quickly. Omid talks and says that it's maybe even with the same quarter which they are hired is a model that is scaleable. 
Omid Kordestani
Again, the sales force name at Google means different things. It is the field forces which are calling on new Fortune companies, for example, as well as operational people that manage our online advertisers and the optimizations that go into the improvements. All of our analysis actually shows excellent productivity across the board. Some of the emerging markets obviously have different rates of productivity, and it is an investment we're making for the future there. 
But all in all, we've actually been going through a very thorough process of figuring out how best to take the sales force and reorganize them to represent all the various products we have today, from the core search products to the brand name products and monitor our productivity really carefully as we add resources both domestically and internationally. 
George Reyes
Mary, going forward it should be a more normalized bonus accrual process. This was just sort of a one-time inflection that we tried to do to true-up the bonus. 
Operator
 Your next question comes from Ben Schachter - UBS. 
 Ben Schachter - UBS
There's a lot of litigation and regulatory issues around both the company and the industry, some established and some potential. What are the top two or three that you think potentially pose both the greatest risks for the company and the greatest opportunity? 
Separately, at a very high level the success of text-based search ads have really shown how valuable advertisers find highly-targeted ads. What do you think are the key barriers and opportunities to better targeting on the display and video side, both online and off? Thanks. 
 Eric Schmidt
Ben, on your first question about litigation, we have already disclosed two major areas of litigation for Google; the first being in the book area, the book scanning and Library Project, and the second involving Viacom. Both of those are very important from the standpoint of principle. It would be great if those would go away or somehow would be resolved by technology or so forth. But we take those very seriously because we were sued by people who were unhappy with what we believed we were doing was right. 
With respect to broader litigation issues, Google is in the information business. There's always a potential that governments will decide that some of the things that we're doing are appropriate or inappropriate in ways that make our business harder. However, there are no short-term threats in that regard, and in fact in many cases the opening up of markets, the opening up of the Internet -- especially in countries outside the United States -- is really putting pressure on governments to have a broader information access approach, make information more broadly available, open up their Internet borders in a good way. So we are very optimistic about that sort of thing. 
On your second question, we will have Omid answer that. 
Omid Kordestani
There's two fronts really, two thrusts of work going on in the core business and there is continual work on ads improvement. There are all kinds of algorithms that continue to improve the targetability of the ads and the efficiency and accountability for advertisers and marketers. 
The interplay that was interesting between display and brand advertising and our core business, where we're seeing great success. This last quarter, we saw Pepsi in the U.S.; we saw Coke in France and Heinz in the U.S. really try to take advantage of both sides of the equation here. So advertisers are looking for ways to interact with our users online and have a two-way conversation about their brands really are starting to use YouTube very effectively and advertise on the content network, which allows them this targeted reach. 
It's also possible to have this two-way conversation, really an engagement with the users that the advertisers are really interested in. So we see great submissions of video or contests that then create that brand affinity, as well as then the ability to reach the audience and targetability that search provides. 
So we are really experimenting with all of that, and the core innovation is driving the core targetability and we're trying to learn a lot on how to best leverage the network as well as the properties like YouTube to have a comprehensive solution for the advertisers. 
Operator
 Your next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns. 
 Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
 I was wondering if you could give us a little more color or clarity on the current impact of your other endeavors, monetization on YouTube, the radio side, TV and print. When do you think it may start to become more material? 
You've recently rolled out site authentication as well as the unavailable after tag. I guess our thoughts there are, when should we see any sort of impact on either search volumes or click-through rates or CPCs going forward? Thanks. 
Omid Kordestani
 On all the new initiative from TV to print, again we have moved from the beta phase where we tested a few advertisers and a few publishers and really expand beyond that. We're seeing really excellent adoption. What we're seeing is the advertisers are really pleased, and the partners are really pleased with the type of monetization they are experiencing. 
Again, it is going to be too early for us to really see a material impact, given the scale of the other sides of the business. The mantra I'm following right now is that we really need to first prove this model for both the advertisers and the publishers before we really scale it and scale it both in specific geographies as well as internationally. I think hopefully in the next few quarters we can shed more light on this. But at this point, we are seeing, as I said, great success with the early results and we hope to be able to scaled these models. 
Operator
 Your next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch. 
 Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Thanks for taking the question. When I look at the advertising revenues up 73% on Google websites, was there anything non-search-related really driving that number? Long term, could you discuss your outlook for display or video advertising for Google? Do you think it can be a meaningful percentage of your total revenues? 
 Eric Schmidt
 It certainly will eventually be a significant and meaningful percentage. Jonathan or Omid, do you want to talk a little bit about that? 
Omid Kordestani
I think I just spoke to that earlier, is that on all these fronts we're seeing great success both in the advertiser front and the publisher front in the context of the beta test that we're doing. We have reorganized the sales force, for example, in the U.S., which is the most advanced, most mature market for us so that they can represent all the products. So every sales force and sales group now within the U.S. structure is going through a lot of training and has just been reorganized so that they don't just represent search, but they represent all the products. They have supporting expertise for the specific areas from YouTube to television to print advertising. 
What you will see from us is, again, a lot of effort to take this beyond the beta phase and engage more advertisers, more publishers. Once we prove that model, extend that internationally as quickly as possible. 
Again, I'm putting a lot of emphasis on this, there is great hiring behind it and great innovation so that we can have it be a significant portion of our revenues. We just have to see it develop. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
 Was there an impact in the quarter at all? 
Omid Kordestani
 Not this quarter. 
 Jonathan Rosenberg 
 Just in terms of the basic underlying numbers, the story really is, as we talked about, is clearly a combination of strong traffic growth and ads quality. Eric mentioned the traffic growth increasing over time and the increase in the rate there, which is very substantial. Larry and Sergey also talked about the big investment that we have been making in the user experience and search quality and the universal search launch. What I think we are really seeing there is that users are engaging in more searches by virtue of our improving the search experience. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch

 Your next question comes from Brian Pitz - Banc of America Securities. 
 Brian Pitz - Banc of America Securities
Thank you. A two-part question on eBay. Any color on the impact you've seen in the quarter on volume and cost per click from the pullback in advertising on your site? 
Any commentary on the acceleration of revenue that eBay noted yesterday on its call that is associated with your international partnership? Thank you. 
 Eric Schmidt
 eBay has been a long-term partner for Google. While it is true that they adjusted their mix in our advertising model, they continue to be a very significant advertiser. We did not see an impact on Google for many of the changes that they talked about that they made. 
Part of that is because Google is capable of choosing very much the best ad. When ads priority shift and people move advertising around, we can still take advantage of the highest-quality ad as produced in the auction. So far, the answer is no, no impact whatsoever. 
Our international business is very, very strong as you heard, and as a percentage of gross revenue it is growing especially strong in Europe; again, also noted in the eBay report. But that is not primarily because of our eBay-Google partnership, it is just because our international business is just strong overall. 
 Brian Pitz - Banc of America Securities

Your next question comes from Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners. 
 Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
First if you could highlight what the theoretical limit for TAC rates would be, you are close to 85%. Second, a broader question. I'm just very curious about what you're doing with regard to the spectrum. I was wondering if you could articulate what your telecom strategy is or what you are willing to articulate to this point, especially in light of some of the Google phone rumors out there. Thanks. 
 Eric Schmidt
 Let me do the second part, and I'll have George talk a little about TAC rates. First, we don't comment on rumors, and there's lots and lots of rumors which is always very exciting. We have looked pretty carefully at wireless, and we are thinking about what we want to do there. 
From a Google perspective, the most important thing is that there be an open network. We define that in the sense that people can go to a store or however they are going to get it and get a device, plug that device into a wireless network and be able to use the full capability of the Internet. In the course of using that full capability of the Internet, which is going to be delivered on these mini-devices that have come out in this space globally, they're also going to become very significant Google advertising users. 
So there's really a direct connection between the open interoperable network that we are now arguing for in SEC filings and so forth and the ultimate usage of Google services and applications, and of course, advertiser satisfaction. 
 George Reyes
On the TAC rate, on an absolute basis TAC increased. It was basically just a fundamental of more AdSense partnerships. Going forward, the future trend will depend basically on the relative growth of large AdSense partnerships and Google.com. 
 Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
 Is there a theoretical, I mean will you strike a deal? I mean, obviously you do minimum guarantees, but will you regularly start striking deals at 95%? 
 Eric Schmidt
We prefer to do profitable deals. We are happy to give the majority of the revenue to the partners, which is what this is doing. There is no particular rule that we follow. We have as a business taken the position that we do want to have growing operating income to the bottom line. Basically growing operating income on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Although we did not achieve that this past quarter, it is certainly our goal. So all of the business decisions that we do are in the context of growing operating income on a quarter-over-quarter basis on an absolute basis, as well as building a strong cash flow-based business.

 Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers. 
 Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Can you provide an update on your efforts around digital fingerprinting and content identification? Just one last question to try to wrap up the bonus accrual thing. Can you just clarify how you were accounting for your bonus accruals in 2006 and how that is changing, if it is, in 2007 in terms of the calendar basis? Thank you. 
 Eric Schmidt
 This is really a question about Claim Your Content. Larry and Sergey? 
Sergey Brin
I should probably have Chad do an update of that. But as far as I know, we have experiments that are running and actually working quite well. So we are optimistic to be able to deploy that live in the near future. I haven't heard of any significant impediments. 
Obviously, this will present a new capability to content owners which they haven't had in the past with any other sites or mediums to be able to just detect in such a scaleable way easily, just in an automated way. So we are very excited about it. 
 George Reyes
A portion of the increase in the OpEx is a function of the change in the bonus accrual. That methodology includes a piece that relates to the catch-up of related Q1 charges. So that would be one angle on it. We also expect our bonus expenses to be more normalized or proportional going forward and less of a ramp-up throughout the year. 
Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers 
 So is it reasonable to think that, for example, in the fourth quarter this year that you will have less bonus accrual on a relative basis will be in the fourth quarter this year than it was last year? 
 George Reyes
It will be normalized throughout the year going forward. 
Operator
 Your next question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse. 
 Heath Terry - Credit Suisse
Thank you. I'm just wondering if you could just give us an update on Google Local, what you see as being the barriers in terms of really filling out the business directory there, as well as starting to bring monetization of the impressive level of traffic that you have gotten for that site up to where monetization in your core search product is? 
 Larry Page
I think we have been really excited about our efforts on local and business listings and apps, which are all interrelated. From a user experience, I think there's still a long ways to go to make those things work even better. We have done experiments with things like having businesses listed on maps so you can see where they are and things like that. I see all those things as interrelated. Also improved targetability of advertising for local advertisers or locally targeted businesses. 
I think we are in the quite early stages of those products. The user experiences are improving rapidly, and I think they will continue to. Also, the advertising capabilities of advertisers to target particular local needs is also improving really rapidly. I think we are really excited about that. It is sort of like the other areas people have been asking about, I think there is a lot of initial progress which we are very excited about, and we expect to have a lot more going forward. 
 Jonathan Rosenberg
On some specific efforts this quarter, I think one of the things we did particularly with respect to Local Business Center was focus on making it easier and faster for businesses to submit their information. We launched a business ownership verification via phone and SMS in a bunch of international locales. I think we're up to about eight countries which replaces some of the more cumbersome processes that we had for verification efforts which previously could take days or longer. We have got that down to a few minutes. 
Some of the other thing that we did were better capabilities just in terms of bulk uploading of lists of business locations that cater to large chains of businesses. We've got a much, much more robust UI for doing that. So as we build out all of that underlying functionality, we are going to be able to do a whole lot more here with Local.

Your next question comes from Youssef Squali - Jefferies. 
Youssef Squali - Jefferies
Thank you very much. George, I want to go back to the comments you made about a more normalized bonus accrual level starting in Q3. Any reason to believe then that margins could decline further from their Q2 levels? Doesn't sound like it, but I was wondering if you can comment. 
Larry, on your foray into the enterprise market, you started with search appliances in '02. Now you are going after hosted applications. Can you speak to the logic of going after that market, which looks very different to us from your core search market? Looking at the margin characteristics of other companies, it looks like it may be very dilutive to your overall margins. 
 Eric Schmidt
 Larry, do you want to do the second part? 
 Larry Page
I think one thing to keep in mind, we have Gmail, for example, has been a very successful product. We're really excited about it. There's many people within companies who need different kinds of functionality in order to use Gmail, and they are among the heaviest users. We don't really think about it in that way, I guess. I think that we have a tremendous amount of usage with Gmail and other hosted apps within Enterprises, and we are going to do just fine making money. 
I think the other kind of businesses you've seen there have a very different structure than what we have. I am not concerned about that applying to us, those businesses necessarily being very low margin. 
 George Reyes
 On your other question we're just not going to comment on forward-looking margins. We just don't do that. 
Operator
 Your final question comes from Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray. 
 Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
Good afternoon. It looks like you guys have been a little bit more aggressive in China, specifically inking a deal with Sina. It sounds like you've strengthened your brand there. Any thoughts on how your efforts in China are going specifically? 
 Eric Schmidt
When we entered China, we entered under a set of restrictions that have been well publicized. We decided to invest heavily in China. We now have quite a talented engineering team, strong marketing, strong sales; very, very good connectivity and very low latency. 
The combination of that and a set of very good Chinese language products for search, advertising and some new ones they just launched seem to be accelerating our market share. 
Although it does not appear that we are number one in the market, it looks like we are now in a situation where we are quite competitive. In many areas, users tell us that our products are better. So it is a very good start. Although we don't think that this will result in an immediate, huge success, we think that the tenacity of Google, the many strengths that Google brings to the party will bring significant victories in China over the next few years. 
With that, what I would like to do is let's finish up. Thank you all again for spending so much time with us. When I think about what we have done and the set of networks that we have created: the network of users, the network of advertisers, the network of publishers. Google is doing a particularly good job of using these networks and tying them together in clever and new and innovative ways to provide real value to users, of course, especially in advertising, but also real value in terms of economics. 
It is the sum of that that I think is perhaps the least understood part of Google. It is the fact that we can link publishers and advertisers and users in new solutions that really do solve their problems. They solve their problems in ways that they have never been solved before, and we do it on a global scale. 
So with that, thank you very, very much.

Good day and welcome to the Google Inc. conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Kim Jabal, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Kim Jabal
Hello, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2007 earnings call. On the call with us today are Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer; George Reyes, Chief Financial Officer; Larry Page, Founder and President of Products; Sergey Brin, Founder and President of Technology; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President of Product Management; and Omid Kordestani, Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Operations. Eric, George, Larry and Sergey will provide some thoughts on the quarter, and then we will have Jonathan and Omid join us for your questions. 
This call is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. Our press release issued a few minutes ago is now posted on our website, as well as presentation slides that will accompany today's prepared remarks. A replay of this call will be available within a few hours. 
Some of the comments we will make today are forward looking, including statements regarding international growth; possible future benefits from our partner deals; growth in our headcount; future investments in partnerships, distribution and content; future product innovation; our expected operating expenses; our expected level of capital expenditures; our expected margins; charges associated with stock-based compensation and possible future pressure on traffic acquisition cost rates. 
These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These forward-looking statements speak as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, as well as our earnings release posted on our website for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Copies of these documents may be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call such as EPS, net income, operating margin, operating income and our effective tax rate are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2006, we removed certain discrete tax items from non-GAAP net income and EPS. Finally, we adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, a measure we refer to as free cash flow. We report our GAAP results, as well as provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP financial measures in our earnings release. You can obtain a copy of our earnings release by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. 
Now with that, I will turn the call over to Eric.

Well, thank you very much, Kim. As everybody can see from the press release, we are ecstatic about our financial results this past quarter. Before I start talking about how well we did this quarter, I would like to remind everybody as I have each year at this time, that we are about to enter our seasonally slower summer growth period, and make sure you factor that in when thinking about how our business will grow. 
Our core business at Google remains very strong and continues to grow. We have seen excellent performance in the U.S.; performance internationally is even better. International growth across many markets confirms the validity of our business model: build the market, monetization will follow. What is different now is that everyone is thinking more creatively about monetization opportunities, simply because they have learned about our successes and failures in past rollouts. So we're getting a benefit from that. 
We are continuing to make significant investments in our core business. Data centers, of course, primarily for speed, comprehensiveness and usefulness and engineering to preserve our 70/20/10 model that you have heard many times before. In sales and support -- and I should say this globally by the way -- to attract and retain users and advertisers. And in partnerships of course. Our AdSense partners, content partners, distribution partners, offline partners. 
Sometimes I worry that we spend so much time talking about all the new things that we don't focus as much on the core business, especially in our marketing and messaging. In looking at the quarter, the most important message is that our core business is very strong. It is the core business that is driving our success. Core services are as vital and vibrant and innovative as they could possibly be. 
The success of our core business continues to let us take calculated risks in new markets and expand in new products. Geographic, for example, committing to our European expansion, committed to Asia. China, of course, is very important to us, but only one market of many that are now receiving great focus at Google. 
Expanding our business to multiple platforms and formats. In display advertising, DoubleClick, which of course was the subject of our call last week which all of you participated in. In video, YouTube, hugely successful for us; video syndication now working well for us. The BBC deal, a historic deal for us this quarter. In mobile, LG and Samsung deals this quarter driving mobile adoption for the Internet and for Google in many, many good ways; many partnerships already in place. In the enterprise business, a premier version this quarter including now Docs & Spreadsheets. 
We are also expanding our business to offline media, again the subject of a lot of discussion. Radio, the Clear Channel deal that we announced on Monday, again drives the definitive deal to make that business hugely successful for us. In TV, the EchoStar deal similarly announced very recently, which allows us to do targeted advertising in the television world. In print, the test that we announced a couple months ago is doing extremely well and being expanded as we learn what really works and what does not. 
Each of these strategies involves creating solutions that benefit both advertisers and users, and it is the synergy between them that we have been able to harness. Targeted, useful, effective advertising will continue to be our mantra; you all know that, of course. Technology and efficiency is the core of our technology approach, and it really does benefit end users. 
In fact, if you think about it, user benefit is the most important thing that we focus on as to how we make these decisions. Our past experiences and our failures, if you will, the learnings that we get show us what works and what does not. From our perspective, and I think the forward challenge for the company, is simply making these learnings scale globally so very, very quickly. This is why we are so excited not just about the quarter, but for the quarters that lie ahead. 
Now rather than me talking, maybe George, you could take everybody through the financials and a lot of the details, which are very impressive. 
George Reyes
So let's go ahead and get started. Thank you very much, Eric, for that introduction. As you can tell, Q1 was a very strong quarter for us with truly impressive growth driven by our continued leadership in both search and advertising. Gross revenue increased 63% over Q1 of last year to $3.7 billion. Revenue from Google properties was $2.3 billion, representing strong year-over-year growth of 76%. We experienced healthy traffic growth in our Google.com business both domestically and internationally. Monetization continues to be strong, positively impacted by improvements in our ads in Q1, as well as in prior quarters. 
As we have discussed in previous quarters, we are constantly innovating to show our users more relevant and targeted ads, which in turn leads to benefits for our advertisers and strengthens our business. The investments in our extensive network of partnerships were also contributing meaningfully to our growth. AdSense revenues increased 45% over last year to $1.3 billion, driven by strong growth across our existing partners, as well as launching a few new partners. 
As on Google.com, our AdSense business experienced very strong traffic gains in the quarter, particularly internationally. I will go into more detail about our international performance in a moment. Beginning last quarter we began to disclose the growth in paid clicks. This number includes clicks related to ads served on Google properties, as well ads served on our partner sites. Aggregate paid clicks grew approximately 52% over Q1 of last year and approximately 13% over Q4. 
Now I will turn to the geographic discussion. We are continuing to see significant momentum in our international business as we invest in the infrastructure to address our global opportunity. International revenue was 47% of total revenue, or $1.7 billion. As is typical in the first quarter, the UK was particularly strong with revenues of $578 million and 23% sequential growth as the travel and finance verticals rebounded as we expected from Q4. Other markets that contributed meaningfully to growth were Germany, France and Spain, as well as some of our Asian markets like Japan and also Australia. 
In addition, it is important to note that some of our smaller markets are also performing very well, including Ireland, Brazil and Korea, which benefited from our partnership with Daum. This demonstrates the diversity of our business and the potential to grow our business even more significantly outside the United States. 
Turning to TAC, traffic acquisition costs were $1.1 billion. The majority of TAC is related to the amounts paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled just over $1 billion. The increase is due primarily to growth of more significant AdSense partnerships. As we grow our distribution in AdSense partner network and embark upon new initiatives, we may see additional pressure on TAC rates going forward. TAC related to distribution partners totaled $73 million in Q1. The increase in these traffic acquisition costs is associated with some of our largest distribution deals ramping up. 
Other costs of revenue increased $38 million over the prior quarter, primarily as a result of increases in depreciation related to data centers, bandwidth costs and content acquisition costs. Going forward, we anticipate that other cost of sales will increase as each of these line items grow. 
Turning to operating expenses, OpEx included $184 million in stock-based compensation and totaled $972 million. These included $506 million in payroll-related and facilities expenses, an increase of $13 million over the prior quarter. R&D decreased as a percentage of revenue, primarily due to lower expenses related to company bonuses in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, while sales and marketing and G&A were relatively flat as a percentage of revenue. 
Non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock-based compensation, rose to $1.4 billion with non-GAAP operating margins of 38%, up from 37% in Q4. As we have said in the past, margins may decline as we continue to invest heavily in our business. You should expect continued growth in headcount, across functions and across the world. We also expect continued investments in AdSense partnerships, distribution partners and content. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $597 million. While there were some real estate-related expenditures as in prior quarters, the majority of our CapEx was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers and networking equipment. As we have discussed previously, we expect to make continued significant capital expenditure investments to drive the growth of our business as these investments have contributed tremendously to our success to date. 
Now turning to cash flow, operating cash flow was strong at just over $1.2 billion. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure which we define as cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased to $623 million. 
With that, I will turn it over to Larry. 
Larry Page
Thanks, George. I'm not only excited about our financial performance, but also our product performance in the quarter, and that's what I am going to tell you a little bit about. Now remember, we keep about 70% of our resources focused on our core business which is search and ads, and the rest of that, which is probably the other 30%, is probably primarily what you hear about. But we work tremendously hard to improve our core relevance and our focus on search, and we made many improvements this quarter in many, many different markets on just basic quality and relevance in our search. 
We've also made user experience improvements which are easier to see, and those are on things like when you do a search, you can actually get maps and reviews of businesses right in your search results and also in very, very many countries. We released a bunch of new ones this quarter. 
We are also looking a lot more at content. So things like personalized search where the results are tailored to you specifically are things we also made great strides in. Now we have also, I think, made great strides in moving people towards web computing, and things like Gmail we opened up sign-ups this quarter and had very healthy growth there, which for us we are really excited about. We also improved our Docs & Spreadsheets product, releasing 15 new languages, and we also had tremendous growth there. 
We also released Google Apps Premier, which is a product for companies and universities we launched this quarter. It lets you have Gmail for your own domain, and you can even use your own existing login process for your users to log in to Gmail and use Docs & Spreadsheets and all of our great products. We have a lot of great customers there, Northwestern; even customers in Kenya and Rwanda, and we have pilots with GE and P&G, and we're very excited also about the prospects there. 
In YouTube, we have had tremendous uptake of YouTube, and I would say the growth is accelerating even more. We have made many improvements to those sites, which increased usage of community features of people talking about videos, rating them and so on, and just generally improving the experience there and going gangbusters there. 
In the personalized home page on Google, we released a new, improved version of that with things like themes so you can have your personalized home page on the beach or at the bus station and see a little bit of the weather that is going on, and we had tremendous uptake with huge numbers of our users adopting that on the first day. 
We also released things like the Google Talk, which lets you see your friends on your Google personalized home page, and we look forward to improving those products even more. 
Our user experience is still a tremendous focus for us, and new products also. With that, I would like to turn it over to Sergey and have him talk a little bit about the other part of our ecosystem, which is partners and advertisers. 
Sergey Brin
Thanks, Larry. I'm very excited to talk to you today and to echo a lot of the sentiments that Eric already shared with you: how key partnerships are to Google and how much we care about making our partners successful. 
First off, we noted some of the improvements we made to YouTube, and we also have a number of more partners there. In the past quarter we announced the BBC, the NBA, the Sundance Channel. We even have a partnership with a number of the presidential candidates this year, their video clips which we call You Choose '08. YouTube continues to grow both user-wise, as Larry mentioned, and in terms of partners. In the mobile space, we had a number of new partners sign up and a number of announcements, including Nokia and Vodafone, both two very large announcements. 
I want to spend most of the time, however, talking about advertising, both what we have done to help out our most numerous partners, our advertisers, as well as the other kinds of partnerships we have struck within the advertising space. 
First of all, we have launched Pay-Per-Action in beta, and that is the easiest way for an advertiser, in many cases, to decide how much they should pay for advertising, which is just to specify an action like a purchase and say, this is how much I am willing to pay for each purchase. We're very excited about that. Clearly it definitely speaks to what advertisers want to get most. 
We also have helped them out in getting more of those actions, conversions, purchases and what not with the introduction of the Website Optimizer. This lets you automatically test and refine your website to optimize adoption or conversion or whatever that may be. 
Another thing that will really help that is to make it easier for customers to actually transact. To spend money without fear of their credit card being stolen, without just a lot of hassle of entering the same information over and over, and we have done that with Google Checkout. In this past quarter, we announced a number of new partners for Google Checkout. We launched CompUSA and Blue Nile, and we also signed RadioShack, as well as B&H. 
Now we have been talking here mostly about search and certainly online advertising. Within online, we have expanded quite a bit. You are familiar with our AdSense for Content network. We have signed Daum up for that. That is the very large Korean site. In fact, now we have 75% of the top 20 social networks also in our AdSense network. 
The big news you have no doubt heard by now is our intent to acquire DoubleClick, and we're very excited about that because of the possibility to make it even easier for our advertisers to launch and manage their search and display campaigns, which they can now do -- or will be able to do -- in an integrated fashion. That is the Internet portion of our advertising. 
Of course, we also have been trying to make it easier for advertisers to advertise on other media, offline media. In television, for example, we have a partnership with EchoStar over at that DISH Network and that way we can deliver advertisements to DISH Network viewers. In radio more recently, we have signed a partnership with Clear Channel, which opens up a lot of great inventory to our advertisers who want to use the radio medium. 
Ultimately, as Eric said, it really comes down to end users or viewers to be consumers of this advertising. Some people feel that advertising is a zero sum game, and they shrug when they hear about all these new advertising products and the progress and what not; but that has not been our experience. In fact, fundamentally our vision is that we can make advertising better across the board, better for everyone. We don't have to have intrusive advertising to be effective. In fact, quite on the contrary, it is the interesting, relevant, sometimes entertaining advertising that is most effective for both advertisers and makes it the best possible world for the users and viewers alike. 
So, on that note, I would like to turn it back over to Eric. 
Eric Schmidt
Well, thank you very much, Sergey. As I listen to this, I am very impressed that the global growth strategy of Google continues to work very, very well. Our innovation model is clearly working; lots and lots of new products coming out and no end in sight. The partnerships that we reviewed, in particular the ones that Sergey and Larry just highlighted, are now really working, they are really running globally. The core business in search and ads, we're still at the beginning of that business. A lot of people have said that well maybe this is not such a big business. It is a huge business, and we have a lot of room to grow there. 
The complementary strategies, things like offline ads, some of the new ad initiatives, YouTube again complements our core search and ads business. There are other examples, obviously our enterprise business. They are working, too. I'm personally impressed with the way in which the management team and employees of the company have managed the growth from an operations perspective. You can imagine the dials and everything else that has to be tuned here, and yet we have been able to take advantage of the opportunity before us, and I believe we will be able to do that for the foreseeable future. 
So with that, why don't we go directly to your questions? We are going to add Jonathan and Omid as previously announced, because they do such a good job with Q&A. Operator, are you ready for the first question? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup. 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Great, thanks. Two quick questions, please. A housekeeping question: it looks like the change of the lowered tax yield on stock-based comp maybe added $0.03 to $0.05 to the number. Could you just walk through that math a little bit? 
Secondly, a broader question just on display advertising. Larry and Sergey, when you started search, you clearly had something different in mind, something more targeted than the normal advertising that was out there. What generally changed in your thinking that made you think either that the display advertising market was big enough or that you had a targetable solution that was good enough to make you want to make the moves you made, like buy DoubleClick? 
Eric Schmidt
Let's have Larry and Sergey answer the second question while they are figuring out the answer to the first. 
Sergey Brin
There were a number of things that made us excited about this area. First of all, of course, the success of our own products within the broader advertising space, not just search but for example, AdSense for Content and more recently even including image ads and things like site targeting. I think we realized how much inefficiency there really was in online advertising. Because at the face of it, you would think well, how complicated can it be? You just pick a good site for your ads and you just run them, what could be inefficient about that? 
But, in fact, it turns out there are many different websites. There are many different users who use those websites in their different situations. Advertisers, in many cases, don't have all the metrics information they need to decide which ads to run where. So we have seen good success with that, and we think we can expand that more to broader kinds of media, not just static images and what not. Of course, with this intent to acquire DoubleClick, we think we can make more advertisers much more efficient. 
Eric Schmidt
Larry and Omid and Jonathan, do you want to add a little bit more to that? 
Omid Kordestani
The other thing I would add is that we are, as we have said in the previous quarters, very busy actually with all these initiatives, including display advertising. In the last couple of quarters, we've had a lot of customer success stories where they are taking advantage of the content network, the different formats we already support, the targetability. Customers include companies like REI that, for example, use Google's display network to promote new store openings. They utilize geographic and site targeting functionality to reach both mass media sites like NewYorkTimes.com, as well as niche audiences like specialty sites like rockclimbing.com. This has proven so effective for them in driving in-store traffic that they are really going to utilize it as part of their ongoing marketing initiatives. 
So based on what we saw here, we just know that the same principle we applied to search targeting can really extend to these new initiatives and that we are going to place a lot of emphasis on that. 
Larry Page
I was just going to add that we are still in the very early stages of display ads and branding ads and that whole area. Much of the technology we have already developed for our search ads and AdSense for content and so on can be used for those markets. People do very sophisticated things around time of day and types of users with these things, and also the sites already with our AdSense network, the sites where you just choose to run your ad or not and so on, the content of those pages, all of those things apply to the kind of spaces we are now going after. 
Eric Schmidt
Could you ask the first part of your question again, the housekeeping question? 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Yes, just on the tax, it sounds like there may have been a little bit of a change in the tax rate you are applying to determine the shield on the stock-based compensation; or maybe there wasn’t a change, but it looks like there was. It looked like it was a very modest change. Could you walk through that, or you can just say there was no change. 
George Reyes
It was a very, very modest change from the 134 to the 183 here. 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thank you very much. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Eric, I wondered if you could comment a little bit about some of the tweaks to the algorithm during the quarter. In particular, do you take something like the words Bear Stearns and you type them into Google versus typing them into Yahoo!, you notice that you're not monetizing as much as you did. You go back a year or so ago, there was a lot of buzz around a third link. I think you have made some of these changes maybe in the middle of the quarter. 
Could you talk about what you saw as far as impacts on CPC, pricing, as you sort of scale back your inventory on keywords you were selling, click through rates and ultimately revenue. Part of that as well is, you also reduced some of the minimum CPC pricing to more tail-like turns. If you could quantify how you see those changes impacting maybe a more full Q in Q2 and going forward? 
Eric Schmidt
Jonathan, why don't you handle it? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I'm not sure I can quantify it too much for you, but I can try to give you a sense philosophically of what we have been doing and some of the changes that we actually implemented. As you know, we have been upgrading the quality component into ads from the start, and we have been building on that with fairly robust quality improvements almost every quarter since. This quarter was obviously no exception. 
Some of the type of changes that you're talking about, specifically the ones that we implemented in mid-February which we announced, were the quality-based bidding changes. Basically what those did was improve the quality score algorithm that generates more accurate quality scores and predictions, particularly in some of the cases where we have limited data. So there are a lot of situations maybe a lot of people don't search a lot on Bear Stearns. We have done a better job of figuring out for some subset of those words how to tweak the quality-based scores. That was certainly significant. 
One of the things that made it even more significant was that we added to the front end of AdWords the ability to give advertisers transparency into their quality so that they could see whether or not particular words were poor, okay or great. That actually allowed the results to improve pretty substantially. That certainly had a real impact during the quarter, although it was only implemented midway through the quarter in February. 
There are just a couple of others which I can touch on real quickly. We also announced that we changed the background color on the top ads to yellow. We also changed the area in which people click so that people are less likely to click if they are not actually trying to click on the ad. These types of things are also important. 
Landing page quality I think is another thing we have been working on. Beyond that, it is basically just many changes to the ad systems. You can derive the CPCs to the extent that you want by looking at the paid click number which George announced.

Your next question comes from Anthony Noto – Goldman Sachs. 
 Anthony Noto – Goldman Sachs 
Thank you very much. Eric, I was wondering if you could comment at the management level as you make investments, what measurement do you look at holistically for the company as a return-based measurement to ensure that the overall business and overall shareholders are seeing an aggregated return from each of the individual investments? 
The reason for my question is I know that you have launched a lot of initiatives: Google Checkout, Gmail, Google Finance, that may not necessarily have a unique revenue stream tied to them that is large, but does provide ancillary benefits to the overall platform. Are you incented on that return metric? 
The second question is, we tracked your revenue per employee on a gross basis. Up until the fourth quarter of 2005, gross revenue per employee had been growing in the single-digit range. Since then it has been declining, in fact down 12% year-over-year this quarter. I recognize that is because you're adding more new employees that are not productive. At what point do you think your existing employee base is large enough that your new employees do not cause your gross revenue per employee to decline? 
Eric Schmidt
An interesting series of questions. We don't approach the questions quite the same way that you phrased them. Our primary focus is on end user happiness, end user traffic, end user growth. So what we look at is we look at what will drive even more end users using our product globally. So, for example, if we could bring out a product that will cause people to use Google and its various applications that much more and they spend more and more of their day using Google services, that allows us to eventually monetize that. So we do not insist on a direct link from say a product that does not get revenue to one that does. In the cases that you cited, we look at the revenue contribution. But the primary focus and the primary management focus is around end user happiness, end user growth, end user everything. 
With respect to the revenue per headcount, again we are not very focused on that. We are much more focused in total growth of the platform, total growth of the number of advertisers, total growth of the monetization. It is easy enough for us to dial any particular metric like employees per gross revenue up or down as we see fit. It is more important to focus on end user happiness. A lot of the people we are talking about are, for example, coming in for customer service globally. We are also way, way investing in engineering because we believe this is a time where our model is scaling that products that we are going to bring out in a year or two are going to have huge impacts to the investments we're making in data centers, and we need the engineers to build the great products to do so.

Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth - Lehman Brothers. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
I was hoping you could comment on toolbar activity. If we look at third-party data, it suggests that toolbar growth is driving north of 40% of total growth in search queries, which clearly validates your distribution strategy. But I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of the behavior pattern for users with downloaded toolbars, not just right after they get the toolbar but over a little bit of time. Does it make you concerned at all that we could be seeing sort of a one-time spike from this initial bigger distribution of toolbars? Thank you. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Certainly a big story in the quarter is traffic, and a component of the traffic performance is certainly toolbar. No question toolbar users search more than non-toolbar users. I can’t really comment on the degree to which the growth rates would be dependent on the number of remaining users out there who could also use toolbar, but we can certainly say that your hypothesis is correct, that toolbar users search significantly more. 
Larry Page
I was just going to add, we have been distributing toolbars for a long time and have had a very successful product there for a long time. I don't think there has been any huge changes over the last quarter or two in people's behavior or those mechanisms.

Your next question comes from Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley. 
Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley
Thanks. One of the things that we are seeing in the market right now is it feels as though we are seeing an acceleration in the migration from offline advertising to online advertising. Eric, you talked in your opening remarks about your deal with Clear Channel, your deal with EchoStar; obviously others. Obviously they are early stage. But we are frankly surprised that you're able to announce such large deals as quickly as you have been able to do that. 
Do you think that we will see a lot more of those in the next six months? When we add them all up at the end of 2008 and we look at the financial impact to Google, do you think it could be at a level where it is actually material as quickly as the end of 2008? Thanks. 
Omid Kordestani
Your observation is correct. We are very busy in the partnership area and very much so also globally. I think what we are seeing is that again the power of the platform and the interest in tapping into, depending on what kind of partner you are, both the advertiser network and the publishing network is very, very interesting for people. That again, this push to a more efficient measurability is of great interest to everyone, be it in the print sector, audio or TV. I think what everybody is really trying to figure out is where do their put their own resources, just like Google did awhile back where we focused our field operations on more Fortune companies. 
I think the TV companies, print companies, they are all trying to apply their resources to their area of their own expertise and then utilize our ability to drive a lot of revenue and targetability and measurability. So we're finding great interest. It is very competitive, the market is very competitive, and on a global basis, we're just again doing the best we can to staff up both partnerships with legal and finance to be able to model these deals and be able to have the right partnerships in place. So yes, I would say you are going to see us be very much focused on this space.

Your next question comes from Ben Schachter - UBS. 
 Ben Schachter - UBS 
Congratulations on a nice quarter. Can you talk at a high level on Google's view of cookie data and third-party ad serving? Now that you own DoubleClick, do you think it is more likely that you will open up the network to third-party ad serving? Thanks. 
Eric Schmidt
I will let Larry and Sergey. 
Larry Page
I think that in general we are really excited about opportunities to improve some of the practices that are in place there with regards to people's privacy, but also while improving targetability and the kinds of information you need to really provide good information to everybody involved in the process. So I think we're excited about our ability, our technological strength and how it can be applied to some of those issues. We're not ready to go into any specifics on that yet.

Your next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch. 
 Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Could you talk a little bit about TAC? Obviously you saw the percentage or the percent of network increase quarter over quarter. Is the mix of who your partners are changing a lot? Did a couple of partners ramp up, and how do you see that going forward? A little more comment on that. 
And then on the distribution partner side, is that fully in your numbers now, or are there still more partners ramping up there for future quarters? 
George Reyes
The answer is that we're doing a lot more deals and the deals are, in fact, carrying a disproportionate amount of TAC. So, at the end of the day and I think I suggested that in my earlier comments, TAC as a percentage of revenue is likely to increase given the deals that we're doing these days. 
 Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Was there a partner that specifically ramped up in the quarter? 
George Reyes
I can’t comment on that. Generally I think the TAC rates are going up directionally. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Imran Khan – JP Morgan. 
 Imran Khan – JP Morgan 
Thank you very much for taking my question. Your paid click growth rate in Q1 was 52%. I think it was down from 61% in the fourth quarter. Can you please help us to understand if that growth rate decline was due to query volume growth rate decline or click-through improvement? Also, do you have any contra revenue from Google Checkout? 
Eric Schmidt
George could specifically answer the contra-revenue question with respect to Checkout. From a marketing perspective, Q4 was seasonally more significant in terms of the marketing efforts that we were doing. He can give you the specific accounting implications. 
The other specific question relates to paid clicks and click-throughs? 
 Imran Khan – JP Morgan 
Yes, so basically paid click growth rate declined from 61% to 52%. Is it driven by query volume growth decline, or there was an anniversary of click-through improvement that you made in the past? 
Eric Schmidt
Query volume was very healthy. I think we already mentioned that. Q1 is typically a somewhat weaker seasonal quarter from a monetization perspective, although George mentioned in his prepared remarks that there are some exceptions internationally, particularly in the UK. Beyond that, I would not be too much into an aggregate CPC measure as we have talked about in the past. Country mix, property mix as the previous question alluded to, had significant impact on how that shakes out. Clicks are extremely healthy as well. 
George Reyes
On the Checkout question, you have to sort of stand back. We really peaked seasonally in the Christmas season and right now the business is going, but it is not going at a seasonally strong rate at this point in time. So we are bullish on Checkout, and the contra revenue range will probably be somewhere around 1% of revenues or thereabouts. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Brian Pitz - Bank of America. 
 Brian Pitz - Bank of America 
Thank you. First, a broader industry question. When you look at the UK market, a lot of data suggests that market is growing very substantially and north of 40%, and now represents about 11% of total ad spend is now online versus the U.S., we estimate about 5.5%. Can you talk about what is fundamentally different about that market or what is going on there that is driving those higher growth rates? 
Just a quick follow-up: you mentioned earlier on the call growth and investment in content. Any sense there what type of content or areas you may be interested in? Thanks. 
Omid Kordestani
In terms of the UK question, we're definitely seeing very strong performance there. I think it is driven by our leadership team and having put a lot of focus in both reaching out to our clients, as well as advertising agencies, focus on named accounts. We're seeing increases in average spend, significant increases in that focusing on the different vertical strategies and making sure we understand the seasonality of those just as we mentioned earlier. Probably saw finance and travel bounce back, and in Q4, for example, we very much paid attention to how to deal with that seasonality and that helped us in Q4 as well. 
So we just think again the economy is very strong there. The sales team and the leadership is very strong, and just our ability to execute our strategy is working well. There is also strong interest in the new ad formats and also, as we mentioned, deals like BBC, were some of the very interesting deals we were able to establish. 
In terms of content, I think in general some of the spending we're doing is improving our product areas. For example, spending in mapping services and mapping data and some of the partnerships we established. But I don't think there is anything unusual there other than just our focus in improving both the products and expanding partnerships. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Just adding to Omid's comments, the two other things that I have noticed in the UK are that early on the agencies were particularly aggressive with the online medium, and that really helped spur the early growth when it was in its more nascent stages which has carried over. I think some of the other observations that I have seen just in the marketing literature are that there is a relative lack of TV advertising there because the BBC is so popular. And so they were much quicker to move their spending to other outlets and try things more quickly and then discovered that the ROI was high. 
Eric Schmidt
And George, you wanted to add something, didn't you? 
George Reyes
I just wanted to clarify that comment on Checkout. On Google Checkout basically we are less than 1% of where we were in the holiday quarter. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel. 
 Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel 
I was wondering if you could discuss some of these offline ad partnerships with regard to your view as to whether or not you can get beyond remnant? Clearly the Clear Channel deal was less than 5% of their inventory. Or it is a really just about redefining remnant for some of these markets? Clearly we have also seen the eBay upfront auction not working very well. So I was just wondering if you could discuss that. 
And then also I think last quarter you indicated that coverage rates were down. I was wondering if you could comment on them this quarter. 
Eric Schmidt
One thing to clarify is that the Clear Channel deal includes a lot of premium inventory. It is not a remnant deal. That is a misperception. Maybe we did not communicate that very well. The EchoStar, similarly, those our primary spots. That is why those two deals are so important. It launches these two new initiatives right in front of the primetime viewer. 
Omid Kordestani
I would add that we really look for also how the partnerships would like to start with us. I think we are confident that we are very good at monetization given the diversity of our network and the ability of targetability. So each partnership is different, depending on their own sales capabilities and how they like to work with us. We really want to be flexible and find where we can add value to these partnerships. 
Eric Schmidt
I'm sorry, what is the other question? 
 Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel 
I think you guys indicated that coverage was actually down in Q4, and I was just wondering if you could characterize what it looked like in Q1? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Coverage of what? 
 Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel 
Ad coverage on the site. It sounded like you were reducing the coverage as a whole. 
Eric Schmidt
Sure. We're showing fewer ads, and those fewer ads are worth more because they are better targeted. Jonathan? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes, I think what Eric said is correct. Many of the improvements that you are seeing from a quality perspective are improvements that are basically reducing the total number of ads and increasing the click-through rates. That has really been the hallmark of the ad's quality initiative. We have been layering them on, as I have said each quarter, quarter after quarter. So the improvements that we came out with in quarters past are further implemented in future quarters and then again this quarter, as I mentioned, we implemented a number primarily in the middle of the quarter. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse. 
 Heath Terry - Credit Suisse 
I was wondering if you could give us an idea -- to the extent that you have this data and can share it -- of your search users, what percentage are actually using multiple Google products? Using Mail, using Froogle, using Orkut, one of the other offerings that you have got? How much, when you look at usage of that entire Google universe as a whole, what percentage of it at this point would you qualify as being non-search? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Probably the most significant change that we have seen there is that we have done a much better job recently of providing a unified login across all of the Google properties. So now what we're seeing is that users who log in tend to use their Google login regardless of which property they are logging in with, and that has manifested itself in terms of one experience that lets us really add a lot of value with personalization, which Larry mentioned, we're doing significantly. So we're seeing much, much better integration. 
In terms of actual percentages of use on different products, we really don't separate the data out that way. But we're starting to see much, much better integration and we are also starting a number of efforts that will make things like one box show up more frequently, as Larry mentioned, so that you will see the information in context and sharing of things like addresses and other functionality across all of the products to make it a much more seamless and integrated experience.

Your next question comes from Jordan Rohan - RBC Capital Markets. 
 Jordan Rohan - RBC Capital Markets 
Great, thank you. Reports out of the National Association of Broadcasters Conference indicates that Google was supposedly very close to introducing a content filtering system, perhaps called Claim Your Content for use on YouTube and Google Video. Does this keep copyrighted content from being posted or make it easier to remove? How might major studios or content producers prove ownership of intellectual property? Thank you. 
Eric Schmidt
Those reports did not quite get the gist of what we -- and in particular I -- said. Google is building a tool which is called Claim Your Content, and it allows publishers to somewhat automate the takedown process. It is not a filtering system. The technology does not block uploads. It makes it much, much more effective and much quicker to download, essentially to get us to remove inappropriately uploaded content. It is very much compliant with the DMCA, and we believe we will address many of the operational complaints people are making about the workload that the DMCA has put on them. So we're trying to make that work, and we think it addresses the vast majority of all those complaints. 
 Jordan Rohan - RBC Capital Markets 
How do studios prove ownership of the intellectual property? 
Eric Schmidt
There is a mechanism where they work with us to show that, and again these tools are just beginning and over the next year, those mechanisms will get better and better. 
Operator
Due to time constraints we have time for one final question. Your final question comes from Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Co. 
 Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Co 
Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could speak to the disparity in monetization between domestic and international, outside of the UK? You may not want to quantify it, but if you can just look at the disparity that you had last year versus this year, by how much has it shrunk, if it has? I'm assuming that it hasn’t. 
Can you get to parity over time? Because if that is the case then you guys may be in position to actually show revenue growth – [inaudible], sorry. 
Eric Schmidt
I'm not sure I completely agree with some of the premise of that. We do expect that the international percentage of our global revenue will eventually be greater than 50%. International is getting close already, and that has been one of our strategic goals. It is fundamentally a function of the distribution of worldwide ad dollars, and there is only so much of a percentage in any particular market of worldwide ad spending that we can get. 
Do you want to characterize, Jonathan, the difference in international between leading markets like the UK and some of the other ones, is the gap getting closer? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes, I think the way I would look at it is I would look at the strength of revenue in the U.S. and the UK as a proxy for the opportunity set in each of those other countries. The next best thing to look at is the total amount of e-commerce which exists in any individual country. Obviously the more e-commerce, the more likely you're going to see significant monetization opportunities. 
We have done a lot of effort looking at the correlation between GDP, Internet host, number of computers. My impression is it is generally driven by the big macroeconomic factors and that is where you're going to see the highest correlations. Some of the much more nascent countries still do have very, very low monetization rates. 
Eric Schmidt
It is time to finish up. So let me end first by saying thank you all for spending so much time listening to what we are up to, covering us and helping us get the message out. 
Again, as I reflect on the quarter and as I reflect on what we have talked about today, Google is very much benefiting from the growth rate of the industry and the model that we are using to grow with it or ahead of it. The industry is large. It is growing quickly. All of the players are doing a great job of making the Internet and the online and offline experiences even more effective. 
We have also benefited from the very, very hard work of an awful lot of publishers, agencies and advertisers who are using tools that can be improved over time. We are investing a lot of money and time to build better platforms, better communities for them. All of this is in pursuit of our goal around end users, making the information that people want accessible to them exactly when and where they want it on the device and in whatever country and language that they choose to be in or that they just care about. 
So the model is working, and this is a scale business and the scale looks very, very good to us. So with that, thank you very, very much for all your time and let's go ahead and we will talk to you in three months.

Eric Schmidt
Thanks very much, Kim. Business continues to be very, very good here at Google and we are very happy to present another very strong performance from the company. In thinking about it, we're going to talk a little bit in our remarks as well as in your questions -- and thank you so very much for those ahead of time -- about a number of themes which I wanted to highlight. 
Global expansion of Google: it turns out that we are gaining share, according to most third-party data analysis, in almost every country. Our international businesses have contributed a significant financial component to our revenue, our profits, as well as our advertising and we expect that to continue. What is interesting is we are also beginning to develop the partnerships that are appropriate for a global company. So for example, we did our first large access deal with BSkyB in the United Kingdom in the same quarter. 
Our focus around new product development, 70/20/10 and the other things that we've talked about, has continued and indeed our leadership in search and ads continues; it's always wonderful. We have a much larger, higher quality search index in essentially all languages. We continue to search new types of content: books, code, patents, news archives, in all sorts of interesting new ways. We are showing fewer ads per search on a much higher quality and much better monetization. So again, the targeting and the technical work that we are doing is producing better return for advertisers, better revenue for us, with even fewer advertisements on a comparison basis. We are experimenting with new ad formats. 
Google is the innovator in many online products: maps, personalized home page, docs and spreadsheets and our products there. We are doing very, very well in mobile search. Of course, we have a very thorough and complete prioritization process that now allows us to understand how to deploy all these resources going forward. 
Another theme that occurred in the quarter which we will highlight has to do with our message around partnerships. We've been talking about this for a while. But overall, if you look, the partnerships that we announced last year are all kicking in and you are beginning to see the benefit of having such distinguished partnerships. An example of such a partnership is, of course, the YouTube acquisition which we are running now as largely a separate business, which is growing very quickly. But the OEM partnerships that we announced are also beginning to kick in. KDDI, China Mobile and other mobile partnerships are also working well for us. The transparency message that we have been pushing is working in that people understand what we are doing and want to work with us. 
A big priority for the company over the next while is the issue of growing the company. The long-term organizational structure, the human resource that we have managed to build, has tremendous potential, needs management focus, needs growth and training and so forth, and all of that is in place. What is interesting now is we are taking the learnings from our United States and UK sales models, for example, and globalizing those; and again, getting the leverage and the learning that we've had from these mature markets to the emerging markets. 
So to sum all of that up, Google is now presenting a much larger business mission. Many more kinds of end users with more information, more personalized services; many more partners, partners who use Google platforms to offer either their own services or ones branded by Google. We're talking to advertisers about using Google for all of our advertising incentives, not just text search, and that is going well. Vendors are using products like Google Checkout, which is doing well for us, and other services to speed commercial transactions. Developers are beginning to develop on top of Google as a platform play and using the services that Google provides to make amazing new products that really do change the world. Of course, in the media industries, because of YouTube and the success we're having in general, our role with respect to monetization and partnering with them is a story yet to come and one which we are very excited about. 
So with that, it's probably best to go directly to George to take us through the financials. 
George Reyes
Thanks, Eric and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our performance in Q4, which demonstrated strength across Google and our network business and across the world. In addition to our solid results, we've continued successfully executing on our strategy to build an organization for the long term, with significant investments in our employees and in our infrastructure. We are truly a global company and we are scaling aggressively to meet the needs of our users all over the world. 
I will now turn to some details of the quarter. Gross revenues for the fourth quarter were $3.2 billion, reflecting growth of 67% over Q4 of last year. As in previous years, the fourth quarter was characterized by strong growth in traffic, primarily due to the holiday shopping season. 
In addition, continued monetization gains and ads' quality improvements positively affected revenue growth. Revenue from Google properties was just under $2 billion, representing 62% of total revenue, and year-over-year growth of 80%. Google properties revenue was driven primarily by healthy gains in traffic, as well as growth due to improvements in monetization. 
AdSense revenues came in at $1.2 billion, representing 37% of total revenue and year-over-year growth of 50%. Our AdSense business also experienced significant traffic gains, driven by strong performance among many of our larger AdSense research partners, as well as on our AdSense for Content network. In addition, ads quality changes, including enhancements to our content ads targeting system, contributed to growth in AdSense for Content. 
This quarter, we're going to provide some additional data on paid clicks, which include clicks related to ads served on Google, Google properties, as well as through our partners. Aggregate paid clicks grew approximately 61% over Q4 of last year and approximately 22% over Q3. 
Turning to Checkout, we're very pleased that Google Checkout adoption rates exceeded our expectations in Q4. I'd also like to note that our recent consumer promotions for Google Checkout during the quarter were accounted for as a reduction to both Google sites and network revenues in accordance with GAAP. 
Now turning to a geographic breakdown of revenues, the U.S. posted revenue of nearly $1.8 billion, driven largely by seasonal traffic gains from a strong holiday season, with particular strength in the retail vertical. International revenue was $1.4 billion, representing 44% of total revenue. Our growth in international revenues demonstrates that the investments we're making abroad, including the development of cross-functional regional offices around the world, are paying off handsomely. International revenues also benefited from favorable currency trends. 
Our European markets performed especially well this quarter. Germany and France in particular experienced significant strength, with solid performance in the retail vertical. The UK exhibited its typical seasonal pattern, declining modestly as a percentage of total revenues from 16% in Q3 to 15% at $469 million. The UK experienced similar softness in the travel and finance verticals, just as it did last year. 
We also continue to be very pleased with the growth we're seeing in our smaller European markets, such as Ireland, Benelux, Eastern Europe, and are likewise seeing very encouraging growth in Asia and the Pacific region, as well as Latin America, Australia and Brazil. 
Traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, were $976 million. The majority of TAC is related to the amounts ultimately paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled $916 million. TAC also consists of amounts paid to certain distribution partners, which totaled $60 million in Q4. As we grow our distribution and AdSense partner network and embark upon new initiatives like audio and video ads, we may see additional pressure on TAC rates. 
Turning to cost of revenue, the increases in cost of revenue were primarily driven by increases in depreciation expense related to our data centers. Going forward, we anticipate that other costs of sales will increase due to rising depreciation expense and credit card fees associated with both AdWords and Checkout. 
Operating expenses in Q4 included $134 million in stock-based compensation and totaled $862 million. These included $493 million in payroll-related and facilities expenses, which were the greatest drivers of OpEx this quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock-based compensation, grew to $1.2 billion, with non-GAAP operating margins of 37%, down from 38% in Q3. 
Looking forward, we expect to continue investing heavily in our business. You should expect continued growth in headcount across functions and across the world. We also expect continued investments in AdSense partnerships, distribution partners and content. 
Changing gears and topics, in December we announced a new innovative compensation program to attract and retain the world's best talent. We currently anticipate that we will implement our employee transferable stock option plan, or TSO program, in Q2. Since all outstanding stock options will be modified to allow selling during the program, we preliminarily estimate a modification charge in accordance with GAAP of approximately $90 million in Q2 related to vested options as of the end of the quarter and a charge of approximately $160 million over the remaining vesting periods of up to about four years related to unvested options. For more details on these estimates of the stock-based compensation related to this TSO program, please refer to our press release. 
Before the incremental charges related to the TSO program, we currently estimate stock-based compensation charges or grants to employees prior to January 1 2007 to be approximately $621 million in 2007. 
Turning to a favorite topic of ours, capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $367 million, bringing total capital expenditures for 2006 to $1.9 billion. The majority of our CapEx is related to IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers and networking equipment. Our leadership in search and ads is a direct result of our relentless focus on building the most robust platforms for our users. As we scale, our business increasingly requires substantial computational power. 
In 2007, we expect to make significant capital expenditure investments. It is important to point out that the strategy of aggressively investing in our infrastructure has paid off handsomely and remains critical to our success, and we intend to follow this strategy for the foreseeable future. 
Now turning to cash, operating cash flow was $911 million. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, which we define as cash flow from operations less CapEx, increased to $544 million. Our tax rate was affected by two discrete items. Last month, we entered into an advanced pricing agreement, or APA, with the IRS related to certain inter-company transfer pricing arrangements. We also realized a benefit to our income tax provision related to the 2006 R&D tax credit. 
Without these applicable discrete items, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%, and for the year was 26%. Without these applicable discrete items, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24% -- I apologize, I just repeated myself. Our effective tax rate will be greater in 2007 under the APA than it would have been without it. However, we expect our effective tax rate for 2007 to be at or below 30%. Please refer to our press release for more details. 
So to conclude, we had a very healthy Q4 across the company and we continue to execute on our strategy of building a great company. So now I will turn it over to Larry. 
Larry Page
Thanks, George, and hello, everybody. I am very excited about our results for this quarter. As always, serving our users was our number one priority this past quarter. We know that when we take care of our users, the whole Google ecosystem flourishes. 
I'd like to first talk about search performance. Now, there's five different dimensions of search performance that I want to talk about. One is the number of current user queries, the response time, the size of index, the document update frequency, and the complexity and sophistication of the ranking algorithms. We continue to invest in a global infrastructure that supports our search system because that investment allows us to improve performance among all these dimensions. As a result, we can now handle more user queries and respond more quickly. 
Our index is substantially larger and is updated more often, and the system supports ranking algorithms that are more computationally expensive and deliver better results to the user. 
Since users are interested in many types of information, we expanded our search index to include new types of content. We added the ability to search for code in more than 40 different programming languages and indexed more than 7 million U.S. patents. Google Video search now links to YouTube content and with that acquisition, over time, we will integrate the YouTube platform with our search engine. 
To make this range of information more useful, we are working on integrating different types of results -- video, images, news, books and so on -- all in one place. We are now blending book results into the main index and we will add more going forward. We are excited about providing a truly seamless user experience in search. 
Users also value the great innovation and flexibility driven by the open standards of the Internet era. Personalized home page users are now using over 10,000 gadgets, almost all of them developed outside of Google. This is one reason why usage of personalized search grew so much. We launched Google Gadgets to your web page, so webmasters can place some of those gadgets on their own sites as well. We merged docs and spreadsheets, and adoption grew rapidly. Users are increasingly taking advantage of the collaborative powers of hosting and sharing their work on the web. 
Our users also need to reach us on multiple devices from any location, so mobile and global markets are an integral part of everything we do. We signed new partnership with companies such as China Mobile, Samsung, SK Telecom and Apple. We also launched a mobile application for Gmail and a GPS-enabled version of Maps with our partner Helio. 
Google Search now supports localized results in over 55 countries. We made improvements to our search quality across all languages and particularly in German and Japanese. Well over half our traffic and a large portion of revenue comes from outside the U.S., so we know these efforts are paying off. 
We opened engineering facilities in Poland, Russia, Denmark and Korea. These new offices, like our other international locations, have amazing engineers who can create new features, not only for their local markets, but for everyone else, too. 
Now I will let Sergey fill you in on what we're doing to support the rest of the Google ecosystem, our advertisers and partners. 
Sergey Brin
Thanks, Larry. I'm going to talk about advertisers, partners and a number of improvements we made in our monetization. First of all, our ad systems. We focus not just on making money, but also on the ad quality. Ad quality has been something that we have been working on since launch of our ad system, known as AdWords Express back then, in 2002. 
In the fourth quarter, we continue to enhance our ad matching by eliminating ads from some of our less commercial queries while showing more ads on commercially-oriented searches. As a result, the percentage of queries that receive ads have gone down by several points, but monetization has improved. These are the kinds of improvements that we make all the time and really improve both the quality and the monetization of our system. 
We also released an upgrade of our landing page quality system. This removes the low-quality landing pages from our ad results and improves users' experience after they leave Google and click on an ad. This in turn encourages users to click on more ads, because they have better and more useful content when they do so. 
The same user-focused approach works for partners, too. Our enhanced content targeting platform for AdSense significantly improved ad relevance. This means a better experience for users, better performance for advertisers, and more revenue for partners and for Google. We also launched the custom search engines. This way, partners can embed a tailored search engine on their site that provides a richer user experience. 
In sum total, we paid over $3 billion in 2006 to our partners. This is a figure that we expect is going to increase as we ramp up our video, radio and print programs. Advertisers are now using our targeting platform to place brand advertising across our content network, and they're going to have more branding options as the YouTube inventory comes online. 
In 2006, we expanded offline ads. We rolled out audio with radio stations, and print with over 50 newspaper partners. The ability to offer premium online and offline inventory, along with the control and analytics to optimize it, puts us in a position to provide a complete sales and marketing platform for all advertisers. 
In June, we launched Google Checkout to give our users a better, secure, more efficient way to shop online and the feedback has been positive. We regularly survey our users to gauge their satisfaction, and we are pleased with the feedback we're hearing about Checkout. In a recent survey using third party data, eight out of ten Checkout users described their experience as good or very good. Our fourth quarter marketing investments paid off, with dramatic growth of the user base, and repeat usage stayed strong, which is a good measure of convenience and ease of use. 
Checkout yielded good results for merchants too, who benefited from higher conversion rates and free transaction processing. In the six months since Checkout's launch, thousands of small and medium merchants have signed up, and we now have more than 20% of the Web's top 500 retailers. That list includes ToysRUs, Linens 'n Things, Petco and Buy.com, and there are many more you can all see for yourselves on checkout.Google.com. We expect this momentum to continue as we expand Checkout beyond the U.S. and deepen integration with other products. 
On an even more important note, I would like to talk about our unique culture and energy that we have been not only preserving, but even enhancing since our startup days. Our new transferable stock options will help by letting us continue to attract and retain talented people. We are proud to have been selected by Fortune as the number one best place to work in 2007. Fortune highlighted the usual Googley things like our free food, beanbags and lava lamps. But what is not apparent from the outside is the set of rigorous systems and processes that we use to manage our growth while maintaining this entrepreneurial zeal. As we grow in size and expand to new locations, we never forget that we are global citizens entrusted with taking care of users worldwide. 
I look forward to taking your questions. For now, it is back to Eric. 
Eric Schmidt
Well thanks, Sergey. So in thinking about this and listening to the folks, a question that comes to mind is, what is the key to our success? I think it is search. Search is getting better and better as we continue to innovate across the globe. Our employee base has grown, and in a very positive way. We have a great group of engineers and developers and employees who are able to share and communicate and contribute essentially new and innovative ideas and approaches. So we are able to continue to provide the most relevant information available on the web. 
The strength of our ability to target this personal information continues to improve based on user feedback, better technology, et cetera, and this results in our advertisers being able to spend in the most effective way to contribute to everyone's bottom line positively. The net effect, of course, is strong revenue growth, good advertiser satisfaction and a real value to the end user. 
Our partnerships, of course, are growing very nicely, benefiting both our customers and partners, and everybody is getting to know us better and better. MySpace, Apple, Samsung, China Mobile, others we haven't mentioned, all doing well with many more content partnerships coming in 2007. 
So at Google, we are very proud to be providing access to the world's information. We are committed to investing heavily in our people, innovation, creativity and fostering new ideas for our business model and products. We are also extremely proud to continue to deliver tangible results that exceed what we believe we would be able to do, with our commitments to technology, customers, advertisers and partnerships. 
We will obviously continue to evolve those relationships as we need to. And our commitment is to provide the most relevant information across the board in a personalized and targeted way across any device. What you want, when you want it and how you want it. 
With that, thank you very much, and Kim, maybe we can go to questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Anthony Noto – Goldman Sachs. 
Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much; also, thank you for the paid click growth rates. My question pertains to that. 22% sequential growth in paid clicks, but gross revenue grew 19% sequentially. I was wondering if you could bridge the gap for us. Was price down sequentially per lead, or is that Google contra-revenues? Can you give us any clarity on that difference? Thank you. 
Eric Schmidt
 Let me add that we are asking Jonathan Rosenberg and Omid Kordestani to join us, as we have historically. Jonathan, you are probably the expert at this. 
 Jonathan Rosenberg
 Sure, Anthony. I will let George address the contra-revenue piece. But I think the thing that you really need to look at when you look at the sequential growth, if you really want to get a measure of price to look at the health of the industry, you need to come up with something that is like a CPI or a Dow Jones index so that you are comparing apples to apples, quarter to quarter. 
There are a bunch of other things that impact CPC. Probably the biggest is growth rates. In emerging markets versus developed markets, you basically have the dynamic that the newer markets have lower prices. So what that tends to do is, since they're faster growth, that tends to put downward pressure on CPC. There's another dynamic that you have in terms of Google.com, which has actually been growing faster than the other properties and has a higher CPC, so that actually puts a little bit of upward pressure on CPC. On the other hand, with that AdSense for Content, we're adding a lot of social network-type traffic in, particularly with the MySpace deal. So that puts downward pressure on the dynamic. 
There's also a lot of other dynamics, particularly during the holidays, where the advertisers are searching very aggressively for more keywords that can allow them to get more leads. When they do that, they tend to find some of the previously undiscovered keywords, so they get lower CPC keywords. 
So there's a whole combination there. There's no data that suggests that on an apples-to-apples basis, we are seeing a decline in CPCs of like keywords. So those are the other dynamics that make the equation work out with respect to the 22% versus the 19%. 
 George Reyes
Basically, we had a very good session with our Ernst & Young accounting firm and this was back a few months ago. We clearly agreed with their position that these Google Checkout transactions were going to be accounted as contra-revenue. That is the appropriate GAAP accounting treatment for it. So that is why we have shared that with you. 
 Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
 Could you give us a sense of the magnitude? 
 George Reyes
 At this point, it's on the order of magnitude of 1% or thereabouts. 
 Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
 So it hurt your sequential growth by 1%? Or 1% of your total revenue? 
 George Reyes
 The latter. 
 Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Thank you.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup. 
 Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
I also want to follow up on Google Checkout. You talked a little bit about the cost. Can you talk about the returns you're seeing on Checkout in particularly two areas? To what extent you've seen merchants spend more with Google because of the facilitation this has had of their ecommerce business? Or what impact it's had on users in terms of their willingness to chase the badge or to look at Checkout promotions and to take advantage of those opportunities? Thank you. 
Sergey Brin
I don't have data on the first of your questions, but on the latter, we know that users are drawn to Checkout badges. There are varying implementations and in some cases, as long as we make it clear enough to users that Google Checkout is there and they can more efficiently complete their transaction, we've seen substantial increases in their likelihood of both clicking on the ad and then subsequently a significant improvement on the conversion rate. 
Jonathan, do you want to add anything to that? 
 Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure. Basically the dynamic, Mark, since we are in many cases increasing the clickthrough rate for the advertisers, they're basically getting better ROI, and they're also lowering their transaction processing costs. So there's a couple of dynamics that create a pretty significant incentive for them. 
They're also, I think, discovering that Checkout facilitates the buying process which means more sales for them. So basically, most of them are beginning to think about Google as a sales channel rather than a marketing expense. Since what they care about is conversions, we expect that they will continue to invest in channels that help them increase their conversions. Most of the data that we're hearing from the vast majority of the partners would so indicate. I think we actually just announced today the addition of Blue Nile, so we are continuing to see very positive growth, particularly with the larger online retailers.

Your next question comes from Brian Pitz - Banc of America. 
 Brian Pitz - Banc of America
Thank you. A couple questions on mobile. You have made a number of mobile acquisitions such as Android and Dodgeball over the past year. Any information you could share with us in terms of new product launches around mobile? 
Secondly, thoughts on when mobile may actually be somewhat of an impactful revenue driver? Will we see anything in '07, or is this more of an '08 story and beyond? Maybe if you could even talk about the split of revenue. Is it going to be fee-based, mainly advertising we understand, but do you foresee any fee-based revenue in there as well for content? Thanks. 
Eric Schmidt
It is clear that 2007 will be the year that mobile search query traffic grows substantially. Our current model is to use targeted text ads and we have evidence that the monetization of those ads is higher than in non-mobile uses. So it looks like the advertising revenue on a per-search query is likely to be significantly higher on mobile than on non-mobile. 
As part of that, we are investing in new categories of using mobile devices. For example, YouTube content is being used and can be viewed on mobile devices in various partnerships that we're doing. Those are as much opportunistic for us, and they're not really driving revenue yet; although in theory, you could imagine a combination of video, video advertising on a mobile phone that would have the best entertainment value but also very, very high monetization rates. We're unlikely to split it out. It's not material today in a financial sense, and more importantly, it's still emerging. 
We are making a significant investment in technology around mobile because of the growth rate of mobile and the ultimate scale of that business. You won't really see its financial impact until '08.

Your next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns 
 Congratulations, guys. A quick question here on YouTube. Could you just maybe give us a feel for what the revenue run rate is and what was in the quarter and the margins on it? Could you comment a little bit about what Chad spoke about over the weekend, talking about revenue share? How exactly would that work with both the content owner and the publisher, even touching on audio fingerprints, and also on how you're going to stop uploading copywriting content? Thanks. 
Eric Schmidt
 So it's really a bunch of questions about how YouTube is working. We don't break out the YouTube revenue separately. Our primary focus with YouTube right now is user adoption. We are experimenting with various advertising models. User adoption and advertising are growing very quickly. So it looks like early returns about the justification around the acquisition, the calculations that we did all look very positive to us. We are very, very, very pleased. 
As part of that, we are running YouTube separately. Chad, of course, is both the founder and a brilliant leader, and he has been pushing very hard for the development of a model where ultimately the people who produce the content in fact do get some revenue coming back in various forms of sharing. We don't have a formal program around that, but you should expect this year we will begin to offer such programs. 
So the combination of the ability to share revenue with content partners; we're doing that both with traditional partners, but also with a new emergent category which we are very excited about, who are all on YouTube. The combination of the two could ultimately be a very significant large business for us. It is too early to know exactly when. 
With respect to things like the fingerprinting, one of the things that we are very concerned about is we want to respect the copyright ownership, especially the ownership issues and the authors of copyrighted works. We are in development of a number of technologies that will help us there: audio fingerprinting, video fingerprinting. It's in various stages of being rolled out. That is an area of big research in the computer science community and also a significant investment here at Google. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns 
Just on the advertising, Eric, how do you envision that? Is it more of a two-second roll? Is it a 30-second roll, or is it just a display ad near it? How should we think about it? 
Eric Schmidt
 The true answer is we are going to experiment with different alternatives. Pre-rolls have historically not made sense, and there's some evidence that the traditional pre-rolls people have done have not worked. But we are certainly looking at alternatives and variants on the pre-rolls as well as post-roll, and also in-context advertising. 
The real value we found with people who have produced copyrighted work and the reason that they want to talk to us and want to work with us is we're talking to their fans. We know who those fans are, and those fans come to them for the copyrighted information and that is a highly monetizable base, and that's very attractive to the copyright holder. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns 
Thank you.

Your next question comes from Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley. 
Dave Joseph - Morgan Stanley 
 It is Dave Joseph asking for both of us. Can you talk a little bit about the dMarc betas that I believe wrapped up during the quarter for radio and print ads? From what we heard, they were pretty successful and that they even ended early. And I was wondering what the next steps there might be and whether this might even be a revenue generator in 2007. 
 Omid Kordestani
Audio is one of the several new initiatives we are pursuing in the advertising area, as well as inventory acquisition. We are working hard on integrating the product functionality, the campaign management tools as well as the build out of the sales force and the partnership teams to acquire the proper amount of inventory. So again, it is early to tell on most of these initiatives their full impact on the financials, but we're making great progress with both the advertisers and the pursuit of great partnerships for inventory. 
 Jonathan Rosenberg
The only data that I would add is it was pretty robust in terms of scope with respect to the radio station affiliates. I believe we had over 700 radio stations in more than 200 metros in the network. So the scope was pretty significant. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray. 
 Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray 
Good afternoon and congratulations on a great quarter. Could you talk about your partnerships? Eric, you mentioned that these are starting to bear fruit. Could you give us some additional color to help us gauge that performance? If you look at the AdSense revenue, the growth of course is very strong, but hasn't been accelerating. Where are you in terms of in your cycle in reaping the profits from these partnerships? 
If I can give you a quick example, last year you increased monetization and we saw some really big improvements in your Q3 results and then kind of started to slow down. So can you give us a sense of where we are in terms of the benefits you could get from these new partnerships? 
 Omid Kordestani
Thanks for the comments. In general, we are very pleased with the broad activity we have, both in terms of direct partnerships that we established with the major content or search partners, as well as our online network. And on the AdSense search front, some of the major partnerships are really in place already worldwide. We are actively either pursuing the renewals or some of the few that we don't have, we are obviously very interested in pursuing. So I think you'll see a lot of stability there. There's actually some nice growth with some of these partners that are doing a lot of work in improving their search functionality and using either our services or their own, but using our monetization. 
In the case of the content, we're doing a lot to just improve the quality of the content network. So we undertook initiatives that on the one hand, improved the way we monetize the advertising on those content sites. On the other hand, the landing page quality had an impact, where it limited the performance in the network, so the two had a counteracting effect. 
So I think that's what you're seeing. You're just seeing stability on the search front; and on the content side, improvements in the quality is affecting that and again making it really stable instead of seeing a dramatic increase. But in terms of the coverage, we are doing really great. 
Eric Schmidt
 We saw significant revenue growth in our revenue partnerships, non-Google.com partnerships, in the quarter and we anticipate that that will continue.

Your next question comes from Ben Schachter - UBS. 
 Ben Schachter - UBS
I was wondering if you could give us an update on your interest in health care. You've been more vocal about intentions there and I was wondering if you can perhaps quantify the type of investment you might make in that space, and over what time horizon? 
And then also, George, last year one of the few numbers you gave some guidance on was that CapEx would grow faster than revenue. I was wondering if you could quantify what to expect in CapEx? 
Sergey Brin
 On the health care I just want to highlight our interest in health care is primarily driven by requests we have gotten with a number of both government NGOs and commercial entities in seeing if there could be the kind of IT improvements in health care that we have seen in search on the web with Google. 
We view health as very important. We'd like to contribute to that. It is not something that we are thinking of as something that we're looking to drive the P&L or whatnot. It is more about what can we do to contribute to that community. It is too early to say exactly what that might be. We are still investigating where we can make the most useful contribution. 
Eric Schmidt
 On the CapEx side, as long as we have a healthy, vibrant, growing business like we have today, we have no choice but to continue to invest in CapEx because it just regenerates more competitive advantage for us.

Your next question comes from Imran Khan – JP Morgan. 
Imran Khan – JP Morgan
A question about your globalization. I think you get almost 75% of the revenue from the U.S. and UK. I was wondering if you could give us some sense in terms of monetization of queries difference -- if not quantitatively, maybe qualitatively -- between U.S., UK and continental Europe? 
 Jonathan Rosenberg
The UK has been traditionally very, very strong; in fact, in some cases, stronger than in the continental United States. We do see this odd dynamic, particularly seasonally in the UK in the fourth quarter, where they kind of have the reverse effect than they do in the U.S., and we have talked about that in some previous calls. A lot of it just relates to the fact that they plan vacations a lot earlier, so travel and also the finance vertical tend to be a little less robust. 
When you move to the continent, the monetization does go down modestly, but in some of the areas where the ad systems have been for at least a few years, it's still very high, such as Germany. But beyond that, we haven't really broken out any color in terms of rank order of monetization. 
Eric Schmidt
 My general comment is that people are pretty much the same all around the world and that the differences that you see are really a function of both GDP growth, broadband penetration, the development rate of where they are in ecommerce. The UK performance has always been strong and it is probably true for many, many companies. Partly that is because of the nature of the decisions that were made five or ten years ago in the United Kingdom. 
There's every reason to believe that the similar structure in all of the countries that you listed, for example in Western Europe, are working very, very hard to adopt the same broadband policies, electronic commerce policies and so forth. In many of those countries we appear to have even higher market share than we do in the UK and so we should see significant positive results, as a result.

Your next question comes from Jordan Rohan - RBC Capital Markets. 
Jordan Rohan - RBC Capital Markets 
It has been reported in the past, right before you purchased YouTube or made the announcement of your intention to purchase YouTube, that YouTube actually cut some deals with Universal, Sony, BMG and Warner Music Group. How are those deals accounted for in terms of content licensees? In which line of the income statement might they be? Can you give us some idea if the rumored $50 million in total amount that was reported is in the right ballpark? 
Eric Schmidt
 We're not going to comment on specific rumors. The deals that you're referring to were done prior to the closing of the acquisition and they were accounted for in the acquisition accounting, essentially. YouTube is busy doing a whole bunch of interesting deals which we will account for in the proper way as they get signed. I would prefer that we not comment on any of the specific rumors during that time. 
It was important that the content deals that they did be done at the time so that we had clear issues with respect to copyright and so forth. They were very, very strategic for both us and for YouTube.

Your next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Could you help us understand your view on when you extend the Google ad platform to traditional media, what are some of the advantages you provide to advertisers? Is it going to be broader reach, better measurement, some pricing advantages? What do you see as your real advantage there as you enter traditional media going forward? 
 Omid Kordestani
Our focus is to really provide the widest reach possible, as well as the most efficient way to manage these campaigns across media. We're seeing already some of the early benefits of that. Last quarter, there were companies, our customers like Volvo, P&G and OfficeMax, as an example, that took advantage of our rich media-based advertising, both image ads and video ads. 
Just to give you a sense of this, one of our advertisers, Volvo, went to the content network. They created several custom channels to reach their specific target market, then they used local ad targeting, again, to refine it on a more geographic basis. 
With P&G, they had a very humorous and fun, click-to-play video advertising, and the fine-tuning that they could do with the online campaign at a moment's notice was really, really attractive to them. 
In the case of OfficeMax, they actually created a micro site in Google Video and then they syndicated their advertising to the content network through 6,000 sites. So it's really the power of this advertising platform and the publisher platform that lets the advertisers have a lot of control, take advantage of the wide audience, target it properly, and now use different ad formats, depending on their marketing objectives. 
 Jonathan Rosenberg
Just adding a couple of comments. If you think about accountability and an enabling measurement for radio, one of the things that we provide is real-time reports on exactly where the ad played and when it played. These are things that sound simple, but they are a pretty huge improvement over the way traditional radio reports, which aren't otherwise available until 12 weeks after the ads run had previously played out. 
The same thing is true of some of the efforts that we're doing in print with a bunch of the newspapers right now. It's much, much easier to bring automation and efficiency with the platform that we have and with the advertisers that we have in terms of getting the kind of a dashboard that most CMOs would like with respect to their campaign performance across all of the available media.

 First, you mentioned that Asia was starting to show some measure of performance. I was wondering if you could give us the percentage of the mix of internationally? Second is more of a philosophical question with regard to YouTube in that you are keeping Google Video as a search destination; but could YouTube ultimately become your destination media brand? How do you think about that in terms of the broader context of media, and would you start getting into content or would you only see yourselves in revenue share? I'm just trying to get a philosophical view there. 
Eric Schmidt
 On the question of the international revenue, we typically don't break that sort of stuff out. On the question of YouTube, we're pushing very, very hard for the success of YouTube as a brand. It has tremendous traction with the demographic that we care about. An awful lot of people are now using YouTube every day in their daily lives. 
 Larry Page
 I think I alluded to this in my remarks, but I think we're taking our time to do the integration so that we preserve the value both of Google Video and of YouTube. We're starting to provide some integration there, but I think it is likely over time that we will continue to have both Google branding and YouTube branding. I think also there will be a lot of new things that happen in those areas and innovation. 
I don't think in general, we have not traditionally hired lots of people to make content. We have instead relied on getting a huge number of users to all the content in the world and in getting them to that seamlessly. I think we will still try to continue to do that.

Your next question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse. 
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse
There's been a lot written in the press about the form that advertising on YouTube is going to take over time. I was wondering if you could just talk us through what your vision is for how that is going to develop? 
Eric Schmidt
 As I indicated in my earlier question and answer, we are going to experiment with a number of such approaches. There are a couple of things that we now know. We know the people who use YouTube are very fanatical about it. In particular, if they're looking at content which is copyrighted or related to a copyrighted character, we know that that person is somebody who the copyright owner is trying to reach. So the first thing that we can do is we can connect the copyright owner with the end user. 
We can also do advertising ad we can do advertising both as pre-roll, post-roll, but we can also do something else: we can do contextual advertising around the content in various ways. So these are all combinations that we're experimenting with. We are encouraging copyright owners to submit content to us and then to measure how many fans, how many tremendous viewers, what that community is… that's a very, very qualified viewer. 
We believe ultimately, we will develop partnerships in advertising along the lines that Omid suggested, many of which are very unusual. In addition to being the list that I just suggested, there will be all sorts of ways of linking our advertising system and the advertising system of our partners so that they can do very, very interesting things with the communities that have developed around powerful entertainment characters and content.

Your next question comes from Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Co. 
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Co.
 George, your traffic acquisition cost for the quarter was about 81% of your network revenue. That's about 300 basis points increase if you compare it to last year. I'm assuming that's the net effect of AOL, MySpace and eBay deals, among others, kicking in. Is that the new level we should expect as a base going forward? 
Second, can you help us understand the size and growth of your display ad business? Is it at 10% revenue yet? We have heard pretty positive feedback on it lately, particularly on the placement targeting function. So just if we can get a couple comments there. 
Eric Schmidt
 I think Omid is probably better equipped to answer the one question. I'm sorry, what was your first question? Hello? 
Operator
One moment. 
Youssef Squali - Jefferies & Co.
Can you hear me now? Sorry about that. 
Eric Schmidt
We have seen TAC increase a bit, and it's all a function of the types of deals that we are doing. And there's nothing nefarious about it. It's just a trend in our business. 
 Omid Kordestani
 On the breakout, we don't really have any official breakouts from Google directly. According to a third party taking measurements on this, there's over 25% of the top 100 advertisers are now consistently running display and video ads with Google and these are some of the advantages I mentioned, just a variety of formats, the access to the way they can target different content channels to reach their audience, both domestically and globally. 
Really, advertisers are experimenting with this and more and more, we are in the regular CMO meetings across the world, led by the U.S. efforts and now being replicated across the world. So I'm very pleased with this performance, and we're putting a lot of resources behind it to basically be present in front of these customers and in all of our field operations across the globe. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers 
You mentioned a number of drivers of monetization during the quarter, but unless I missed it, I don't think you talked about personalization. I think that is an area you started to experiment with more during the quarter. So could you talk about what you are seeing in terms of the early returns with personalizing search, and then how you view ranking there as a monetization driver going forward? Can you also give us a rough sense of what percentage of your users actually sign in when searching? 
 Larry Page
 We're very excited about personalization. Actually, in my comments, I mentioned personalized homepages and so on and use of gadgets there, which we have been really excited about our growth in those areas and the usage of those products and how excited users are about them. 
I think we have a ways to go in really promoting those features. We're starting to really get very healthy usage. But it's not that obvious to me when I go to Google how to get to those things, and so I think we've got a lot more growth in store. Also the quality improvements we get with personalized search are also quite significant, and we're very excited about that, and then that driving more search and more monetization and so on. So I think overall, I think we're very excited about personalization. We've had a lot of significant traction in terms of users and we have a lot more opportunity in terms of promoting that very useful functionality to our huge base of users.

Your next question comes from Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets. 
 Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets
 The third-party data suggests that the paid click international market is growing significantly faster than the U.S. So I was curious how big is that gap for you, international/U.S., in terms of the paid clicks? Is that a gap that has been widening in recent quarters? 
Eric Schmidt
You are referring to growth rate of advertising revenue, international versus U.S.? 
 Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets
No, not the revenues, but the clicks themselves. 
 Jonathan Rosenberg
 Specifically the question is, what percentage have the clicks grown disproportionately outside the U.S.? I'm not sure I can give you the percentage there. 
 Paul Keung - CIBC World Markets
 Just some color would be good. Relatively, how significant is the difference? 
 Jonathan Rosenberg
 I'm not sure how much color I can give you. There's no question that we're doing very well from a market share perspective internationally. We're doing even better internationally than we are doing domestically, where we are doing very, very well. The relative growth rates are bigger internationally in the emerging markets where the ad systems are launched. 
Eric Schmidt
 It's actually a series of compounding. The Internet is growing faster outside the United States than in the U.S. Our advertising systems are growing faster outside the United States than in the U.S. and the monetization improvements from a low base is growing faster outside the U.S. than in the U.S. Having said that, our advertising and user traffic growth are growing very well in the United States. So it's hard to know how big a gap. They are all doing well, international better than the U.S., for a multiplicity of factors.

Your final question comes from Mark May - Needham & Co. 
Mark May - Needham & Co. 
Thanks for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you discuss your efforts to build an ad platform that serves all types of advertisers. You mentioned radio or audio, print and video, which most people assume you're talking about YouTube and/or Google Video. TV advertising was not specifically listed. The question is, do you see the traditional TV ad market as one that you would like to serve? If so, is the opportunity in TV advertising part of your current efforts at YouTube and Google Video? Or might TV be an opportunity that is somewhat different than what you're currently developing or pursuing at those two units? 
Eric Schmidt
 Thank you for that final question. We have already said that we are experimenting with traditional television advertising. It is fair to say that whatever we do will be new and different from the way it is currently sold and marketed. So you should think of us as experimenting, using our targeting technology and our tremendous reach to see if we can improve what is already a good and robust business that others are in. 
With respect to television/radio/video advertising, there are many reasons to believe that the targeting technology that we have invented can really apply well, that people will pay, advertisers in particular, will pay much higher rates for ads that are targeted than ones that are untargeted. So for example, set-top boxes can help you target to end users and the set-top boxes are now IP addressable. So there's a lot of evidence that as we link our systems into the systems of people who are operators, we can get another leg up on targeting and ultimately provide both a more useful advertising experience for the end user and also a better advertising experience for the advertiser themselves in terms of conversion. 
So with that, Kim, it sounds like we should wrap up. I wanted to thank everybody again. We are very, very pleased with what is going on at Google. The systems that we have talked about, the approach that we're taking, the investment that we are taking both in terms of people as well as capital, the globalization of the business, the expansion of the business into advertising, into radio and television as was just asked, the expansion into new platforms such as mobile… the sum of those are very, very exciting and we believe will be very impactful for the company going forward. 
 Kim Jabal
 I think that’s it. Thank you.

Eric Schmidt
Well, thank you very much, Kim, and thanks to all of you for spending your afternoon or evening with us. Business is very, very good here at Google, and we had an excellent quarter in all respects, especially including international. 
Five things came together again when I look at our quarter. We have strong user growth with improvements in search, search quality, larger information indices, all the things that end users care about. We had much better ads quality and improved advertising products across the many advertisers we serve. The diversity of our business, its international component, the multi-market component, the combination of what users, advertisers and publishers want; that diversity served us very well. Of course, the blizzard of new product launches, on precedent for our scale and confusing to almost everyone, seems to create new opportunities for us every day. 
Partnerships, something we talked about last quarter. Each one defining a new and important market for us; it started, of course, with the Dell deal in Q2, where we got better access for end users to Google, followed by the Adobe deal, better integration of high-quality graphics in Google. Followed then by eBay, integration with Skype and bringing international advertisers into the fold. Intuit, advertising services to medium and small businesses that we couldn't otherwise reach or could not serve as well. MTV Networks, video distribution and video ad targeting and syndication, bringing in a whole new way in which we can make money for content video publishers. Fox MySpace, a search and advertising partner with us for the fastest-growing social network. And of course, culminating last week with the YouTube acquisition, sort of the ultimate partnership, if you will, recognizing the fundamental importance of video of all types. 
The sum of these five things: users, ads, the diversity of our business, the blizzard of new product launches, and the partnership strategy which is in full force, has delivered great, great results and we're very, very pleased with them. 
George, maybe you could take us through the details and all the questions people ask. 
George Reyes
Sure. Good afternoon, everybody and thanks, Eric. I will be brief today, as I'd like to really get into the details of our quarter. Gross revenue the quarter was $2.7 billion, reflecting growth of 70% over Q3 of last year. Google.com revenue was $1.6 billion, representing an increasing percentage of our total revenue at 60% and growth of 84% year-over-year. 
As we have previously discussed, Q2 and Q3 are typically seasonal quarters for us, with somewhat weaker traffic growth offset by higher monetization. This year, the seasonal trend was slightly dampened in Q3 with stronger than anticipated traffic on Google.com. As with previous years, however, monetization gains were the primary driver of sequential revenue growth. 
In our AdSense businesses, where we experienced a more typical seasonal growth trend, revenue growth was driven primarily by monetization gains and search and traffic gains and content, and by the addition of new partners across the board, particularly internationally. 
Revenue from the U.S. was $1.5 billion, driven by higher than expected traffic growth and continued monetization gains. International growth was very strong in Q3 as well. Our largest European markets, the UK and Germany, performed very well, as did many other countries throughout the world, including the Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy, Canada, and Australia. While still a small percentage of our overall revenues, many of our emerging markets, most notably India and Brazil, are growing at very high rates as well. 
We do expect historic seasonal trends in Q4 to continue, where the growth in the U.S. has typically been greater than internationally. This is largely attributable to more pronounced effects of the holiday season in the U.S. 
Turning to traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, they were $825 million. The majority of TAC expenses is related to the amounts ultimately paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled $780 million in the quarter. TAC also consists of amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners, which totaled $45 million in the third quarter. We expect that in the future, substantially all fees related to distribution partnerships will be recognized as TAC, as we are better able to estimate the useful life of access points and better able to match costs to revenues earned. 
Turning to operating expenses, operating expenses included $98 million in stock-based compensation and totaled $710 million. These expenses included $382 million in payroll-related and facilities expense and $50 million in advertising and promotional expenses, which includes $14 million related to certain distribution deals. We expect operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to hire aggressively and invest in marketing programs. 
Non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock-based compensation, grew to over $1 billion with non-GAAP operating margins of 38%, up slightly from Q2. However, as we have previously discussed, margins may decline as we continue to hire aggressively and make significant investments in the business. 
In Q3, CapEx totaled $492 million, the majority of which was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers, and networking equipment. As usual, we carefully and prudently evaluate capital expenditures and believe that the long-term benefits justify these upfront investments. As we have noted previously, CapEx growth would be substantially greater than the annual rate of revenue growth in 2006, and we continue to anticipate this going into Q4. 
Now turning to cash, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations at $1 billion. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, which we define as cash flow from operations, less CapEx, increased to $512 million. Our effective tax rate was 29% for the third quarter. We currently anticipate that our effective tax rate for the full year will be at or below 30%. 
Our headcount at September 30 was 9,378 employees, an increase of 1,436 employees over Q2 levels. We expect to continue to hire aggressively around the world in Q4 across all functions. 
In closing, we are delighted to report a very strong quarter with very healthy growth across the board. Now I will turn it over to Larry for more comments on our accomplishments in the quarter. 
Sergey Brin
This is Sergey here, we just juggled things with Larry. Sorry to surprise you. Anyhow, we have been working hard to improve our search experience over the past quarter, as we do all quarters and in this past quarter, I am proud to say we have made them significantly fresher and more comprehensive. This has been a combination of both core infrastructure work as well as some of the visible features that you can see. 
With Webmaster Central, webmasters can submit information to us about their site. They can tell us when things get updated. They get information back from us about some of our crawling patterns and so forth. The upshot is that this improves their sites as well as our coverage, a great win-win. 
On the subject of coverage, there has been a really significant change on Google News, where now you can search not just the current news, but archives going back 200 years. I encourage you to give it a try. You can see lots of fantastic historical times, as reported by the news right there and then. 
When I perform a search, I often find that the best answer is not necessarily a web page. I know that sounds like heresy from Google, but in fact, if you are learning a sport, if you want to build a house, if you want to study a science, often videos are the best medium to learn about those things, to learn how to do those things. This has obviously been a significant initiative for us. 
I am speaking about both Google Video, which we have developed over the past few quarters or so, as well as obviously you have heard about YouTube, which we announced our intent to acquire. Both of those together are going to really help get more video to more users and providing them with better information to large classes of their kinds of search queries. 
Over the past quarter, we also have worked to better integrate our products together and we want to make them more useful to organizations such as businesses, universities, families even. I am speaking primarily, of course, about Google Apps for Your Domain. That combines Gmail, which is the number one used portion of that, but also Google Talk and Calendar, in that they all work together on your own particular domain, whether it is a .com, .org, .edu. That's gotten great uptake, and people are really happy about it. 
Now it is also going to soon include a couple more products, which the two of them have together been integrated now, and I'm talking about docs and spreadsheets. These are apps that allow users to create, store, share and publish both documents as well as spreadsheets online. We have been using these in-house internally for a while ourselves, and we have been really using them a lot. It is pretty amazing. If you are sitting there, you're either reading or even editing a document and you can see as your colleagues edit them right before your eyes simultaneously. It is really a powerful feature, and it is really an easy way to collaborate. 
Anyhow, these are just a few highlights of what we've done over the past quarter. And for some more highlights, let me turn it over to Larry. 
Larry Page
Thank you, Sergey. Well, I am very excited about our results this quarter too, and I would like to talk to you briefly about our advertising base, both its breadth and depth and growth. Google's business strengths really lies in the breadth of our advertiser base. We arguably have the greatest diversity of advertisers of any company in the world, from small to medium to large, across almost every vertical and across hundreds of countries. 
We want to be the easiest company in the world for advertisers to do business with. We are making it easier for small customers to get started, while working with larger customers to develop more complex, integrated advertising campaigns across search, display, video, and soon audio. We see tremendous opportunities for innovation here. 
This quarter, we partnered with Intuit to make AdWords Starter Edition Maps and Base easily available to Intuit's millions of QuickBooks users. We wanted to make it easier for them to advertise and find customers online, as well as make their information and products and services available on the Internet. We also launched coupons on Google Maps, and we hope it will be an appealing genre for our smaller and mid-sized advertisers. We teamed up with Valpak to provide coupons from current Valpak advertisers. 
Over half of local businesses don't have websites yet, based on the estimates we see and our local business center helps those businesses easily create a web presence so they can advertise online. 
Let me switch gears for a second and talk about larger advertisers. For those larger advertisers, we offer an integrated solution for direct response and branding. This solution provides an always-on platform that allows them to efficiently market all of their products and services, not just a select few. Google has always been about intelligent targeting, that's probably what you know about from our Search app., and putting ads in front of users when they're most interested in a certain product or service. We apply this philosophy across all of our advertising format. 
We started with our text-based ads, and then contextual ads, and now we are working on mobile local video, radio, and prints products. Our increasing penetration of the Ad Age 100 and continually growing advertiser budgets confirm that our approach here is working. 
Let me tell you a little bit about Google Checkout. We launched Google Checkout and our goal is really to improve the purchasing experience for users and deliver higher conversion rates for advertisers. We are making steady progress here with strong growth in the number of both buyers and sellers and we continue to penetrate the top 500 U.S. online retailers. 
You can now search in Froogle for Checkout-enabled merchants, and this is a feature I find really useful when I buy things online. In seconds, really anyone can purchase from a wide variety of online retailers with Google Checkout. 
Now Sergey mentioned earlier all the things we do to satisfy users and our commitment to help them extend their lives online. The economic success we continue to enjoy is the direct result of our ability to marry our user experience to the information that advertisers want to communicate. By delivering comprehensive advertising solutions for small and large advertisers and continually improving ad quality, we create a better user experience and a more effective advertising result. Together, these results have really led to the outstanding results that we are extremely happy to report this quarter. 
And now, I will pass it back to Eric. 
Eric Schmidt
Thanks very much, Larry. A couple of final points to make. We are very much in the search business. We understand and we believe that people’s information and the information they want to receive will be consistent and needs to be accessible when and where they want it for them, in a very personalized way. That information will deliver them across many different devices, in any way they want to consume it. The content or information will always be the same, consistent for the user or the person. 
The interesting thing is that this approach to having your information personalized is a benefit not only for the user who can continue to refine and target information, which is what we are working on, to people in a very personalized way; but also for businesses who want to know they are spending their money in an effective and targeted way. 
We also believe at Google that we are more effective when we partner. Partnerships are a huge benefit, not just for Google but also for whoever the partner is, as we highlighted earlier. We see impressive growth in the area of partnering with existing and new companies from content technology and advertising perspectives; we’ve laid the groundwork for many more coming. This industry is clearly poised for growth, and this is still the early stages of something which is likely to be a very major transformational industry. 
As we continue to innovate and bring out these new products, we'll also continue to take our feedback from end users and customers and improve the experiences, bringing the most personalized and targeted information to people, which is ultimately our mission. These new partnerships and as we explore these new ways of working, our learning and feedback from users and customers continue, this allows us to constantly and consistently innovate and to improve organizing the world's information. 
Sharing that innovation and expertise with our users and customers will continue to provide access to the world's information while we organize it in a very personalized and targeted way. That benefit drives the entire cycle of Google, and it's fundamental. 
With that, let's add Omid Kordestani, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Business Operations and Sales; and Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, Products. 
Kim Jabal
Operator, could we go to questions, please? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup. 
 Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
Great, thank you very much. Eric, at the beginning, you talked about the blizzard of new launches, product launches and you mentioned some of the confusion around that. Can you just talk about whether you need to realign or if you are trying to realign the product strategy somewhat in order to whittle down some of that confusion? 
A really quick cash question: can you use cash in the future to make acquisitions? You are using your stock for the YouTube deal. Clearly, the stock seems to be undervalued. Wouldn't it be more ideal if you could give cash for those deals? Thank you. 
Eric Schmidt
On the cash side, I will have George discuss that as a strategy. From the standpoint of products, our innovation engine is producing products at a rate that I have never seen before. We run under the 70/20/10 principle that we have talked about for a long time. Sergey has been leading an initiative which he calls features, not products. Sergey, maybe you want to talk a little bit about that? 
Sergey Brin
Yes, exactly. What we are concerned about is that if we continue to develop so many new individual products that are all their assorted silos, you will have to essentially search for our products before you can even use them. And then you will have to search before you can do a search, in many cases. 
Instead what we're doing now is we are trying to create the horizontal functionality across a range of products, across media types and so forth. For example, I mentioned already Google Apps for Your Domain, and that in a sense is a product, but really it just combines a whole bunch of other offerings together, seamlessly integrated together so they can work well for an organization. 
Another example which we haven't gotten quite up and running yet, but when you want to share your documents or your pictures or your videos, it would be nice to have the exact same way to share all those things, to have all that functionality available across all of those media types in the identical way, rather than developing sort of one-offs for each of those products. 
There's a whole set of initiatives that's now going on in the Company to make our product offerings simpler and more consistent for all of our users. 
Finally, let me just touch on search. You may have noticed more and more now when you do search you will see, for example, images and news stories and products across the top that you can click to. There are increasingly many ways that we are integrating together all of our search offerings so you don't have to pick where you're going to search first. But we are going to give you the best possible information from all of our corpora. 
George Reyes
Mark, with respect to the stock transaction, I think you should think of this as a one-off, one-time that we did. And going forward we're going to use cash. 
 Mark Mahaney – Citigroup
Thank you very much. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Robert Peck - Bear Stearns. 
Robert Peck – Bear Stearns
Hi everybody, congratulations. Two quick questions for you here. One is, Eric, could you comment a little bit on the content deal that you signed right before the YouTube deal? Any pending litigation? Did any of the content providers take stakes in either Google or YouTube as part of those deals? 
Secondly, bigger picture, back at Analyst Day you talked about $100 billion revenue goal for the Company. It's clear you probably can't get there on just advertising dollars alone. Could you maybe talk to us about what are the sources of revenue that you see developing over the coming years? Thanks. 
Eric Schmidt
With respect to the content deals and the ones we did most recently, speaking for Google, we were able to do some very interesting deals using a combination of financial prepayments, revenue shares, other ways in which the money flows. We saw that in our partnerships the best partnerships come when both partners have a share in the revenue success of the deal and that is typically the deal structure we have been doing. I'd rather not go into the specifics of those deals. 
With respect to the YouTube part, as you know, we've entered into an agreement to purchase YouTube, but we are not actually closed with them, so they are still today a separate company. We did, as part of the due diligence of YouTube, go through all of their details under the normal due diligence and we were satisfied with what we saw. 
With respect to your second question about the $100 billion, I actually left the question of $100 billion as an ambiguous question in my comments in the spring. But nevertheless, it is important that we develop other good sources of revenue going forward. We think that advertising and in particular, search advertising, will be the majority of our advertising revenue for many, many years. We have a number of very interesting successes; the enterprise business continues to churn along. It would be an enormous success on its own merits. 
I think if you look at, for example, Google Apps for Your Domain, you can see that product as it becomes more successful could become, for example, a very significant source of revenue. In addition to that, the Checkout by Google product offers a tremendous revenue potential as well. Of course it is in the early stages. 
Do we have the next question? 
Operator
Your next question comes from Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley. 
 Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley 
Thanks. We had a question, just to drill down a little bit on some of the video deals. The traditional content providers to-date have been somewhat hesitant to really figure out how to monetize their video content on the Internet. It feels like the deal and the deals that you struck around with YouTube and around the YouTube day, were things that will prove with a little bit of hindsight to be things that have really moved the monetization ball forward. 
So the question there is how critical were some of the deals that you talked about, number one, that you just alluded to in the last question? Two, do you feel that we are going to start to see real progress in monetization of video over the next six months, in large part because of what you have done? 
A third question relates to, do you think we will see any changes in traffic acquisition costs as a percent of revenue related to your video efforts? Thanks. 
Omid Kordestani
Hi Mary, this is Omid Kordestani. So in regard to your questions -- 
 Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley 
You are the only one who could remember all the questions? 
Omid Kordestani
I am going to do my best, and then you can remind me if I didn't cover them. So first of all, I think we are very excited to see that not only Google has had a great momentum in talking to all the content partnerships; in fact, the majority of the executive team has been busy meeting with as many companies as possible and would like to touch many of them in the coming weeks and are actively talking about ways that we can bring a lot of revenue and search capability, and basically all the Google capabilities that can improve the way these products can be offered to users and generate a lot of revenue for the content owners. 
We also were very pleased that we saw that same philosophy at YouTube, that they were very actively striking these relationships. They are complex, it is a new space. We are all trying to understand each other. We think ultimately the answer lies with the fact that there is a lot of usage here, a lot of interest from our users, and that we believe that there is also a great monetization engine that Google can provide here to make this all work for all the parties. 
The other thing I would like to say is that we are having a great success with the video ads format. A lot of this actually has been led by our U.S. advertising sales organization and our great products, which Jonathan can address in a few minutes. There are lots of examples from our work with Goodby, Silverstein and Saturn to even the tail of this. We are finding advertisers that are finding the video format very complementary. It is user-initiated action, which very much means that the user is interested in seeing these ads and creates great response rates. 
So ultimately we really believe that there's a lot of momentum here, there's a lot of learning here and that there's a lot of revenue here for everyone to share. Jonathan can add a few points. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I think there's been a lot of success, if you look at just some of the early stages in the last quarter. In Q3, we launched the video ads product globally, and they were implemented by hundreds of advertisers, I think in over 30 countries. Office Max, Paramount, GM, Nike, Renault, British Airways; Omid mentioned Saturn. We are having success in a number of areas. 
For starters, just in terms of getting reach, a good example is what Paramount Classics did with 'An Inconvenient Truth', where they used site targeting to select a bunch of environmentally-focused sites that they knew would reach the right demographic. They actually did exit polls that showed that 30% of the people who saw that movie on the opening weekend were exposed to their ad. 
There's also a number of other examples, the Silverstein campaign that Omid mentioned with Saturn -- which I think was for Aura, which is the mid-size sedan -- is doing all sorts of great different kinds of targeting. They have a campaign there where they ran it in six markets and users in Raleigh, North Carolina would get a Google Earth powered view of the world that would zoom down into the Saturn dealership. So there's all sorts of examples there. 
One last example that I would give you is there are products for small advertisers as well. This product isn't just for large advertisers. There are products like a String Master robotic guitar, if you look at some of the guitar tuning sites. It's the kind of thing that you would never understand it if you saw a text ad that said amazing guitar tuner. But when you actually see this thing and its little video work, you really understand the value. They are having a great deal of success. 
 Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley 
Thanks. George, any thoughts on TAC? 
George Reyes
So TAC is actually moving in the right direction for us. I think if you have had a chance to look at the slides that we have put up, Mary, you will see that. 
 Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley 
Well, the question related to TAC and video in the future. 
George Reyes
Way too early to go there, Mary. 
Eric Schmidt
Let's go to our next question. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs. 
 Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could comment, on the Analyst Day you talked about revenue per search being very difficult different domestically than internationally. I think the exact quote was 60% of your queries came international, but 40% of your revenue. How has that mix changed over time, just so we kind of assess the opportunity? 
A second question, display advertising and video, what percent of the queries that are done on the site today, broadly, would be appropriate for a video response? Is there a way to assess that? When do you think that your percentage of revenue for display advertising could reach 10%? Is that a couple years away? Is that a year away? Five years away? Just a broad picture. Thanks. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Well I guess I could start with the display versus video in terms of percentage. I think that that dynamic is really going to be a function of the breadth of the inventory getting built out, and the experiments that people are doing today where we are seeing when these type of video efforts work. 
I think they have to be one of the kind of models that I was describing earlier. So something that is explanatory in value like the guitar, where you really understand the value of it when you actually see it. Or with other examples of the kind of branded type efforts that studios want to do when they are trying to build critical mass for different movies. 
So I think it could get to something like 10%, but we're basically going to have to make it much, much easier to create the videos, submit them and then figure out in the context of a bunch of these sites within the network where they will actually work. I think we are only just beginning to understand that. 
On the domestic versus international question, it is the case that there's some international markets that are very, very strong, particularly some of the Western European markets. I'm not sure specifically what kind of color I can give you beyond that other than to reinforce what George said, which is in Western Europe, particularly in the UK, Germany, Italy, many of those countries, we are doing extremely well. 
 Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Great, thank you. 
Omid Kordestani
The only other thing I would like to add is that in terms of overall success, we are going to see that here is first we have the very powerful Google network, made up of both search sites and content sites. And then we are doing partnerships like the MySpace partnership with Fox and News Corp., where significant amounts of inventory and growth opportunity represent ways for us to try new ad formats. So we are going to basically try everything from our traditional text ads here to the display advertising and we see a lot of potential here. 
Eric Schmidt
Let's go to our next question, thanks. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Imran Khan - JP Morgan. 
 Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Yes, hi. Thank you very much. Two questions. Eric, you talked about partnership. I think in the past, portal players made some great partnership with telco guys. Now with your Fusion product and your partnership with AOL, do you think that you see some opportunity to do some partnership with the telco side on the broadband deals? 
Secondly, going back to the international side, George, could you give us some sense of what percentage of the revenue came from UK? Give us some color in terms of breadth of advertisers in the France, Spain and Italy market. If I look at Germany, France, Spain, and Italy, it's like 2.5 times bigger than UK, but I think less than 10% of your revenue each of those countries represent. So can you give us some color? What do you think in terms of advertisers take rate? Thank you. 
Eric Schmidt
Clearly, the UK is a very, very strong market for us. We have very substantial market share there and it is a very healthy business. What was your second question that was tied to that? 
 Imran Khan - JP Morgan
The question was what percentage of revenue came from UK? 
Eric Schmidt
Roughly 16% or 15% to 16%, something like that. 
 Imran Khan - JP Morgan
The follow-up question related to UK was, if I look at Germany, France, Spain, and Italy and combined those four countries are 2.5 times bigger than UK, but none of those countries are not more than 10% of your revenue countries. So I was wondering, are you seeing any resentment from advertisers that they're not taking the search advertisement? Or what is the reason that you're not seeing a big take rate? You know, commerce is going very strongly in those countries. 
Eric Schmidt
Omid is going to take that one. 
Omid Kordestani
Hi. We are actually having great success in Europe in all of those countries. What is really happening is there are just local dynamics that are very different. As an example, traditionally in some of these markets we realize that the websites of, for example, financial institutions were more information-oriented than transaction-oriented. Whereas in the U.S. you can complete a loan transaction or a credit card transaction right away, instantly. 
So we have taken a lot of care and time to basically move advertisers that are capable of using our systems to our online channel, as well as then having our sales force on the ground in the field, really spent a lot of time working directly with major companies in each of these reasons regions. We are actually very, very optimistic about the results we are seeing and the growth we're seeing in Germany, France and Italy, as well as the emerging markets. 
Across the board, we are seeing, off a very small base, but significant growth rates that are actually ahead of U.S. and Europe in some of the emerging markets. Again, they are small bases and we think though that they have the potential as we get the core search products and advertising products working well there, and the future of the newer monetization products extending to these markets. 
Eric, do you want to answer that too? 
Eric Schmidt
No, that's fine. Go ahead. Let's go to our next question. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel. 
 Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel 
Just a couple of questions on video and YouTube. First, how heavily are you relying on maybe a liberal interpretation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act? I guess, how are you going to be responding to some of the copyright commentary out there? 
And then I know you don't give guidance, but just a binary response is fine. Will YouTube be profitable or not profitable as you see it? I'll stop there. Thanks. 
Eric Schmidt
The second question is easily answered; we don't give guidance. The first question is, we are definitely not relying on a liberal or a conservative interpretation of the DMCA. We are relying on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act as it is being imposed by law and there are not a lot of shades of gray in how it works. There's a set of procedures for take down. If you operate under this, companies have a Safe Harbor. We do our very, very best to implement it exactly as prescribed, as does everyone else in the industry. So whether people like it or not, it is the law of the land and we absolutely operate by it. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Jordan Rohan - RBC Capital Markets. 
 Jordan Rohan - RBC Capital Markets
I was curious about two things related to video and YouTube. The first is on the CapEx side, have you already started to ramp your CapEx in anticipation of adding a major, major source of video streaming and, therefore, necessary capacity to your system in YouTube? 
Second, if not, can you talk about the demands that you might see or the incremental CapEx that you might see as the web shifts from a largely text-based web to a largely video-based web over some period of time? 
 Larry Page
Thanks, Jordan. This is Larry. I think we are very lucky at Google to have a huge amount of computer resources, which you have seen reflected. It turns out search is a pretty hard problem. So we've had a lot of resources both planned and underway to deal with that. 
Video is actually mostly, I think, more of a bandwidth-intensive application. We have already had a lot of success also on our own sites with Google Video and some experience in building that up. I don't think that we think that will be hugely material to our capital spending versus all the other things that we are doing. 
 Jordan Rohan - RBC Capital Markets
Thank you very much. 
Eric Schmidt
This is Eric. Let me just add, we are the beneficiaries of huge economies of scale around Moore's Law, our capital spending. We apply those across the entire breadth of our products. It works very well for us. Let's go ahead to our next question. 
 Operator
Your next question comes from Ben Schachter - UBS. 
 Ben Schachter - UBS 
Congratulations on a fantastic quarter. Could you define how you determine what revenue is Google.com revenue, particularly as it relates to revenue paid for through TAC or distribution partners, as well as AdSense for domains? 
Secondly, the AdWords Starter Edition, I was wondering if you could talk about how that is performing, particularly for local businesses? 
And then for George, will TAC related to distribution partners increase at about the same pace as Google.com revenue? 
And then finally an update just on the investment income and some of the issues you have been working through with the SEC on where you can invest that? Thanks. 
Eric Schmidt
Jonathan, do you want to start the first part of the questions and George can handle the second ones? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
So basically the AdWords Starter Edition is an alternative version of AdWords, and it's a lot easier for novices to get into search advertising. It's got a much simpler UI. I'm not sure in terms of color how much I can offer you. We have been using it extensively. We have been tracking the percentage of advertisers who start with AdWords Starter Edition who then actually are successful in getting their work to manifest itself in the form of a working campaign; and who then continue to opt into our ad systems. 
We are doing much, much better there on a percentage basis in terms of getting the advertiser signed up. So in that sense, it has been successful. We are also then getting a number of those advertisers using AdWords itself. So the take rates are strong. 
 Ben Schachter - UBS 
And then how you define revenue for Google.com on AdSense for Domains and TAC? 
George Reyes
The way that we think about that is we have a very thriving Google.com business and there is a negligible, very negligible portion of that Google.com business that gets rev shared. So, that fundamentally is the model we use on that. 
And then on the AdSense side, as you know, the rev shares are substantially larger as we split our rev shares with our network partners. Is that what you were getting at, Ben? 
 Ben Schachter - UBS 
I'm looking at AdSense for Domains. I was wondering if that was counted as Google.com revenue or partner revenue? 
Eric Schmidt
It is partner revenue. Let's go to our next question. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Bill Morrison - JMP Securities. 
 Bill Morrison - JMP Securities
A couple of questions. One, just on the CapEx. George, you are pretty clear that this year CapEx has grown faster than revenue. I was wondering if you could just maybe frame next year or the next few years, is that something we should continue to expect beyond 2006? 
On MySpace, I was curious, you have obviously announced the deal and talked a lot about it. Curious if you have actually signed the deal, and their response to your planned acquisition of YouTube? 
Eric Schmidt
First, we made a decision strategically to invest capital. Part of the reason that our results have been so strong in the last year is because a year or two years ago, we “overinvested” in capital. In our model, the capital investment we are making gives us differentially better service quality, better scale, better leverage and we intend to continue that. George? 
George Reyes
Besides that, Ben, I am sitting here looking at the free cash flow for this quarter alone. It is $512 million. So the CapEx investments that we need to make we can easily afford and drive them to build more value for the Company. 
Eric Schmidt
With respect to your question on MySpace, we signed a binding letter of agreement which we are operating under. We will come to final contract terms, I think, very quickly on that. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch. 
 Justin Post - Merrill Lynch 
Thanks. The U.S. growth, I think, was 57% in the quarter, and I think you said in your prepared remarks that monetization was faster than traffic growth. Is that safe to assume that if you had to break that down, monetization was a bigger percent, more than half of the growth there? Were there other traffic areas of the Google websites that helped drive some revenue growth that were kind of interesting in the quarter? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
George may be able to speak to some of the specific revenue issues. Just in terms of the monetization and traffic dynamic, this is seasonally, from a traffic perspective, usually a less robust quarter. From a monetization standpoint, I think what was different this quarter relative to previous quarters when you look at the seasonality is that in both Q3 of '04 and '05 we talked about a lot of monetization improvements that occurred intra quarter. Those then manifested themselves in forms of a very strong Q3 from a monetization perspective. 
The story this quarter is a little different in that we did a lot of monetization improvements in Q2. So RPN was impacted positively by those improvements at the beginning of the quarter carrying over from Q2. So there were actually relatively fewer monetization improvements this Q3 than there were in previous Q3s, but we started the quarter with very strong RPN that continued all the way through the quarter as a function of the improvements that were done in Q2. 
Other than that, in terms of the questions about other properties, many of the other properties are experiencing strong traffic, news, images and much of that comes back to Google.com. 
Eric Schmidt

Your next question comes from Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray. 
 Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray 
Good afternoon, thank you and congratulations. 
Eric Schmidt
Thanks, Safa. 
 Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray 
My question is really about the components of your operation that help you grow about 84% according to my calculation, on Google sites. I want to focus on Google sites because you have control. 
Eric, you outlined the five features or five characteristics that have been helping you grow. But we have been lumping all of these as search revenues. Is it fair to say that 84% growth didn't really come from what we would traditionally consider search revenues? Your competitors are reporting anywhere between a mid-teens growth. So there is a huge discrepancy here. I wonder if you can help us understand where this growth is coming from beyond the traditional search clicks? 
Eric Schmidt
Well in fact, the vast majority of our revenue is from search and search revenues, advertising revenues, so indeed it is that. So Omid, maybe you can take us through that. 
Omid Kordestani
Hi, Safa. I think it is going back to something that Jonathan mentioned, is that some of the product improvements that we're making and just really the incredible innovation by the products and engineering team. And then our sales folks are really feeding the system and have a cascading impact, which is these improvements that are made over the quarters build on each other. 
The other thing that is really driving this is a number of factors: the geographic expansion of our products and our advertiser base and our user base across the globe; again, domestic growth we are experiencing in users and number of advertisers. Better search quality improvements we're making there, again, and the way the targeting of ads go hand-in-hand with that really help ultimately improve the response rates on these ads. More inventory from the different properties, again a lot of the network is built off great search inventory and renewal of those partnerships continue to fuel the growth. 
We're also seeing growth in advertiser spend . There's more of the flow from offline to online happening. We are introducing the new ad formats and offering new ways for these advertisers to work with us. So it is really a cascading effect of how these product improvements build on each other and then the natural growth rates we are experiencing throughout from the geographic expansion and the products I mentioned. 
 Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray 
Do you feel that you are gaining any market share, either in U.S. or internationally? And has it contributed to this growth at all? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Market share appears to be strong. We saw some discussion in terms of the summer slowdown where we are, I think, a little disproportionately impacted by having a high share of academics. But as I think many of you had noted, that recovered very quickly and is strong across the world. 
Eric Schmidt
Let’s go to our next question.

Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers. 
 Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers 
Thank you. It looks like your network grew about 4% sequentially. Can you talk a little bit about to what degree you might be cleaning up the network? If you are, how far along you are in that process and what kind of affiliate partners might be coming out? Thank you. 
Larry Page
I think we've always had a very strong stance with regards to maintaining the quality of our network, especially as compared to the other companies in the space. We've had very tough policies about monetization and things like spyware and adware and all these kinds of things that people do, kind of on the margin. I have actually been very happy with the quality we have in our ad network and also we released some improvements just very recently of landing page quality, even for all ads really which push for higher quality advertisements. So I think we have been really innovating in that space and we will continue to do that. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Rowen - Prudential. 
 Mark Rowen – Prudential
Thanks. Eric and Jonathan, back at Analyst Day you talked about monetization gains and you said that there was lots of room to increase monetization for a long time to come. But it seems that as you get better and better in the search business and providing search results to people, that every quarter it's going to get a little bit harder to top what you did and that the growth from monetization is going to start to slow. 
Can you just give us a sense of, do you think that most of the low-hanging fruit has been picked and it gets harder and harder from this point? Or do you still see lots of opportunities the same as what you did back at Analyst Day? 
Second, can you give us an update on local? Back at Analyst Day, you were very excited about that. I was wondering if you could just help us understand where you are at product-wise on that and on the monetization front. Thanks. 
Sergey Brin
I want to talk a little bit about monetization. In a sense, you might imagine that the low-hanging fruit have been picked. But in fact, we have at the same time built ladders and are reaching for perhaps even larger, higher-hanging fruit. 
Because we have reached a certain kind of scale, the tools and resources we have at our disposal now to really do an even better job of bringing the right advertisements to the right users at the right time is far greater. There are new kinds of things that we couldn't have even contemplated doing in the past. 
When we look at the question, for example, of video advertising you know, imagining, as Jonathan said, video advertisement as an informative ad, not talking about as even a branding or entertainment kind of ad, but you can imagine a local advertiser having a video advertisement for their local bakery, showing you how they bake the things, and showing you around the store and whatnot. 
I think there are just many new opportunities that we have, given the evolution of both our ability to analyze advertising very well, the traffic and user base that we have, the huge advertiser base. You know, we can choose among far more advertisements these days and we can get them to adopt new technologies. 
I think all of those things are really coming together and we seem to be able to produce new ways to monetize all the time. So I don't see an obvious ceiling; obviously, nobody can 100% predict the future. 
Larry Page
I was just gong to add to Sergey's excellent comments, that even if you do searches now just on normal web search, and you look for things, you click on the ads for things to buy on the searches you do, I find very often the ads, some of the ads are good, some of them aren't. We have a huge ways to go just on the basic things that we do to making it really relevant 100% of the time, and giving you all the right advertisers that are available in that space. There's very obvious growth there still. 
Checkout also, making the process of buying things really seamless and fast and usually people buy a lot more things online. So I see very huge advances possible there even in the very basic things we do, and I'm also very excited about the new types of formats and new types of things that we can do in advertising. 
Eric Schmidt
Jonathan, do you want to answer that local question as well? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure. I think Larry and Sergey did a great job of answering the first question, which I did talk about at Analyst Day. I completely agree with them. 
On the local side, I think we have seen very strong organic growth in local searches. A lot of this is particularly fueled by Maps usage and the growth in the Maps' API and Google Earth downloads. I think there is a very, very strong ecosystem that has developed there around our API. 
When you think about that, Larry mentioned in his prepared remarks, I think, that 50% of small businesses believe they can use the Internet for their marketing and sales, but 50% of them don't have websites. So the real big win there I think may come from some of the work that we're doing with Intuit with the QuickBooks 2007 integration. That will make it very, very easy for businesses to host pages, create them, set up a site, and then generate ads. 
But if you want to check some out, type polo store, New York City. You can also a look at some of the printable coupons that Larry mentioned if you type in “carwashes in Mountainview”. 
 Mark Rowen – Prudential
And how are some of the monetization efforts in local going? I know you were doing some testing with some retailers, putting their names in the bullets on the Maps and things. Can you talk about that at all? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
It is a real portion of our revenue. I can't give you specifics in terms of percentages, but it is one of the things that we are tracking very, very carefully and that is reasonably significant at this point. 
Eric Schmidt
Let's have our last question. 
Operator
Your final question comes from Marianne Wolk - Susquehanna. 
 Marianne Wolk - Susquehanna 
Thanks. You signed a lot of distribution deals with Adobe, Dell and others. Can you let us know whether that has become a significant contributor to Google.com revenue yet? Would you say that's 5% of the Google.com revenue? 2%? Is there any way to characterize that? And thus far, can you talk about the monetization trends from that source? How do they compare with what you generate from traditional search portals? 
Eric Schmidt
Each of the deals that I highlighted is at the beginning stages. Each of them amplifies the revenue production, if you will, of our advertising network. They deepen it, they bring in more advertisers, increase the coverage. So the economics compound quarter-over-quarter as they begin to flow. The Dell deal, for example, is already shipping and doing well for us, et cetera. 
So it is hard to characterize a particular percentage, but understand that the partnerships are much more than just revenue partnerships. They really are a way of doing business for us going forward. For example, there are a lot of folks on the call asked questions about legal concerns over video. But the strategy with video was to partner, not to focus on the legal aspects, but to focus on the business partnership aspects. Because the folks who, we certainly want to respect everybody's copyrights, and they need us, we need them. The combination should produce some very interesting new partnerships, which we are hopefully going to work on, especially after the integration with YouTube is complete. 
What I wanted to do is to finish by saying that we are in many ways crossing into another era here of what it will be possible to do with the Internet. We have gone from web search, various other forms of applications to now literally being able to do business, life, entertainment, especially with the integration of video, on the net. This is a very, very powerful, powerful way in which many, many companies, many, many users, many, many advertisers will use. 
The diversity of our approach is one of our strengths, and we intend to keep going and to focus on both more partnerships, more great products, integrated as general features, growing the Company, investing in our capital, and we hope to continue to do very well. 
So with that, thank you very much. Thank you for spending so much time. And I do want to finish the call by saying, happy birthday to Omid. Thank you, all.

Thanks very much, Kim. We're very, very happy with having such a strong quarter in a seasonally-weak period for us. It looks like our model continues to work extremely well; our focus on innovation, the many things that we've talked about with you all in the past. So thank you very much for joining us. It's another good day, a good quarter for Google. 
When I look at why this is happening, I see the evolution of our strategy in front of us over and over again. We start with one thing, we learn, we iterate. That's the hallmark of how Google operates. 
Today we are going to talk a little bit about some of the new products which are coming at a fast and furious rate. I'd also like to emphasize the role of partnerships. In your questions and comments, let's explore a little bit how the partnerships that we're developing -- not just the ad partnerships, which have been studied for many years, AOL and those sorts of things -- but a lot of the new partnerships. You can see how we're behaving with partnerships when you see the tremendously important Dell deal, Adobe deal, and others coming. 
We're learning how to operate, learning how to build a stronger ecosystem. The strength of that ecosystem is central to our strategy, because we can't do it alone. We benefit by having the reach, impact, financials, and frankly, help from the partnerships, not just even the ones I named, but in content, in distribution and in access, all of which are announced with many, many more coming. 
So with that, perhaps the best thing to do is to turn it right over to George to hear how did the quarter go, George? 
George Reyes
Thanks, Eric. Q2 was another strong quarter in which we experienced robust revenue growth and made important investments, while continuing to grow our operating income. 
Revenue was nearly $2.5 billion, representing growth of 77% over Q2 of last year and 9% over Q1. Google.com revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase of 94% over last year and 10% sequentially. Despite expected summer seasonality, growth in both traffic and monetization contributed to our performance this quarter. 
Ongoing initiatives to improve the quality of our ads were a significant driver of increased monetization, along with continued healthy growth in our advertiser base. 
AdSense revenue grew 58% over last year and 7% sequentially. Many of our AdSense research partners showed solid gains in monetization this quarter, while the continued expansion of our publisher base and increases in overall traffic drove growth in AdSense for content. 
Revenue from the U.S. was $1.4 billion, or 58% of revenue. U.S. revenue increased 8% sequentially. International revenue was $1 billion, or 42% of revenue, and increased 11% sequentially. 
Europe continues to drive most of our growth outside the United States, with the UK at 15% of revenue, or $370 million, up 8% sequentially. Germany continues to be our second strong market in Europe, but our investments in smaller markets are paying off. We saw double-digit growth in many countries, including Spain, Italy, Israel, Finland, Norway and Poland. 
Outside of Europe, emerging markets in Asia and Latin America still represent a relatively small percentage of our total revenues, but continue to show strong revenue growth as we increase our hiring and investments in these regions. Traffic growth in Asia and Latin America was particularly strong this quarter. The World Cup did modestly impact traffic in certain countries, but did not have a material impact on revenues. 
Foreign exchange impacted revenue positively this quarter, as revenue would have been $26 million lower in Q2 had foreign exchange rates remained constant from Q1 through Q2. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from Q2 of '05 through Q2 of '06, international revenues this quarter would have been $18 million higher. 
Turning to TAC, traffic acquisition costs were $785 million, or 32% of advertising revenue. The majority of TAC is related to payments to our AdSense partners. Toolbar distribution deals are typically accounted for as TAC if they are revenue-sharing in nature. In Q2, as in prior periods, TAC related to payments to distribution partners represented an immaterial percentage of advertising revenue. 
Operating expenses included $107 million in stock-based compensation and totaled $652 million. These expenses included $342 million in headcount-related and facilities expense, as we ramped up hiring across our organization, particularly in sales and marketing and R&D; and $49 million in advertising and promotional expenses, including $24 million related to Toolbar distribution deals. We expect operating expenses to increase in the future due to continued aggressive hiring as well as marketing programs, including strategic distribution deals. 
Non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock-based compensation, remains strong at $925 million, with non-GAAP operating margins of 38%, a sequential decline during this period of continued investment. As we have previously discussed, margins may decline as we continue to invest in the business. 
In Q2, CapEx totaled $699 million. A substantial portion of CapEx was related to opportunistic real estate purchases of $319 million during Q2, about half of which was from existing lease conversions and half from investments to support future growth. The balance of CapEx was largely related to data center builds and infrastructure-related expenditures, including servers and network equipment, as well as data centers. 
As we further improve and increase the sophistication of our core search and ads, we require customized infrastructure to deliver faster and better service to our users. The significant majority of our infrastructure spending supports our core search and ads platform, with the remainder supporting newer products and initiatives. 
Our investments in core technology historically have paid off very handsomely for us in terms of our results. Rest assured that the decisions that we're making around capital expenditures are carefully thought out and prudently debated. Note that a significant portion of our CapEx spending is related to build versus lease decisions around data centers; and buy versus lease decisions around real estate. By making these investments upfront, we expect to reduce our overall cost of operations over the long run. 
We noted during our last call that CapEx growth would be substantially greater than the annual revenue growth rate in 2006, and we continue to anticipate this going into the second half of the year. 
Now, turning to cash, our balance sheet remained very healthy, with our total cash position standing at nearly $10 billion at June 30. Cash flow from operations was $841 million, and free cash flow -- which we define as cash flow from operations, less CapEx -- was $142 million. Q2 free cash flow was significantly impacted by the investments in IT infrastructure and the real estate that I just discussed. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% and 27% for the six months ended June 30th of 2006. We currently anticipate that our effective tax rate for the full year will be at or below 30%. We recorded a one-time gain from the sale of our investment in Baidu of $55 million. This and the related tax effect have been excluded from our non-GAAP calculation of income. 
Turning to headcount, our headcount at June 30th was 7,942 an increase of 1,152 over Q1. While the majority of our hires are still in the U.S., the proportion of employees that are being hired internationally, particularly in India and Ireland, has been steadily increasing, consistent with our efforts to build our operations overseas and develop local products for local markets. We expect to continue to hire aggressively around the world, particularly in Q3, across all functions, especially sales, marketing and R&D. 
In closing, I'd like to reiterate that we are pleased with this quarter, despite the seasonal impact on traffic. Looking ahead to Q3, we anticipate traffic levels will continue to reflect slower seasonal patterns, while we do expect to see continued benefits from ongoing ad quality initiatives in future quarters. 
We will continue to make strategic investments to allow us to maintain our leadership position in search and ads and to pursue additional growth opportunities. Now I'll turn it over to Larry for more comments. 
 Larry Page
Thanks, George. We continue to focus on helping users worldwide to create designs and share information. We are focused on improving the user experience online and increasing the usage of Google products. This is how we measure our success. 
We're excited that we will introduce many new products for international users this quarter. Localizing our products is an important step in broadening our reach with users worldwide and strengthening our brand and share in markets outside the U.S. 
We delivered nearly 200 localized versions of products in this quarter alone, including Toolbar 4 in 15 new languages, Google Pack in 10 additional languages, Google News in Arabic, Google Talk in 13 languages, and the personalized homepage in four languages. We are also making international search a top priority by improving relevance and adding new features. 
We are bringing more of our products to mobile phone users. Since there are at least twice as many mobile phones than PCs in use globally, and mobile usage is growing faster than PCs, we want to make Google available in a device-independent way. 
Mobile phone users can now access Gmail, news and a personalized homepage in French, Italian, German and more. We launched Maps for mobile in several additional countries, and we are creating more opportunities for advertisers to reach users through mobile devices. We launched mobile ads in Japan in April, and the early results are very positive. We expect to roll out mobile ads in additional countries later this year. 
We also made some great strides towards growing our developer community, a very important group of partners that will help us grow the Google user base. We also now have APIs available for many of our products, including AdWords, Blogger, Calendar, Maps, Gadgets, and Checkout. And partners like Salesforce.com, Cisco and SAS are now developing modules with the OneBox API for Enterprise to allow large organizations to search a wider range of corporate data through the Google Enterprise Search appliance. 
We also continue to broaden our targeted branding solutions for advertisers. Many large and small advertisers are already taking advantage of click to play video ads on our content network, while auto companies like GM and Honda are running their TV ads on the Google network as a way to extend their reach from offline to online media. 
Entertainment companies like Lions Gate and Fox are using Google for branding initiatives. For the release of the movie An Inconvenient Truth, Paramount Vantage selected hundreds of environmental news and independent film sites that they knew would reach their target demographic, and ran a two-minute trailer. The combination of targeted reach and video helped drive people to movie theaters. According to exit polls, over 30% of people who saw An Inconvenient Truth on opening weekend were exposed to Paramount's online ads. 
Now I will turn it over to Sergey to talk some more about what we're doing for our advertisers. 
Sergey Brin
Thanks, Larry. As Eric mentioned earlier, we continue to innovate in advertising. We introduced some very exciting products and services that allow our base of hundreds of thousands of advertisers to better target their ads and generate more sales. 
We made it easier for advertisers to manage their accounts quickly and efficiently by offering AdWords Editor for free. We also introduced AdScheduling, which gives advertisers greater control over the timing of the delivery of their ads, and allows them to drive greater return on AdWords as a whole. 
We are constantly making changes to AdWords to improve quality. We believe that by increasing ad quality, our users will continue to rely on ads to find the products and services they're looking for. We believe this is a win for everyone. Our users benefit by finding useful sites, advertisers benefit from qualified leads, and Google benefits from more long-term monetization opportunities. 
In the quarter we made numerous changes to the way we serve ads that help us to show the best ad at the best time. For instance, one of our improvements involved showing fewer ads while users were looking for non-commercial information rather than seeking to purchase something, while showing more highly relevant ads when our users are searching for products and services. 
Finally, we were very happy to introduce Google Checkout this quarter. We have spent a lot of time thinking about how we can help our users more easily shop online, while helping our advertisers generate more sales. Studies show that about 63% of users abandon their shopping cart before they complete the buying process. Google Checkout significantly improves and simplifies this process, while also benefiting merchants by delivering higher click-throughs, conversions, and ROI. We believe these benefits will increase advertiser spending and bring more advertisers to Google. 
While we only recently launched Checkout, we have already received very positive feedback from users, and we are seeing very healthy adoption rates from all types of advertisers; from large offline retailers to small online merchants, including Buy.com, Bluefly, Starbucks, Back Country, and many more. 
Eric spoke a lot about partnerships, and they will be very important to the success of Google Checkout. We are working with financial institutions like Citi Cards to co-market Checkout to their customers. We have also developed partnerships with e-commerce service providers like GSI Commerce, Monster Commerce, and Channel Advisor, to help merchants integrate Google Checkout into their website. We think this is one of the most exciting products we have announced this year, and expect to see great results in the near future. 
With that, I will turn it over to Eric. 
Eric Schmidt
Thanks very much, Sergey. As you can see, we're very, very proud of our results. A couple of themes that you hear through this. One, of course, is the rapid expansion of our international businesses. The world is a very big place and Google has very much a worldwide mission. You're going to see more and more international focus, international expansion, international growth. 
Another is the investment in new products has continued apace. The primary investment, of course, according to our 70% rule, is in search and ads. When we talk about search -- we talk about search in everything -- and when we talk about ads, we talk about more than just the text ads. Indeed, we have many interesting trials, partnerships and new products in that space to offer even more advertising services to the audiences worldwide. 
We are in a wonderful situation that we are able to now in fact increase the standards by which we select and hire new people into the Company. Currently we say we've raised the hiring bar. Even with that, we've been able to continue our expansion in headcount, especially internationally and outside the United States. 
We talked a little bit about mobile and how important mobile is, and how so many people will ultimately be using mobile as their information source, and not just from an information perspective, but also from a monetization perspective, as we mentioned. We don't see any signs of approaching any limits to this vision. The opportunities before us really are unlimited at this point. So with that, I'd be interested in your questions, comments, thoughts. 
Kim? 
We're trying to get our operator on here. While we're doing this, we'll introduce Omid Kordestani an employee who runs all of our business operations. He's been on the call a few times; runs worldwide operations, customer service, all of our businesses, all of our deals. Welcome, Omid. 
Salar Kamangar, one of the original inventors of the ad system, is here to talk a lot about the economics and structure of our advertising system. Do we have the operator? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We do. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Imran Khan - JP Morgan. 
Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Hi everybody, good afternoon. Two questions. Eric, you talked about that one of your key goals is international expansion. If I look at international, could you give us some sense about the relevant fit quality of search in the international versus U.S., and the coverage in the international market versus U.S.? 
Primarily we are more interested in the European market versus U.S. That would be very helpful. 
Secondly, if I look at this last quarter growth rate, and if I ex out foreign currency, it seems like the U.S. and international growth rate was pretty relative. But it seems like U.S. is still growing pretty significantly the growth rate, while Europe is still very early. Can you help us understand what's driving the U.S. growth rate? Thanks. 
Eric Schmidt
For part of the answer I can tell you that the quality in coverage in Europe is very similar to that of the United States. Depending on what assumptions we make about market share, we have strong market share in most of those countries, the brand is very, very strong. There's not much difference in user behavior, except, of course, the languages are different, but the quality there is very, very good. 
The ad businesses are also very strong. Those are mature markets with strong e-commerce models, et cetera. With respect to overall growth rate, Omid, do you want to talk about that? 
Omid Kordestani
Sure. In terms of business, yes, you're correct. We are seeing that our strategy is playing out really well in the United States and, frankly, the rest of the world. We are trying to leverage all channels of sales and operations effectively. People who are very sophisticated at using our ads and our APIs are now, in a lot of cases, directly interacting with our systems. 
Our sales force in the fields in both regions, in all regions across the world, is working on opportunities with Fortune customers, with boutique customers, and also testing the new branding initiatives, off-site initiatives. So we are growing the base, we are leveraging all the sales channels, and then we are testing the new initiatives. 
Imran Khan - JP Morgan
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney - Citigroup. 
 Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about Google Checkout. Two questions: a financial question. Can Google Checkout be profitable for you as a stand-alone business, or are your assumptions that the knock-on effects related to more AdWords spending, higher click-through rates, that's what really makes it financially compelling to you? 
Secondly, just in terms of the product itself, I know you talked qualitatively about some impact it's already having in the field with advertisers. Can you quantify that or provide a little bit more color? Are you seeing a material increase? I know it's early, but a material increase in ad buyers' budgets as they join up with Checkout? Thanks. 
Eric Schmidt
Of course, the good news is things happen very fast at Google. But we've only had the product out for a couple of weeks, so it's very early to comment on it. We did Checkout to solve the problem that Sergey described, which is we simply want to make the whole process of buying just quicker, more foolproof, more likely to conclude. 
We think that that ultimately will translate into higher value for the advertiser, which should ultimately be reflected in our overall revenue. But of course it's an indirect benefit. Salar, do you want to talk a little bit about Checkout? 
Salar Kamangar
Sure. As Eric mentioned, everything about the product design, as well as the pricing model, is oriented towards helping users not just find the merchants and the ads, but also then complete the transaction. So it's for this reason that we have set up some incentives that have to do with AdWords spending. 
Our goal is long-term to increase the amount of searches and commercial searches on Google, increase the click-through rates to our advertisers, and increase the conversion rates that these customers get because of increased convenience. So we're really thinking about the business as a way of adding to our overall ad network. 
 Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thank you. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs. 
Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. Eric, you talked about a lot of innovation. I was wondering if you could comment on the benefits from a couple of different things that were deployed during the quarter? The first is the number of sponsored links on commercial versus non-commercial terms. What have you learned from that in terms of benefits to the user and to the advertiser, and also buying? 
Secondly, what benefits do you see in terms of increasing the reach of advertisers from launching vertical categories such as Google Finance? Does it allow you to increase your reach within that vertical type of advertisers? Thank you. 
Eric Schmidt
Thank you very much. We're busy fine-tuning the ad network. And as you noted in the premise of your question, there is a set of commercial terms that we can trigger on. When we see those, we can do things that are even more valuable to the end user. If they're more valuable to the end user, it generates more value to the advertiser. 
The most extreme form of that would be a specialized site like Google Finance, where we know the user cares a lot about finance. So it should be the case that an advertiser advertising on Google Finance would convert more highly, the revenue would be greater, the ads would have greater value, and should ultimately translate into more revenue for the Company, if the product is successful in the eyes of an end user. 
So once again, it's end user value, targeting the ads, running these experiments with commercial versus non-commercial, then all of that generates, ultimately, greater return for Google. Next question? 
Operator
Our next question comes from Marianne Wolk - Susquehanna. 
Marianne Wolk - Susquehanna
Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you're doing with the display advertising, and in particular where you are in your timetable with AOL. 
Eric Schmidt
Omid. 
Omid Kordestani
We are joining a lot of tests with different advertisers, different partners. As was mentioned during the call, for example, it was through the AdSense network we were running some of the click-to-play video advertising and evaluating the results of those tests. 
With AOL, we have a very long list of milestones and projects that we are actively executing on, and we're on track with that partnership. So our hope is to really become a big player in this space. And we are doing a lot of tests, we're doing a lot of learning and fine-tuning our products. 
Marianne Wolk - Susquehanna
Do you anticipate the display business being pay for performance? 
Omid Kordestani
At this point it's probably easier for us to use our existing models, and if the option system is working very well, and the advertisers are familiar with that system and using it very well. We are very much open to testing different models as we learn, and adopt those if they make sense. 
Marianne Wolk - Susquehanna
Thank you. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley. 
 Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley 
Thank you. Eric, you talked a lot about partnerships at the beginning of the call. And you obviously are in a unique position to set up win-win relationships with your partners -- you get them traffic; you give them a revenue share. Could you drill down a little bit more on your revenue share philosophy with some of these partners, whether it's Dell, whether it's Adobe, whether it's the mobile players? 
A second question, you talked about your enthusiasm associated with the growth in video. Can you give us any qualitative or quantitative comments on rates of growth, degree of growth, percent of usage? Thanks. 
Eric Schmidt
On the philosophy around our partnerships, we've typically given the majority of the value, if you will, to the advertiser, to the partner who brings the end user. So typically, in the structure we help drive, the majority of the revenue -- and the shares are pretty high -- goes to companies like AOL and Ask Jeeves and so forth. We get tremendous benefit, though from that, because then those advertisers are part of our overall advertiser network and so our Google.com property gets that benefit. 
Although the specific terms with, for example, Dell are very much proprietary and part of a contract, we entered a similar arrangement with Dell after an awful lot of testing. The idea was that here's Dell, a very, very interesting, very, very important company, and their end users would benefit by having more access to Google. It's worth it to us to share that revenue in whatever financial structure makes sense, so that the end user is satisfied; Dell, of course, it's a good business for them, and it's a very good business for us. 
So the answer depends on the kind of partnership. Is it a content partner? Is it a distribution partner? Is it an ad partner? Do they bring in users? What is the economic structure of their industry? 
But all of them have some form of financial sharing -- although maybe not revenue, there may be other ways of doing it -- that gets them to where they need to be with respect to their economics, and gets our goals aligned. Omid, do you want to talk a little bit about the overall structure? 
Omid Kordestani
Sure. As Eric mentioned, we really did exhaustive analysis on all these partnerships, really trying to understand the long-term value of those users, the incremental revenue they generate, and really build sophisticated financial models that bring value to our partner, as well as protect our long-term revenues, incremental revenues and market share. That's how we really struck all these partnerships. 
In terms of your question about video, we really are focused on comprehensiveness here. We struck all kinds of partnerships, from Wimbledon to U.S. Soccer, Sundance Channel, UC Berkeley, and we're really focused not only on the tail of this and a lot of the uploading of videos from user-generated content, but a lot of premium partnerships as well. 
Once again, we're doing a lot of learning here. A lot of new features are getting introduced, and we're also testing different ad formats to match this. 
Eric Schmidt
It's worth adding, by the way, that internally when we did the strategy in this area, we said we are in the search business, so we need all of the information. We want to partner with people to get information so our search end users can see it. 
We're also in the advertising business, and we'd like to provide advertising services to people who have their own proprietary content. So depending on where we are in that spectrum, we either do an advertising deal or a content deal or a hybrid deal. 
But ultimately our goal at Google is to have the strongest advertising network and all the world's information, that's part of our mission. 
 Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley 
Thanks, Omid. Thanks, Eric. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Bob Peck - Bear Stearns. 
 Bob Peck - Bear Stearns
With Yahoo!'s announcement the other day that they were clearing out some of their affiliates, could you talk a little bit about the impact of your new landing page quality score and what that's designed to do? 
Number two, could you also talk a little bit more about your progress over at dMarc? When should we expect this to hit financially and see more news around the radio efforts? 
Salar Kamangar
This is Salar. I will speak to the ad quality question. From the beginning, quality has been the hallmark of our ad system. The very first thing we did was to incorporate signals like click-through rate into the ranking method. Beginning at the end of last year, we saw that there was a problem where sometimes users would get great creative ads, but the landing pages that they'd be taken to were of lower quality. So beginning in last year, we began incorporating signals from the landing page into the ranking method and the final quality score. 
We had another incremental launch in that spirit earlier this month, and we think the impact of that has been very beneficial to users. It has produced a small number of advertisers that were engaging in arbitrage and other methods that resulted in lower-quality ads, and as a result, has allowed us to show more ads from higher-quality customers. So we expect to keep evolving the quality signal to incorporate more information, including landing page data. 
Eric Schmidt
On the dMarc question, we are in the process of introducing AdSense for radio, which is essentially the integration of the dMarc Console and management tools into our advertising network. The dMarc team itself is fully integrated. We're expanding it both in engineering and sales. We're also doing it worldwide, not just in the U.S. There's a number of very, very interesting deals being negotiated. They're on an integration schedule of about three months from now, so every week there are more milestones, and they're working very hard. It's very exciting. 
 Bob Peck - Bear Stearns
Thank you. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Ben Schachter - UBS. 
Ben Schachter - UBS
Congratulations on a very solid quarter. I was wondering if you could give us some insight into your interest in the healthcare field? Should we look for Google to focus on the consumers seeking information, on healthcare providers conducting business and organizing their information, or are there even broader aspirations in healthcare? Thank you. 
Sergey Brin
We got an interest in healthcare primarily because there have been so many companies and organizations that actually have approached us interested in healthcare, how the kinds of technologies that we create could be used to help in their states, countries, and deal with various healthcare issues. 
The first thing that we've done was a part of the launch of Google Co-op, where we improved the quality of our health search. We partnered with a variety of organizations. I'll probably get the list a little bit wrong, but I think it was NIH and MCBI and organizations such as that, CDC, to help us annotate and draw people towards more authoritative sources, or sources more appropriate to them as consumers or doctors, or healthcare providers of various sorts, just to improve the search. 
I think that's a great product that's in its infancy, and we're very excited about it. It's also going to be used in other sectors as well. 
But more broadly, we've seen that health information has a lot of similarities to the kinds of challenges we deal with in terms of just textual information. So we would like to make sure that for this important issue to many people around the world, of health, that we're actually able to contribute our technology to solve some of those problems. 
We don't have a specific plan as of yet, but we're exploring a number of areas where we feel our technology could benefit people. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Christa Sober Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners. 
 Christa Sober Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
The first question centers on the embedding of conversion data into your ranking algorithms. How far along are you with that? Do you have a desire to develop a CPA product? It sounds like there was some mention of that during the quarter. Also if you could update us on your pay-per-call initiatives. Thanks 
Eric Schmidt
Just to avoid any confusion, the search results from Google are not affected by the advertising business, and there is no relationship between what the advertising folks are doing with their ranking, their algorithms, the auction and so forth and what many people have called natural search, the normal Google results. 
So with that, Salar, maybe you could talk about the ad part of this, and how we are using the new signals and so forth for both conversion data as well as pay-per-call. 
Salar Kamangar
On the conversion side, what we've done to date is to put the information power in the hands of the customer through two products. One is a conversion tracking feature which they invoke from AdWords. Second is through the Google Analytics product, which is now incorporated fully into the AdWords interface. 
We want this information to be available to customers in a very real-time manner so that they can immediately adjust their bids if they need to, based on changes in conversion rate information. 
On the pay-per-call question, we think that's a very exciting area, because there's a large number of businesses, especially in the longer tail, more local businesses, that don't have need for sophisticated websites, and they rely primarily on phone calls that drive their leads. 
We are now doing a small test with a product that we've been working on that's running on the content network, and we're going to keep evolving that and iterating it to improve the product until it's ready to be launched. 
 Christa Sober Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
Just a quick follow-up there. So, you are indeed embedding the conversion information that you're getting from Urchin into the prioritization of the ads, and then that's what's sort of helping you develop the CPA side? 
Salar Kamangar
No, that's very different. That information sits in the hands of the advertisers, and they can adjust their bids if they like. Conversion rate signals are not affecting the ranking. 
 Christa Sober Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners

Our next question comes from Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray. 
Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray
Good afternoon. Congratulations on a solid quarter. First, could you give us your assessment of if you're still gaining market share? And if so, what do you think is contributing to that market share gain? 
Second, a question on the international front. It seems like two of the potentially largest markets, China and Russia, have posed some challenges where there are frontrunners and you are not number one. They may be one of the few countries where you are not number one. 
Could you give us your sense of if you are seeing this type of local competition that has captured the top market share elsewhere? How do you plan to deal with these kind of local players that may be emerging? Thank you. 
Omid Kordestani
Hi, Safa, this is Omid. I think Sergey and I are going to respond to you. We, first of all, believe in terms of the public data that's out there from research companies, we believe the data is directionally correct. Our internal estimates differ in terms of precision with that data. 
In general we think we are doing really well in the United States and in Europe, and, as you mentioned, in some of those local more emerging markets for us, we have more challenges there. I think the equation there is one we are aware of how to solve. We need local engineering talent. We need local product innovation. We are busy trying to staff those operations. 
Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray
Do you think in the U.S. you are gaining market share? And if so, what's helping you with that? 
Sergey Brin
This is Sergey. Maybe I'll take the rest of that. I think we've really accelerated the development of our products, specifically with respect to search. We're just devoting an enormous number of resources to it, and we've made tremendous strides in relevance and comprehensiveness, in ease-of-use, and freshness also. I think the end users really appreciate that and sympathize with that. I think our reputation has also grown with that. I think that's really helped here. 
I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the other markets you mentioned, Russia and China. By the way, those are probably not the only two challenging markets for us. Also I would include Korea. There are probably a few others here and there. There have been some unique circumstances in each of those countries. 
In China, for example, as you know, we have had some connectivity availability and latency issues. There are also some different product needs in that particular country. But we're now getting to be quite well staffed there, and have been addressing some of those and I think we're making good strides. 
In Russia, which you know, I'm embarrassed to say we're not number one in, but there's a very strong company there, Yandex, which has been very talented. They've been doing search since 1990 or something. But primarily, Russia has some unique language features, which we've been addressing recently. Some of the recent rollouts have really improved our Russian language search quality, and I hope that will help us. 
We've also recently opened an engineering office in Moscow, and for a short while we've also had a sales office there. I think we're going to really improve in those geographies and I hope we continue to improve in some of the others where we're not number one as well.

Great, thanks.

Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
I just wanted to follow-up on some of the questions regarding Google Checkout and the CPA potential rollout. I'm wondering to what degree is Google Checkout a step toward a truly success-based pay-per-transaction search model down the line? Thank you. 
Eric Schmidt
I think it's a very interesting idea. That's not what Checkout is today. Checkout is really a mechanism that allows people to more quickly buy products they want to buy. Roughly speaking, it remembers who you are, it provides a level of anonymity, and all of our testing indicates that people are much more likely to purchase from our advertisers if they have enabled Google Checkout. 
Salar Kamangar
In our CPA trials, we are letting advertisers provide information to us through conversion tracking products that help us with the CPA tracking. But we don't have any plans right now to use Checkout information for anything outside of Checkout. 
We have a lot of safeguards in place to make sure that the information from users is in their control. For example, Checkout lets users not share their full credit card information with merchants. It lets them not share their e-mail address with merchants. Instead it sets up an e-mail forwarding system. We will never rent or sell their information to other places. If we do anything further with the data, we will, as we always do, be very transparent with how we do that in a way that the user has control over.

Our next question comes from Justin Post - Merrill Lynch. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
The Google network revenues were up 58% year over year. Just wondering if you can help us understand whether the majority of the growth was from the strength of existing partners, or did you add several new partners on a year-over-year basis. 
Secondly, can you just talk a little bit about the macro environment? Certainly, feedback indicates ROI from search has been very strong. With the economy potentially slowing down, how do you think that will affect search spending? 
Omid Kordestani
This is Omid. In terms of your question about the partnerships, we are experiencing both growth from some of the key partners that are doing well, or they're promoting the content better. 
So last quarter specifically, there were several partners that we renewed our partnership with and got better placements on their sites, as well as noticing them doing different implementations of their UI and spending more marketing promoting their sites. So we benefited from those factors. 
So we're very much busy, both renewing these partnerships and expanding them. I don't think there was any significant new addition. It was a collection of the overall performance and some of these adjustments. And the other question, I think, Eric would like to address. 
Eric Schmidt
On the question about what happens in a potential global economic slowdown to a very strong product like the ROI-based advertising we do, it's of course a matter of speculation what might happen. We do have some experience with this, which was after 9/11 in the United States. Again, the Company was much, much smaller, so I don't know if this is analogous. But a number of us were very concerned that everybody would just stop spending. And during that period, instead of stopping spending, people accelerated their transition to Google, which was, obviously, very positive, but also quite a surprise. 
The reason was that when organizations are under stress, they focus on the best economics, because they don't have as many opportunities, they have to be much more careful. We continue to believe that the Google advertising system is literally the best place to put your sales dollars. 
In a theoretical global recession such as what you were asking about, I'm sure that we would benefit by the fact that our performance is simply better than the other alternatives. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch

Our next question comes from Heath Terry - Credit Suisse. 
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit specifically about your strategy in Japan. Where is that business relative to, say, the service level that you've rolled out here in the U.S., and how do you view your market share progress there and strategy going forward? 
Omid Kordestani
We've actually spent a lot of time on Japan recently, and very much interested in increasing our investments there. I think it's going to happen in multiple fronts. We are very focused on expanding our engineering and product presence there, as well as additional investments in our direct sales force, field sales forces, and service operations. The model is really working well there, and the economy is really improving there, and I think we just hope to be able to execute better to investments. 
 We also have been very successful with some recent partnerships -- the KDDI deal that we just announced; also with it had the launch of our mobile ads in Japan. We think, based on the early results -- it literally launched a day ago -- we are very optimistic about its performance. But we're excited about the market and we'll continue to invest in it.

Our next question comes from Bill Morrison - JMP Securities. 
 Bill Morrison - JMP Securities 
I was wondering if you could from a high level, characterize or break down your sequential growth of 9% in terms of volume and monetization, if possible? 
Secondly, I was wondering if you guys could comment on the net neutrality debate. You've been out there in front of this leading the charge for net neutrality. I was just wondering if you could give us the status of where we are at, how long it might be until there's some resolution. 
I'm also curious if you've done any modeling or analysis, if net neutrality were to go away, what kind of an impact it might have on your margins? Thanks. 
George Reyes
This is George. On the question you asked around monetization. Early in the quarter we put in place our usual rigor in terms of trying to identify product quality improvements that we could drive. Quite frankly, it was those product improvements that really helped shape the quarter to the 9% growth rate. 
So we're pretty pleased with that, and of course many of the benefits that we incurred this quarter will spill over into next quarter. This is sort of an every day, every quarter thing, the way we try and drive ad quality improvements. 
Sergey Brin
I wanted to discuss the net neutrality question. People, I guess, don't believe us when we say this, but we really care about net neutrality, not for Google as a company, but rather for all the small Internet companies out there. 
We remember back in '98, '99, when we were a little company and the ability to play on equal footing with much larger companies, and have our service accessible equally around the Internet, was really a fantastic opportunity that really allowed us to build the Company. 
Today, we have a fair number of resources at our disposal. We have partnerships with many of the big ISPs as it is. We have good relationships with them. We have a brand that end users are very attracted to. So I don't see it so much as us being affected by a hypothetical end of net neutrality, but rather all those other Internet sites. 
Of course, being a search company, we really care about them. We want there to be a really healthy Internet ecosystem, and that's why we're fighting hard for net neutrality. 
Eric Schmidt
Larry, you have some opinions about this as well. 
 Larry Page
I was just going to add, I think that we have a blessing with the Internet -- this amazing thing where you can connect to any country or any website, and it works pretty well, and there's actually expectation among all the ISPs and all the people who carry traffic for you that they do as good a job as possible. 
There's been a very concerted marketing effort on the other side of this that the Internet is going to melt down or things like that. Actually, people have been saying that for the last 10 years, and it hasn't happened, because the Internet is an amazing, adaptive system, with many, many people making it all work. Engineers all work hard to make it work reliably, and it has been tremendously reliable and tremendously increased in speed. 
We don't see any issues, we're delivering a lot of video. We don't see any issues with the video we're delivering, or any of the other services potentially having issues. We don't think that's an issue at all. We think the Internet will continue to grow tremendously as it is. 
I'd also point out that it's largely been driven in countries like the U.S., where we have very poor last-mile connections for users, much slower than in countries like South Korea, which has spent less money and has much better connections, and haven't been pushing for elimination of net neutrality.

Our next question comes from Jordan Rohan - RBC. 
Jordan Rohan - RBC
I was hoping you could give me a little bit of insight into the progress that's being made in mobile advertising? It seems like mobile advertising is an area of much promise, yet little advertising revenue worldwide. 
Can you cite some examples -- and I realize they may have to be in Korean markets or Japanese markets, or areas outside the U.S. -- where mobile advertising is really helping to drive consumers into retail locations, and whether or not Google has been able to take advantage of that? Thank you. 
Omid Kordestani
I mentioned this one earlier, where our partnership with KDDI in Japan is a really good example of us being focused on this space, and having very good results in the last day or so that we have launched the service. We do believe that we have tremendous advantage here. We understand search really well. 
On mobile devices, the usage model is about finding information rather than browsing, and obviously, also the network of advertisers, which is very much global and strong. We can easily adapt that model to the mobile devices and make that network of advertisers flow into these different platforms. 
So it's exactly what you said; we believe in this potential. Mobile devices are the primary usage device in a lot of these countries. The combination of search capability and the targeting abilities that we have, and the existing knowledge that we have, is going to really be a great advantage for us. 
 Larry Page
I was just going to add, there are significant sized markets now selling digital goods in places like Asia, which are things like ringtones and games for your phones and things like that, that are also being driven by advertising. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Denise Garcia - WR Hambrecht. 
Denise Garcia - WR Hambrecht
Congratulations on that impressive quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about new types of advertising platforms that you're moving into? I know we just got a question on mobile, but I'm also curious about video, and also the CPA program that you have. 
You had mentioned that part of the strength in the Google model is that your advertising is priced on this ROI basis. I'm wondering if in these other platforms you might be pricing them on a CPM basis, or moving into other types of pricing strategies? And how that might affect your overall business as these other platforms grow, and how you see the growth there? 
Salar Kamangar
We really have two different focus areas. One is, again, on the smaller advertisers, where our products like pay-per-call, we think, will make a big difference; as well as simplification of the AdWords system. We have launched several improvements to AdWords to make it easier for an advertiser to figure out which keywords to choose and figure out how to bid. The most recent thing was the AdWords Starter Edition, which greatly reduces the number of steps needed to get an advertiser on Google. 
On the other side, we want to keep increasing both the ad types as well as the different placement areas for advertisers. One of the interesting things about our model is that advertisers often have set budgets that are much higher than we're able to deliver to. So it's really up to us to have fast quality improvements and look for new sources of inventory to help increase the number of customers to these businesses. 
 Larry Page
I just wanted to add, I think there's already starting to be a fair amount of complexity in how all the different kinds of customers we have and how they pay and which models they use and so on. I expect that that will continue, and we'll continue to have different products for different kinds of advertisers with different ways of paying. 
I know there's a lot of talk about the CPA, or paying per purchase. One of the issues with that is people look around a lot before they buy something. So it's probably not the only information you want to look at when you're paying for advertising. But we're also excited about using more data like that in our models.

Our next question comes from Youssef Squali - Jeffries & Co. 
 Youssef Squali - Jeffries & Co.
Thank you very much. Eric, can you just speak to the success of your display product? I'm thinking particularly about site targeting, which didn't get much of a mention today. How big is it? In relationship to the overall growth of the business, did it grow faster or slower? 
Second, George, you've spent, I guess by my math, about somewhere between $700 million and $750 million on what I would call maintenance CapEx in the first half of the year. Is that a good run rate for the year, understanding that obviously does not include some of the real estate investments you just made? 
Omid Kordestani
Let me take the first part of that, which is the display advertising question and site targeting. We are actually very busy with our sales force approaching all of our customer base, and really going through the education process, the optimization, creating custom channels for these advertisers to reach the metrics and goals that they have. We are having success. It is not something that we can kind of broadly talk about yet. We are waiting to really gain more experience in different verticals from a different set of customers. 
We have customers that are pretty big advertisers with us and they really like the results they're seeing, and the learning is really helping both of us expand here. So I agree, we haven't talked about it much. I think we would like to wait until we have more success under our belt and more customers, and more performance to talk about. 
Eric Schmidt
Salar, you have an example of this. 
Salar Kamangar
One of the more recent things that we worked on is on the video ad side. We already accept video ads in any format, convert them into flash, and display them in our network. One of the more recent things that we've released is a click-to-play video, where a user has a choice of clicking on the image, which will trigger a Google Video-based ad. 
I think what's interesting about this is it's very consistent with the philosophy we have with all revenue advertising types. We want to make sure that it's something that adds value to the user, that it's something that the user is choosing to do. When you have this type of approach, I think it leads to higher conversion rates and higher satisfaction of the advertisers. 
George Reyes
On your question around CapEx, Eric just had a wonderful suggestion, which is to blame it on Larry and Sergey, all this CapEx that we're adding. But realistically, we think we can't put too much CapEx into the system. It's a really critical part of our competitive advantage and our infrastructure. It's something that you're going to continue to see quite substantial investment going forward over the next few quarters. 
 Youssef Squali - Jeffries & Co.
No acceleration or deceleration? 
George Reyes
There will be definitely an acceleration. 
 Youssef Squali - Jeffries & Co.

Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we will take our final question from Mark May - Needham & Co. 
 Mark May - Needham & Co.
Thanks a lot. With regard to your partnerships program, and in particular the Toolbar distribution deals, I think you referenced that in your prepared remarks. Can you walk through the benefit of spending, for example, $24 million in a quarter for Toolbar distribution? How many incremental new customers do you estimate that you can acquire through spending that amount? What is the impact on usage and, ultimately, revenue from customers that you acquire through these agreements? That's the only question. Thanks. 
Omid Kordestani
We will take a look at all of these deals very, very carefully and want to make sure that they are strategic for us. It is about giving users access to our search capabilities, and creating a more personalized browsing experience, and the various search access points that a user may have when they either purchase a PC or download a new application, that they get to have access to our services, and not only grow our search market share, but protect it. 
As I mentioned earlier, in all of these deals, we do a very sophisticated set of analysis on understanding the long-term value of the user to us, the incremental revenue we are generating, or in some cases the kind of revenue that we may be cannibalizing; and really take all of those factors into effect, and make sure that this makes business sense for us and ensure that revenue with the partners. 
 Larry Page
I was just going to add, this may be acknowledged by some of our competitors, we have very, very strong monetization on search. This gives us a nice benefit when we're negotiating these kind of deals to make them both a win for the partner and for us. 
Eric Schmidt
Thanks Omid, thanks Larry, thanks Sergey, thanks George, thanks Salar, thanks Kim. We've reached the end of our time. I wanted to make sure that at the end of this call we emphasized that Google really is committed to providing the best end user search experience worldwide. That's not just on PCs or Macs; it's on every device against every piece of content. 
We're going to continue to get better and better at providing the best and most relevant search. It is the core part of what we do. We use feedback from customers, as we test our products, and we're always going to stay true to that with respect to the products that we have now and the many, many products coming up in the future. So with that, thank you very, very much.

 Eric Schmidt
Well, thank you very much, Kim. We are obviously very happy with our Q1 results. The Company is very much executing against the strategy we have told you about. We basically have good news across the board, across the whole business. 
We have made a lot of progress on what we consider to be our highest strategic priority, both search quality and end-user traffic. And it looks to us like we continue to gain market share. There's a recent Keynote study, for example, that concluded that Google was number one in overall user search experience and, of course, in local search and image search. Our own internal estimates show that we're gaining share in all of our key markets in the US, UK and newer markets like India. Third-party data seems to support all of the trends that we see internally. 
I should point out that we believe that the audience reach we offer our advertisers across Google.com and all our network sites is very much the largest in the world. We provide an unmatched audience breadth for our advertisers, and this of course is why so many are coming to Google. I don't think this is generally understood, is how big our reach really is. 
Our international gains were very, very strong this quarter and we expect that, of course, to continue. Europe is doing extremely well for us, much larger offices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. We organize them by industry vertical. We brought out a new practice involving our agencies called Best Practice Funding with near 100% sign-up rate, and a whole bunch of changes in the way we work with our advertisers that are consistent with what we have done in the United States, and are producing much better performance for them and much better economics for Google. 
All of us, the majority of us, were recently in China, where we announced, among other things, a launch of our major R&D center in Beijing and a new Chinese name for all of our Chinese properties, and we expect lots of good news there shortly. 
In the area that we really focus on, which is the end user and the end user value proposition, Larry is going to talk a lot through the products that we have done. I wanted to highlight some of the progress we have made in mobile, which is another big strategic area for us. We have a transcoder now that will go from one format to another. Google Maps, of course, is incredibly successful now on BlackBerries, Google News Mobile and many, many more deals coming with leading mobile providers. A big, big new area for us and something we have been working on for about a year. 
We also talked in our financial analyst meeting about locally targeted ads, and that is an increasingly meaningful contributor to revenues. We just launched, for example, local business ads. There's much more coming as we combine advertising and local and mobile in some interesting and new ways. 
A couple of other quick things. As everybody knows, we were added to the S&P 500; we're very delighted to have been added there. Along the way, we were able to raise 2.1 billion for general corporate purposes, future investments and acquisitions. If you look in the history, for example at the AOL deal, where we ended up with a great opportunity to invest $1 billion, those opportunities come along. If they come along, we now have sufficient cash to be able to take advantage of them if they make sense. Indeed, that one did. So what you are seeing as a result of our strategy is value for end users and value for shareholders. We're excited for that, for obvious reasons. 
Three process comments for you. As everybody knows, we have a seasonality in our business. We have talked about this every year. It's been true for the six or seven years the Company has been around. It's more and more pronounced. Q2 and Q3 have slower revenue growth. This is basically because basically after Memorial Day, in the early part of June, traffic slows and doesn't really pick up until mid-August or so. So it the latter part of Q2 and the early part of Q3. And we are, of course, going to continue to invest during this period. 
We also -- of course, there's been a lot of debate about this -- are going to continue to not give forward guidance, as per our long-term policy. We are working on greater transparency for what we do, and we're going to continue to experiment with new ways that work with you and other important stakeholders in our community. 
We are, for example, planning to have some more informal Q&A sessions over the next year as we can arrange them. We're also going to try to shorten our comments today so we can have even more time for Q&A. Please give us your feedback about how this works and what is the right balance. We do want to do this the right way. So with that, I'd be delighted to turn this over to George. 
George Reyes
Thanks, Eric. As Eric suggested, we are very pleased with our Q1 results, which again demonstrate the strength of our business model. We continue to execute on both the top line and the bottom line, as we rapidly scale and make careful and measured investments in our business. Revenue growth was very healthy, increasing 79% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. We saw strong performance in many of our verticals and across many geographies, as well as substantial growth in our advertiser base. 
To highlight a few verticals that did very well in North America, the retail, technology and finance verticals all increased as a percentage of revenues since Q1 of '05. We're also very happy with the continued growth in our Google site revenues, which were up 97% over Q1 of '05. We also benefited from favorable traffic trends during Q1, as well as continued gains in monetization. 
Our network business also performed well. AdSense revenues grew 59% year-over-year, and were also correlated with increased traffic and gains in monetization. New publishers participating in the AdSense for Content program were significant in driving revenue growth and the AdSense referrals program we launched in Q4 is supporting this growth in our publisher base. We also strengthened and renewed relationships with several search partners, and are pushing forward with international expansion of the AdSense program. 
Now, let me turn to international results. We were very pleased with the performance of our international operations. Revenues from our international business were $936 million or 42% of our total revenues, up from 38% in Q4. Like last year in Q1, international revenues jumped as a percentage of revenues relative to Q4. 
In terms of foreign exchange, rate changes had an immaterial impact on our quarter-over-quarter international revenue growth. However, had foreign exchange rates remained constant from Q1 of '05 through Q1 of '06, our international revenues this quarter would have been $65 million higher. 
Let's take a bit of a geographic tour through revenues now. Revenues from the UK were $343 million or 15% of revenue, up from 14% in Q4. In the UK, France, the Netherlands and the Nordic region all exhibited particular strength in both traffic and monetization. The UK also benefited from an expected rebound in the travel and finance verticals in Q1. 
We're also continuing to see returns on our investments in local sales offices around the world. For instance, since opening local offices in Sweden, Norway and Denmark over the last 18 months, we have seen tremendous growth in monetization in the Nordic region. This growth is largely driven by the sales and marketing activities of these local offices. 
Let's now move onto the P&L highlights for the quarter. Revenue less traffic acquisition or net revenue was $1.5 billion, with TAC of $723 million or 32% of advertising revenues. Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center costs, operational expenses including depreciation expense as well as credit card processing charges, increased to $181 million or roughly 8% of revenues. Other cost of revenues in Q1 also included $2 million in stock-based compensation. 
Let me now turn to operating expenses, which in aggregate totaled $607 million this quarter. Operating expenses other than cost of revenues included $284 million in head count related and facilities expenses; $112 million in stock-based compensation; and $50 million in advertising and promotional expenses, of which $25 million was related to distribution deals. Also included was a charge of $30 million related to our estimate of plaintiffs' attorneys' fees we expect to pay to settle the Lane's Gifts class-action suit, which we have excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
Please keep in mind that stock-based compensation is now included in each of the operating expense line items, as well as in other cost of revenues. We have excluded the stock-based compensation portion of each of these line items from our non-GAAP results. 
For the full year, we now expect stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to April 1st of 2006 to be roughly $370 million. This does not include expenses to be recognized over the remainder of the year related to employee stock awards that are granted after April 1st or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted going forward. 
Turning to profitability, non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes stock-based compensation and estimated plaintiffs' attorneys' fees related to the class-action suit, was very strong at $887 million, with non-GAAP operating margins of 39%. You should continue to expect potential for compression in net and operating margins as we go forward and invest in the business. 
Our total cash position remained strong at $8.4 billion as of March 31st, with net cash from operating activities of $825 million or 36% of gross revenue. Our quarter end cash balance does not reflect the proceeds of $2.1 billion from our recent offering that closed in early April, and does not reflect the $1 billion investment in AOL, as it too closed in Q2. 
To clarify the share count calculation, our quarter-end share count does not include the 5.3 million shares we issued in the offering. This share count increase will be incremental to the 1% to 1.5% dilution we expect from employee stock awards. 
On the CapEx front, we continue to invest aggressively in our global infrastructure, which we believe is one of our most important competitive advantages. In Q1, CapEx was $345 million. We expect that CapEx growth rate in 2006 will be substantially greater than the revenue growth rate for the year. We expect the majority of investments to be focused on IT infrastructure, including servers, networking equipment and data centers, as well as real estate and campus facilities. 
So, to close, we are extremely pleased with the results we have been able to achieve this quarter. Now, I'll turn it over to Larry. 
Larry Page
Thank you, George. We had a great quarter with respect to our products, due to the hard work of all of our teams, and I am very excited about that. Our focus remains on providing the best user experience. The first quarter, we reached an all-time low on search spam and an all-time high on search quality. We provided more comprehensive and faster index. Structured data was integrated from Google Base into our main search. 
We also introduced several innovative new client applications to make Google functionality easier to reach from the desktop. Google Desktop 3 enables search across multiple computers and sharing of content through the sidebar. The Google Toolbar 4 beta allows users to build custom buttons to run queries directly on any website, create online bookmarks and receive queries directly on any website, and also feeds directly from their toolbar. 
We also made Toolbar 2.0 for Firefox available in the first quarter. Google Pack makes it easy for users to get essential software in just a few clicks, and aims to make it as easy as just using software on the Web. Just recently, we released Google Calendar, a Web-based application that helps people organize their busy lives and allows websites and groups to share and publicize information. 
We also introduced several early-release applications that push the bounds of browser capability. Now, with Google Finance, you can drag stock-based graphs around just like you can with Google Maps, you can move the maps around. Those graphs are even labeled with relevant news. It is really a lot of fun to use. 
Page Creator is a free and easy to use browser-based tool for creating and hosting attractive Web pages. We integrated chat into Gmail, which was a first in terms of offering users a seamless communication experience in the browser. 
Lastly, in terms of meeting the needs of our business customers, we introduced three new Google Mini search appliances with capacities and price points designed to meet the needs and budgets of a wide range of businesses. We got a lot done and continue to work very hard on our products. And I would like to turn the call over to Sergey. 
Sergey Brin
Thanks, Larry. The first quarter of 2006 saw a significant amount of activity in opportunistic acquisitions, global expansion of our presence and notable additions to our leadership team. Our commitment to enhance our products and services via acquisition of unique and ground-breaking technologies continued in the first quarter. 
The purchase of dMarc Broadcasting allows us to extend targeted and measurable advertising to radio by directly connecting advertisers to radio stations through dMarc's automated advertising platform. We also acquired Upstartle, maker of Writely, the Web word processor that helps people access, edit and share their documents from any computer on the Internet via their browser. 
In a step toward achieving our vision of mirroring the real world with a realistic virtual world where users can see and interact with all of the world's geographic information, we acquired @Last Software, creators of the personal 3-D authoring tool, SketchUp. 
In the first quarter, we renewed our partnerships with EarthLink, Comcast, NTT, Nextag and [Tungsung] and signed new deals Sony Ericsson, Vodafone, SingTel, WashingtonPost.com and Clear Channel. And of course, we finalize the extension of our partnership with AOL and are very pleased to broaden and deepen our relationship with them. 
As part of our effort to get closer to our users, customers and top engineering talent, in the first quarter we expanded our presence on a global basis. We opened R&D centers in Moscow, Trondheim, Denmark, Tel Aviv and Taipei. In addition, we opened offices in Mumbai and Delhi, and announced plans to open an office in Tempe, Arizona on the campus of Arizona State University. 
Finally, I was very pleased that we were able to hire Dr. Larry Brilliant as Executive Director of our philanthropic efforts known as Google.org. Larry is a renowned physician, technologist and specialist in international health, who is uniquely suited to lead our efforts to tackle the gravest of the world's problems in the areas of global poverty, health, energy and the environment. Eric, back to you. 
 Eric Schmidt
Thank you very, very much, Sergey. As a sort of a wrap-up, my personal view on all of this is that Google is now the world's fastest innovator at scale, and that the 70-20-10 model and the 20% time that we have talked about for a long time, combined with a broad strategy and excellent business model, is providing the raw material for an increased pace of innovation. The number of products and markets that we offer is increasing the scale, as we are just at the beginning of the Internet revolution, this bodes very well for our future and the future as a whole. 
We continue to invest in technology, capital and business deals to further our relatively simple goal of organizing all the world's information. This quest is not a short-term one, and we expect strong continued growth in innovation in the space for very long time to come. 
As life online with Google becomes more and more commonplace, we should see increasing benefits to everyone including, of course, our shareholders. And that's great news. So with that, thank you very much. 
We are going to be joined in our Q&A session with Jonathan Rosenberg, who is the Senior Vice President of Products. 
Question-and-Answer Session

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Safa Rashtchy, Piper Jaffray. 
Safa Rashtchy - Piper Jaffray 
Good afternoon, everyone. Congratulations on another great quarter. A couple of quick questions. As you all noted, you have been significantly expanding your product lines well beyond Search, of course, to a number of applications. But also on the advertising, you have embarked on providing advertising on a CPM basis, and then a graphical basis. 
Can you give us a sense of the revenues that you are generating from these areas and/or what you would expect over the next 12 months or so from these new initiatives? In particular, maybe a subset of that you could expand on is, what do you expect from Google Base, as well as the broader advertising network that you are working on? Thanks. 
 Eric Schmidt
Safa, thank you very much for that question. It is correct that we are investing in these new advertising sources; you highlighted a number of them. We expect them to be a significant component of our revenue in the future. Today, they are not. They are growing from relatively small bases. 
The most successful new revenue sources that we get are where we take the existing ad network and apply it to something new, like AdSense for Content. Some of these even newer things like the CPM ads are still in largely a beta test mode. Jonathan, do you want to add your perspective? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure. With respect to the CPM ads, we're definitely seen a lot of progress, particularly with some of the large brand advertisers with site targeting. We have also added some capabilities there to do some demographic-based targeting efforts, and they have the option there on our AdSense network of using a variety of these graphical ad techniques. 
The main customers who seem to be having the most success with this tend to be in the entertainment business. I've seen lots of examples of companies such as Paramount and a number of other movie studios; I think Fox did a great campaign with the Fantastic Four. So I think we're just getting started there. 
I think the real challenge is in the auction. It's hard to come up with ways for those graphically oriented ads to trump the traditional word and text-based ads in the auction, simply because of the relative probability that they are going to be clicked on versus a number of good small text-based ads. No one has really conquered the economics there to get more of the graphical stuff moving aggressively.

Our next question comes from Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley. 
Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley
Thanks. Eric, you talked about your mobile transcoder, and this may be a strange question to have at the beginning of the call, but could you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape there? It seems like this provides you with a big competitive advantage in what could be a very, very large market. 
When you think about it at a high level, the way Google Search kind of transformed the way people use the Internet and sort of reignited growth in the Internet, do you think that the products and services that you are offering in the mobile market that will allow people to get content easily, more effectively, in the right format for the user interface that's there could do something similar in the mobile market in the next 12 to 18 to 24 months? 
 Eric Schmidt
Well, of course, this is why we did the transcoder. It makes a lot of sense to try to get all of that information that is out there automatically and, in fact, dynamically translated into a format that will work on your phone. There are multiple formats that are available on phones. There's an older phone called WAP technology, and there is a newer technology called XHTML, and there are others coming. 
It is strategic to us to make sure that all the content is available on all the phones. Indeed, we have entered these partnerships. The notion of a transcoder is not a new one, we just think we have a better one than anybody else. 
Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley
Should we expect to see more partnerships announced in the coming months? 
 Eric Schmidt
Absolutely. 
Mary Meeker - Morgan Stanley
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Imran Khan, JPMorgan. 
Imran Khan - JPMorgan
Eric, you talked at the beginning about UK market share and the US and across the world, and I was wondering, in one of your conference calls, one of your competitors said they have been seeing consistent query volume growth of 15% to 20% in the US market. Can you just confirm on this call, are you getting query volume at a range in the US market of faster that, or have you seen any deceleration in the query volume growth? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I think all I can really say is that I see the same external data that you guys do, and obviously we have our own internal data that we don't actually share. What we can see is that the external data seems to us to be directionally correct. So it appears that we are gaining market share in virtually all markets, and that is consistent with the external trends that have been publicly stated. 
Imran Khan - JPMorgan
Actually, I think Yahoo disclosed that they grew the query volume 15% to 20% on the call, so it's actually coming from the Company. So I was wondering if you guys can give some range, maybe for the first time, or additional ones like Yahoo! on query volume growth you are seeing? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I appreciate your interest. I cannot narrow down the range specifically. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney, Citigroup. 
Mark Mahaney - Citigroup
Thank you very much. Maybe I would like to ask about one market where you may not be gaining share, and that's the China market. Do you think you're gaining share in queries there? I guess the third-party data probably doesn't indicate that. I know it has been a major emphasis of yours recently. Are there new initiatives we should look for out of that market? 
 Eric Schmidt
Having just returned from China, I think the market is up for grabs. Most of the surveys indicate that we are not in the number one position, we're in the number two position, and roughly holding and/or maybe gaining share in a small amount. Part of the reason that we're investing so heavily in China is because we think that the now 110 million people online in China, and soon to be many hundreds more than in the United States, will ultimately be big consumers of Google information. 
In order to do that, we felt that the most expeditious thing is to, in fact, have an R&D center; in addition, obviously, to having a presence in the country and working on connectivity and those sorts of things. The quality of the technical talent that's available in China is just phenomenal. 
So in the short term, you'll see the formation of the R&D center, which we have announced. Those engineers will be improving query performance, services and in fact new products for the Chinese market. We believe that the sum of those will materially change the dynamics in the Chinese market.

Our next question comes from Christa Quarles, Thomas Weisel Partners. 
Christa Quarles - Thomas Weisel Partners
I was wondering if you could discuss your philosophical approach to being a destination site, versus a place where people kind of figure out where they want to go and then go there. Obviously, you launched Finance, you have Video. Are you in a position where you eventually would think about paying for content, or would it be better to kind of go the vertical search route, for example? 
Larry Page
I'll try to address that. We really don't think about it that way, and we are trying hard, all of our teams are working hard to find user needs that are not being met at all. I think there is a natural tendency to keep about the Internet and computing space as largely discovered; we're going to develop products that are similar to what other people have. But if you had asked me to predict five years ago, even when we were fairly far along as a Company, the kinds of things that we would be doing now, I wouldn't have been able to predict very well. Many of the things that you see of the Internet with respect to advertising or other areas have been very innovative and have not been predictable. 
So in general, we're looking for areas where we can innovate, where we can meet really substantial user needs. Those are general areas that are not being addressed well at all now. So I don't think we think about it that way in terms of destination. We're looking for places where we have leverage that will matter to our users and will be a good business for us, and we expect to be rapidly expanding that innovation.

Our next question comes from Ben Schachter, UBS. 
Ben Schachter - UBS
Hi guys. Congratulations on an outstanding quarter. Just a quick question on the experiment that you are running with Dell right now. I was wondering if you could talk about how large that may or may not be, how the accounting works for that and how is it different from deals you may have done in the past with other OEMs. 
Also a question on the pay-per-call model . Understanding that you have negotiated some things with AOL and that AOL, arguably, with their partner, Ingenio, has been a leader in that. I was wondering if you're going to be working with them on a pay-per-call, or if you think you are going to go out on your own and be more a competitor with them? 
Sergey Brin
I wanted to discuss our Dell experiments, and then someone else may take the pay-per-call question. On the Dell side, we're continually working with computer manufacturers to make Google more quickly accessible to end users. With the Dell experiments that have been underway for a while, we actually have probably pushed larger amounts of software than some of the others, including Desktop as well as Toolbar and the start page and things like that. 
I'm excited that we continue to try things like that. I believe that computer users should have as great an experience out of the box with a new PC as possible, and so we're trying to bring that great software to manufacturers, so just right out of the box you have Google in a way that works and works well. The Google Pack is also another vehicle for allowing new computer users as well as old to have a good out-off-the-box experience by making it easy to download some of the key components that you might need. 
So that's the basic strategy. I don't have any relationship or business deals to report. The accounting George might speak to, if he has anything to add to that. I will leave it at that. Jonathan. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
On the click-to-call, I think you are basically referring to just some very early alpha testing that we have been doing with this product that lets you speak directly to an advertiser that you can find through the results on a Google search page. Its basically free; you do it over the phone. We've really only just started on trying to test this. 
I think it's a very exciting model, because it's a model where you are much closer to consummating the transaction when you actually engage in the activity and go to the advertiser. So advertisers are very excited about it, because it's actually a model where you're delivering a customer that has very high odds of engaging in a transaction. 
In terms of working with our partners, as is the case with all of our products, these are going to be opportunities for our partners to make a choice with respect to whether or not they want to work with us. We've had great success with AOL; they have been one of our biggest long-time partners. We will generally offer this kind of functionality to a partner, and then let them decide what they want to do from a product perspective on their own.

Our next question comes from Robert Peck, Bear Stearns. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Hi guys. Great quarter. I just have a question on spending and how you look at it going forward. First of all, are you able to give any more detail to us, even geography-based or more specific, on the CapEx? 
Following up on the previous question, are you able to give us a little more detail around the economics of the Dell deal? 
Lastly, would Google be interested in any of the wireless Spectrum coming up this summer? 
George Reyes
I'll take the first part of it. As we have discussed the topic of CapEx over the last two to three years, what we believe and have believed for a long time is that these investments will pay off very handsomely, and it will further strengthen sort of the competencies that we have. So we're going to continue to invest at a rate that is substantially higher than what we did last year, and we believe it will pay back in spades. 
Larry Page
I'll address the wireless piece. We have started some experiments in San Francisco and Mountain View to provide Wi-Fi access. In general, we're interested in any way we can provide better, more transparent access to the Internet to our users, thinking that will be good for our business and generally a good thing. We have not announced any plans with regards to Spectrum or anything like that. But like I said, we are generally interested in improving access to the Internet. 
Robert Peck - Bear Stearns
Any economic details on the Dell deal? 
 Eric Schmidt
Let's just say that in the trial, both companies have done well. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs. 
Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. We hear from advertisers about unspent budgets quite a bit, and we have heard a number thrown around in the advertising community of about $1 billion for Google that people put into the system and don't get spent. Could you talk a little bit about initiatives to unlock that value? I know you are not going to quantify that number, but do you think there is a lot of potential there in different formats and new verticals, et cetera? 
Second question, George, housekeeping. By my math, I can get into EBITDA of close to $1 billion, a little over $1 billion. There has been some other numbers thrown around the Street that are below that. I just want to clarify that that's correct, which would imply a pretty healthy EBITDA margin of about 65.4%. Could you give us any sense on margins throughout the year? 
The CapEx number is significantly higher, it creates a range that is pretty wide. I was just wondering if you could give us any sense for what is the downside of margins? Could it be below 64 or not? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Let me start with the budget issues and sort of just generally some of issues with respect to head room and opportunities for garnering more of those dollars from our advertisers. The first issue with respect to the budget is a little bit of a legacy of the way the systems are architected. Advertisers have a strong incentive to put in a budget that is substantially greater than their actual spend. They do that, of course, because the gross margin on each of the clicks that they receiving from us are positive, and the rate of change in terms of that margin on incremental clicks is pretty close to constant, because it's such a large system. So what the advertisers tend to do is put in an artificially high budget that ensures that, on any given day, their campaigns continue to run. 
Now, that said, there are lots of opportunities for us to spend larger fractions of that budget. Certainly, one is to expand the scope of the network and the reach of our sites. But probably the most significant opportunity is just improving the statistical algorithms associated with how we target ads. So anything that we do to ensure that we serve a better ad to one of those advertisers is going to get us more budget and more budget from whichever advertiser is the best advertiser. 
So I think, if you run a lot of searches, you'll see actually that although we have the strongest monetization systems in the industry, the ads are actually still pretty primitive. There are a large number of ways, we believe, to continue to target the ads a lot better. 
George Reyes
The answer to your question, EBITDA was about $1 billion. 
Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
How about the margin portion of that question relative to CapEx? 
George Reyes
The margin portion relative to CapEx? Can you --? 
Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Your CapEx guidance basically says that it's going to increase significantly faster than revenue. As we think about CapEx throughout this year, that gives us a ballpark to range CapEx. We don't know what you're going to spend outside of CapEx, and so we can forecast revenue pretty well, or think we can forecast revenue pretty well by all these third-party data sources and our own channel checks, but we can't forecast what you are going to spend. Are you willing to give us something on CapEx or give us something on other spending? 
George Reyes
Anthony, what you're asking for sounds like a little bit of forward guidance that I don't really want to get into. 
Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs
Basically, I was basically looking for other expenses, other than CapEx, to try to get to an EBITDA margin. 
 Eric Schmidt
Why don't we take that one off-line. Sergey, do you want to answer the other part of it? 
Sergey Brin
Yes, I wanted to speak briefly about this issue of budgets. In fact, we see the greater opportunity is not the people who are under budgets, but rather the people who are budget-limited currently. Because for those advertisers, all we need to do is get them to increase their budget limits, which oftentimes they just set it a long time ago, or they didn't really think about it. There are a lot of weird reasons. They will right away start spending more. So we actually view the budget-limited advertisers as a great opportunity.

Our next question comes from Youssef Squali, Jefferies. 
Youssef Squali - Jefferies
Can you theoretically, fully participate in the growth of branded advertising or display ad revenues, which arguably is seeing a nice acceleration, over the next several years, by only really leveraging your network, not the Google properties? So historically you have said that you will not have these display ads on your Google properties. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I may let Larry follow-up philosophically on this, because he probably is the one with the strongest vision in terms of how we will monetize our own site. I think there are lots of opportunities, particularly outside Search, where some of the branded efforts might make some sense, and we would certainly be open to looking at branding efforts in some of those areas. 
Within Search, the dynamic tends to be that the value and the tell, with respect to what the user is interested in is so great that there is not a lot of value in trying to substitute a branded-based advertisement for a search-based advertisement, given the amount the advertiser is willing to pay. 
But in terms of other properties I think there is certainly lots of opportunities, potentially, in the social networking space and potentially in other products that we have yet developed. So certainly I would not rule it out. I'll let Larry cover his philosophical issues here. 
Larry Page
I don't think we have any philosophical issues with respect to branded advertising on our own sites. Certainly, anything we gave to network sites we would be happy to use ourselves in the proper places. Search itself, as Jonathan mentioned, is maybe not the optimal place for that. But we have many, many other properties now, including Video and Orkut and e-mail and many other types of things, too, that would we would be open to. We should note, too, that the network that we have is very, very large. And that's part of our strength as a business. 
Youssef Squali - Jefferies
On the Wi-Fi initiative, you have a deal going on with EarthLink. That deal, from what we understand, has a low-end portion that is ad supported and then a premium. Do you have a preference for what a model in Wi-Fi environment should be? Do you have a preference for it being ad-supported, or you are encouraged by bringing an AOL or an EarthLink to do the access part and you just kind of take advantage of the traffic and try to monetize the traffic? 
Larry Page
I think we created quite a stir when we released the proposal to do ad-supported Wi-Fi in San Francisco with EarthLink. I'm excited about the possibilities there. We said before that it's a trial and an experiment for us. We are doing it at a relatively small scale. I think we and everybody else in the world would be very excited to see good Internet access that was free and ad-supported and profitable. That would be tremendous for our business, and in fact for the Internet as a whole.

Our next question comes from Jordan Rohan, RBC Capital Markets. 
Jordan Rohan - RBC Capital Markets
I have gathered some data points recently which I hoped you would be able to comment on. Related to the Japanese market, where I have heard that the market share for Google is actually on the rise, that you guys could end up with 25% search query volume share by the end of the year, up from 15% at the end of '05. 
While I don't expect you to have any idea, really, whether the entire market is growing, can you talk about your relative presence in Japan, whether you think you may be gaining share? Also, is Japan today a material percentage of revenue, however you want to define that, for Google? 
 Eric Schmidt
In the Japanese market our primary competitor is Yahoo Japan, and of course Google, there is some evidence indicates that we are gaining share. Japan is absolutely a material contributor in revenue to Google. I would encourage you not to look at any specific country but rather to try to look at whole regions. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Rowen, Prudential. 
Mark Rowen - Prudential
I know you don't give out click-through rates and pricing, but could you just give us a sense on trends for that? You talked about presenting better ads, and I assume if you're actually delivering more targeted ads and putting the right ad in front of the right person at the right time that you are going to get higher click-through rates. Are you in fact seeing that, or are click-through rates starting to fall over time? 
Second, there's been a lot of talk recently about social network search. I was wondering if you could talk about how you view that. Are you working on anything in that area? Do you think that, for certain types of search, that that's a better form of search than algorithmic? 
Larry Page
Maybe I will address the first part of your question and leave the second for someone else. The click-through rates and CPCs and things like that , I was just in a meeting yesterday where we were reviewing some changes we were thinking about. We had a good hour-and-a-half discussion about all those factors with regards to the experiments we were running. 
Each one of those things was very nuanced and actually, depending on the experiments we were running, apt to move in an arbitrary way, up or down. It's going change in some way, based on what we were trying to accomplish with regards to the quality or revenue or the way the particular algorithms work or not, or what the advertiser behavior is likely will be. 
I've said this in the past, that I would really caution the analyst community here to not be too fixated on any of those particular metrics, because I know that we make changes all the time that cause them to go up or down. It's very easy to make more money by reducing CPCs, by running more ads and so on. So we look very carefully at the revenue we are generating per query, and that's a combination of click-through and cost-per-click. 
But those things are all heavily inter-related, and so we haven't released any stats on those. It's very, very complicated. 
Mark Rowen - Prudential
So you would not agree that over the long-term, if you are delivering more targeted ads in front of people at the right time, that click-through rates should go up? 
Larry Page
It depends on the UI that we run on, it depends on how good the search results are, it depends on what countries you are talking about. There's a lot of parameters there. 
Mark Rowen - Prudential
And on the social networking? 
Sergey Brin
I think social networking is a really exciting new area. Don't forget that we have a very successful social networking site of Orkut that's obviously much better known in Brazil than in the US. It's been very successful. I think it's interesting, from a broader perspective than just Search, but in terms of communication, in terms of meeting people, in terms of lots of other aspects than just Search. 
From a Search point of view, we like to be really comprehensive. I think that our main Search can include the information that is also found on the social networks. That is really the way that we see it. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I just wanted to add a little bit on the click-through rate question. Larry's point about the dynamics of the whole equation being complicated are well-taken. And if you think about it in the [limit], if you assume that the percentage of queries that people run that are commercial versus non-commercial isn't going to change, but our ad systems are going to get much, much better at targeting them, then the dynamic that you would see ultimately would be coverage could be a lot lower because, if we were smart enough, we would not serve ads on many of the pages where an ad isn't particularly appropriate. 
On the other hand, on the subset of pages that are really commercial, we would probably be serving very, very good ads and you would see very, very high click-through rates. So if you are just looking at that one RPM equation and trying to look at each independent variable and ask whether or not it's going to go up and down, you are going to be somewhat misled, because the system has additional effects in terms of the relationship between those variables and the relative improvements in the system.

Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth, Lehman Brothers. 
Doug Anmuth - Lehman Brothers
Eric, you mentioned earlier in the call about the switch to Best Practice Funding in the UK and that you had a 100% signup rate there. Can you give us a sense of how much incremental revenue that generated during the quarter, and then also a sense of how your relationships are with the agencies in the UK? And I think you mentioned that they are benefiting from the switch as well. I was hoping you could provide some color on that. 
 Eric Schmidt
We have modeled some impact on revenue positive, but that's not why we did it. We did it because it's a better way to leverage the skills and the talents of the largest agencies. What happened was, over the last few years, we had invented a model which was much more direct engagement with agencies in the United States. We brought in some new and very dynamic leadership in Europe that thought this was an opportunity that would work well in Europe, given our strong market share and strong monetization, and indeed, it has done so. 
We began to preview this in October, and Q1 was the first full quarter. All the indications are that it's extremely successful and that those benefits will accrue for eternity. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Heath Terry, Credit Suisse. 
Heath Terry - Credit Suisse
I'm just wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Google Local, to what extent, as you have ramped up the advertising within the channel, what kind of a reaction you are getting from consumers, what monetization looks like relative to the core Search product, and what the strategy is going to be for that as you try and add advertisers? 
Jonathan Rosenberg
I'll start initially, and we'll see if Larry and Sergey have something to add. As Eric mentioned, Local is definitely becoming increasingly important in terms of advertising revenue. There's a little bit of confusion about the local business ads product that we recently introduced, and where we are in terms of product functionality. 
You could already target, prior to this launch regionally, basically by defining a radius around a single business. That's the mechanism via which the majority of the local advertising is coming. It's a little bit complicated to optimize a campaign. Many of the advertisers who are advertising locally still have one set of keywords in one campaign which they are doing locally, and then another campaign which they are doing nationally to try to pull in additional customers. 
Then, what we most recently introduced was what we call local business ads. And basically what that is is the capability within our Local product to enable these direct on-the-map ads with the custom map pin and the company image on the map in a balloon. So those are the kind of things that you would see if, for example, you run a search on Barnes & Noble, New York. You'll see the actual pins locating the stores; you can hover over them and then get more information. 
I think in the very long run, the thing that's going to fundamentally change here is when in addition you're actually linking inventory availability into local systems, you are really going to see a significant increase there. But we are already seeing that it has become a material component of our business. So with that, I'll see if Sergey or Larry has anything to add. 
 Eric Schmidt
Let's move then to the next question. 
Operator
Jim Friedland. 
 Jim Friedland - SG Cowen
A question regarding your new partners. You mentioned Washington Post and Sony and some others. Are these new partners that did not have pre-existing partners, or are you gaining incremental share from your competitors? And the second part of that question is, have you lost any meaningful search partners, large search partners, in the past six months? 
Sergey Brin
This is mostly adding new partners. The Washington Post that you mentioned, it was actually an interesting case where they used to be a partner a while ago, and for a while they weren't, and now we have regained them. So I don't know how you count that one. But for the most part, we are adding partners. And I can't think of any significant losses; that's pretty rare. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Marianne Wolk, Susquehanna. 
Marianne Wolk - Susquehanna
I had two questions. One question would be, you have all of these new opportunities we are looking at, such as Local and the content side advertising and even the enterprise business, which looked like it had a very good quarter. Could you rank these in terms of largest to smallest? 
As Google Base becomes more and more popular, is there any chance you would consider moving to more of a revenue-sharing model versus a click-through model? Can you talk to your philosophy on that? 
 Eric Schmidt
We run the Company with the 70-20-10 model, and we don't typically score the opportunity for each of the innovative groups. We'd rather see how fast they can grow. So each of the ones that you named, Local and Content and so forth, are all doing well because they are prioritized right and have the right amount of resources, consistent with our operating philosophy. 
It's hard for us to make a prediction as to which one will grow faster than the other. They are all big markets, and there's always something that slows them down. You know, we need to get a deal done, or we need to get some content, or we need to get more tools to the advertisers and that's what we work on. So there's no simple way of prioritizing one against the other; they are all consistent with our strategy. 
With respect to the question on Google Base and rev share, Jonathan, you have thought about that a little bit. 
Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure. Basically, the intent of Base is to improve the quality and breadth of Google Search and our results by collecting a lot more information, and also a much wider diversity of content. It obviously gives content owners and producers a better way to submit the information if it's not a web page or it's not online. The way we have been describing it so far is you get free distribution; it's flexible, you can upload anything, you can do it through any file format, you can create custom item types and attributes, you can define the metadata as it relates to your content. I don't think that we have really planned on monetizing this as something like a traditional classified product. The goal is really more to improve search. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Bill Morrison, JMP Securities. 
Bill Morrison - JMP Securities
It looked like your employee growth in the quarter was healthy, north of 1,000 employee additions. Revenue per employee was down, it looks by our analysis, for the second quarter. I was wondering if you could comment on whether we should expect that trend -- well, first of all, I guess, do you plan to continue to accelerate hiring into the second and third quarters, beyond the 1,000 you hired this quarter? Secondly, should we expect revenue per employee to continue to trend down? That's it. Thanks. 
George Reyes
If you have been watching us over the last few quarters, we have in fact been growing, hiring pretty aggressively, which, as I've said the bunch of times, is very consistent with the agenda that we have before us, which is not only a lot of broad expansion domestically but also a lot of expansion internationally. So we're going to continue on that aggressive path, and we're going to do that sort of in a way where we balance the revenue side of the equation with the cost side. But make no mistake about it, we really are in investment mode at this point. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Martin Pyykkonen, Hoefer & Arnett. 
Martin Pyykkonen - Hoefer & Arnett
Eric, first on pricing, we have talked about this a lot. You have been pretty clear and adamant that we in the investment community really don't have the granular detail to understand the underlying trends here and the headroom that you might have. But a question along those lines and at the risk of oversimplifying this, which admittedly is the case; if you would look at the kind of smart advertiser that has been in this for a while versus the newer advertiser coming in, and particularly in some of the newer markets, I'm curious if you are getting more of the pricing leverage from the newer, less experienced advertisers, or if it's fairly well-balanced between the savvy and the less experienced advertiser. 
Then on the tax rate. You had mentioned 30% for the full year '06 was a good range for modeling. Obviously, you had some benefit with the lower tax rate this quarter. I'm just curious what kind of quarterly variations you might foresee, or how we might model that going forward for the remaining three quarters of the year. 
Larry Page
I'll take the first half of the question. I think there's actually a bunch of factors going on there. One thing to note, when we enter new markets, there's generally not a lot of competition for advertising. So the initial prices are quite low, given that we sell through an auction. This is actually a great way for us to get people excited about our model, and to get a lot of people into the system, and for those early trendsetters to get rewarded for trying out something new and taking some risk. 
In those new markets, I think probably the prices are pretty low initially, and then increase over time as people really understand that they are getting sales through this thing. 
That's the other part of this, is that we are seeing much wider adoption of tools to track conversions, with people actually buying. We love that. We think that's a great thing for our business. It helps our advertisers understand precisely which keywords to advertise on, how much they make from each one and what customers are really doing. Obviously, if somebody buys something, they know how much money they made and it becomes a very well-calculated kind of expense, where they know that they are making money on it. 
So I think, as our markets get more experienced, there is a lot more use of tools for tracking this information. We have also released some of those tools to really help our advertisers do that. 
George Reyes
Back to your question on taxes and the tax rate, last year we projected a full rate of 30% for the year. We're pretty much on that same track now; that's our view. I think what we all collectively need to understand is that taxation is subject to discrete items that can come up from quarter to quarter. So our best assessment of the rate at this point in time is 30% for the year, and it came a little bit lower than that this quarter. 
Martin Pyykkonen - Hoefer & Arnett
Are there any major discretionary items that we could track in terms of assessing that as you kind of go forward through the year? 
George Reyes
I doubt it, because it is such a technical area, where we are continually assessing it each and every quarter and setting the rate appropriately on that basis. 
 Eric Schmidt
Let's get a couple more quick questions, and then we'll have to finish up, operator. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post, Merrill Lynch. 
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
You mentioned seasonality over the summer. Outside of growing internationally, is there any reason to believe that could be different year-over-year? 
Then, a strategic question. You have a great asset with your search traffic, do you see integrating that into your verticals like Finance and Base? What is the opportunity there? 
 Eric Schmidt
Let me answer that. On the seasonality, the seasonality we're seeing is the same we see every year, and I'm sure that that seasonality would be true as long as the Internet is primarily predominant in the Northern Hemisphere. The summer is, of course, we are in the summer here. So I don't see a change in the next few years; we're going to have this structure for the foreseeable future. 
In terms of the great traffic that we have for Search, we don't think of it that way. We think more about taking wonderful properties like Base and introducing their content and structure into overall Search, so it's the inverse of what most people think. We want to have fewer verticals and better integration with better signals and better quality. 
Operator
Our final question comes from Derek Brown, Pacific Growth Equities. 
Derek Brown - Pacific Growth Equities
A quick question -- I'm actually surprised it hasn't been asked yet. But it relates to TAC. It is something that has obviously been trending down over time, and I'm wondering if there's a rationale behind that. Is that something that you would anticipate seeing going forward? 
George Reyes
Historically here, going back a year, year and a half, we haven't seen all that much pressure on TAC. Where you do see discrete and explicit tension points with TAC is when you get large, hotly-contested deals. Of course, in those instances, you would end up paying more and bidding up TAC. But generally speaking, we have a very thriving and vibrant publisher network; they have good economics, we have good economics, and the model works. 
 Eric Schmidt
I went to thank everybody for spending an hour with us. Again, let us know how this works, whether we're communicating effectively. We very much thank you for coming, of course, to the next financial analyst meeting; many of you came in February. We look forward to talking to you before this, and we'll also be looking forward to talking to you at our next conference call, which will be in July. So thank you very much.

Well thanks very much, Kim. I’d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. I’ll begin with some introductory comments and then turn it over to George for some more detail on our financial results. After George goes through the numbers, Larry and Sergey will comment on the quarter and some of the initiatives that we have underway. And after that we’ll have Omid and Jonathan join us as they did last quarter, to take your questions.
I’d like to remind everybody that our policy is not to give any forward guidance and we are going to continue that policy for the indefinite future.
We are very pleased with these results and hope that you’ve had a chance to look at the press release already. We had very strong growth in our core search and our core ad business. 22% quarter over quarter growth and 86% topline revenue growth since Q4 ’04. We saw and in fact delivered expected and in fact delivered seasonal strength in both traffic and monetization, all very good indicators for the future.
Our focus at Google is on the end-user experience and frankly more and more time that people spend online will be spent using Google online in one way or another. And the products and improvements that we make are geared toward enhancing user quality and really changing the way people use this sort of amazing thing that is the internet. This approach, the end-user experience, is the core to our culture and to our recruiting efforts and the way we manage the company. We see very tremendous opportunity for growth at this point. We have new, innovative products that deliver the value to our technology into different channels. It looks, based on our analysis, that the international markets are highly under penetrated, with tremendous forward growth, as we build out our operations there, and we’ll talk about that some more.
The expansion of our advertising network continues apace, continues to be very, very strong. But perhaps most important, we believe the rate of innovation will increase in 2006 as we continue to bring the most talented minds into Google and our unique innovation model delivers amazing new products.
So we take a long term view of the business and we’re going to invest for the long term and make some really big bets. So with that, let me turn it over to George to take you through the exact numbers.
George Reyes, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Eric. First, I will go through 4th Quarter results in detail, and then summarize our annual results. But before we get started, as a reminder, we report both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP earnings exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, in-process research and development and a contribution to the Google Foundation of $90 million. In our earnings release, we have included reconciliations to GAAP for all of the non-GAAP measures, including EPS, net income, operating income, operating margins, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. So let’s jump in and get started.
As Eric mentioned, we achieved strong revenue growth during the 4th Quarter. Revenue grew to $1.919 billion, an increase of 22% over the 3rd quarter and an increase of 86% year over year. GAAP operating income in the 4th Quarter was $570 million. This compares to GAAP operating income of $529 million in the 3rd Quarter, an increase of 8%.
Non-GAAP operating income for the 4th Quarter was $718 million. This compares to $596 million in the 3rd Quarter an increase of 20% sequentially. GAAP net income for the 4th Quarter was $372 million, compared to $381 million in the 3rd Quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the 4th Quarter was $469 million, compared to $437 in the 3rd Quarter. GAAP earnings per share for the 4th Quarter were $1.22 on 305 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $1.32 for the 3rd Quarter on 290 million diluted shares outstanding.
Non-GAAP earnings per share for the 4th Quarter were a $1.54 on 305 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $1.51 for the 3rd quarter of 2005, on 290 million diluted shares outstanding.
Non-GAAP operating incomes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS are all pro-forma measures, computed net of certain material items, namely stock-based compensation, in-process research and development charges, and the contribution to the Google Foundation of $90 million made in the 4th quarter of 2005. In Q4, the charge related to stock-based compensation was $58 million, compared to $46 million in Q3. In-process research and development charges were immaterial in the quarter, compared to $21million in the 3rd quarter. GAAP tax benefits related to stock-based compensation charges and the contribution to the Google foundation have been excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. The tax benefit related to stock based comp was $14 million in the 4th quarter and $11million in the 3rd quarter. And the tax benefit related to the contribution to the Google foundation in the 4th quarter was $37 million.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $658 million for Q4, compared to $647 million in Q3. Now, I’ll go into some more details on revenue and expenses.
As I mentioned a moment ago, total revenue grew 22% sequentially, and 86% year over year to $1.919 billion, demonstrating the continued success of our advertising solutions. Revenue growth was driven by expected seasonal gains in both traffic and monetization. Both Google.com and the Google network experienced strong growth during the quarter. During Q4, the mix in revenue continued to shift toward Google.com sites, as revenues from our Google sites increased 24% sequentially to a record $1.098 billion. While revenue from the Google network, third party sites that display ads provided by Google, increased 18% over Q3 to $799 million. Revenue from our own sites represented 57% of total revenue in the 4th quarter as compared to 56% in Q3. And revenue from the Google network represented 42% of total revenue, down from 43% in Q3.
We’re very pleased with the growth in both AdSense for search and AdSense for content, as our search partners experienced strong 4th quarter performance and we continue to add publishers to our network, extending the reach of our advertising platform.
This quarter, revenue from international operations was $735 million, an increase of 18% over the prior quarter. International operations contributed 38% of total revenue compared to 39% in Q3 and 35% in Q4 of ’04. The UK contributed 14% of total revenues as compared to 15% of total revenues in the third quarter. The decrease in international revenue, in UK revenue as a percentage of total revenue, is attributable to foreign exchange and to seasonal trends, both of which I will explain further.
We experienced an unfavorable impact to revenues due to the strength of the dollar relative to foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, the Pound and the Yen. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from Q3 through Q4, our revenues would have been $12 million or roughly .6% higher. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from 2004 through 2005, our revenues would have been $40 million or 2.1% higher.
In addition, we saw stronger seasonal trends in the US than in the international business in Q4 with weaker December spending in certain verticals in the UK. Last year the effect of this trend was offset by favorable impact from foreign exchange and from the addition of AOL Europe in Q4 of 2004. We continue to see good progress in our international operations. Overall, our international business had a strong quarter, with very healthy growth in Europe, Asia, central and South America. We continue to see international expansion as a key area of opportunity and investment. We remain under-penetrated in several markets and are focusing our efforts on building out our infrastructure and bringing more localized products to these markets.
So in summary, we are very pleased with the strong revenue growth in the quarter and for the year.
Turning now to costs and expenses. As all of you know by now, at Google, cost of revenue is comprised mainly of traffic acquisition costs or TAC, expenses association with the operation of our data centers, credit card processing charges and amortized expenses associated with purchased and licensed technologies.
In the 4th quarter, cost of revenue increased to $775 million, up from $654 in the 3rd quarter, but decreased as a percentage of revenue to 40.4%, from 41.4% in the previous quarter, primarily due to a reduction in TAC as a percentage of revenue, which I’ll discuss next.
TAC, or the revenue share we pay to our partners, increased to $629 million in Q4, from $530 million in Q3. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenue decreased from 34% in Q3 of 2005 to 33% in Q4. This decrease is related primarily to revenue mix, as revenue from Google.com sites increased relative to revenue from the Google network.
In Q4 of 2005 R&D spending increased to $157 million from $152 million in Q3. R&D spending as a percentage of revenue declined to 8% from 10% in the prior quarter. The decrease in R&D as a percentage of revenues is due primarily to a reduction in IPR&D charges in connection with acquisitions, as well as with the seasonality of engineering hiring in the month of December. You should fully expect to see growth in this expense line as the pace of innovation at Google accelerates.
Turning to the sales and marketing front…sales and marketing in Q4 was up $155 million, an increase of 47% from $105 in Q3. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing increased from 7% in Q3 to 8% in Q4. This growth is attributed primarily to the development of global marketing programs such as our toolbar distribution deals, expansion of our global sales force and investments in Asia and Latin America.
G&A increase to $114 million in Q4 from $92 million in Q3, an increase of 23%. On a percentage of revenue bases, G&A stayed flat with the prior quarter at 5.9%.
Turning to stock-based compensation, stock-based comp charges grew in Q4 to $58 million from $46 million in the previous quarter, primarily related to Google stock units issued in Q4 and those that were issue previously. Our non-GAAP results are net of these charges, after the related tax effect. Stock based compensation in 2006 will be significantly greater than it was in 2005 as a result of our adoption of 123R, effective January 1, 2006, which requires the expensing of all stock-based compensation. We currently anticipate the dilution related to all equity grants will be in the 1-1.5% range in 2006.
As we discussed on our last call during the 4th quarter, we contribute $90 million to the Google Foundation. This was a non-recourse, non-refundable donation and was recorded as an expense in Q4. We do not expect to make further donations to the foundation for the foreseeable future. We do however expect to make equity and other investments in for-profit enterprises that aim to alleviate poverty, improve the environment and achieve other socially or economically progressive objectives. We expect these investments to be made primarily in cash and to be valued at approximately $175 million over the next 3 years.
Turning to operating margins, our non-GAAP operating margin in the 4th quarter was 37% of revenues; we’re down slightly from the prior quarter as revenue growth and a more favorable revenue mix were than offset by significant investments in all areas of our business. Our GAAP operating margin declined primarily as a result of a $90 million donation to the Google Foundation in Q4.
Now I’ll turn to taxes. Our effective tax rate for Q4 increased to 41.8% this quarter and to 31.6% for the year, above expectations of approximately 30% for the year. The amount of tax expense we recognized in any particular quarter is driven by our estimates for the year. And as we’ve said in the past, our estimates for the year are sensitive to the mix of earnings in the US and overseas. These estimates are complex and 2005 was the first year we realized any reduction to our effective tax rate as a result of profits earned overseas under our international structure. At the end of the year, we must true up the tax provision for the year, which could and in the case of Q4, did have a disproportionate impact on the 4th quarter. In calculating our true up for the year, the proportion of expenses allocated to international operations was greater than we expected. Primarily as a result of this a greater percentage of our profits were taxed at a higher domestic tax rate, which resulted in a greater effective tax rate, compared to our expectations. Keeping in mind the complexity of projecting tax rates, we expect our effective tax rate for 2006 to be approximately 30%.
Looking at liquidity, net cash provided by operating activities for Q4 totaled $658 million as compared to $647 for Q3. Free cash flow, another non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. This quarter we generated $413 in free cash flow, as compared to $354 in Q2 and $309 in Q4 or ’04. Our capital expenditures in the quarter were $245 million, primarily reflecting purchases of servers and networking equipment as well as acquisitions of additional office space.
Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, IPR&D and stock-based compensation, increased 21% to $814 million or 43% of revenue in Q4, up from $672 million or 43% of revenue in Q3.
Our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances were just over $8 billion at 12/31 of this past year, up from $7.6 billion at the end of last quarter. Days sales outstanding, or DSOs increased to 33 days from 31 days last quarter. This reflects the growth of our international business where credit terms tend to be longer as well as the extended credit to certain customers in the US.
Now, I’ll summarize our annual results.
Full year 2005 revenues increased 93% to $6.1 billion. International revenue accounted for 39% of total revenue, up from 34% in 2004. GAAP operating income was $2 billion, compared to 2004 GAAP operating income of $640 million, which was impacted by a charge related to a legal settlement in 2004. 
 On a GAAP basis, that income nearly quadrupled, reaching $1.5 billion, compared to $399 million in 2004.
Total Cap-ex spending for the year was $838 million.
Looking forward, we will continue to invest heavily in our global infrastructure, including servers, networking equipment, and data centers, with a smaller proportion on real estate investments. On a worldwide basis, we grew to 5,680 full-time employees as of December 31, 2005, as compared with 4,989 employees as of September 30, 2005 and 3,021 employees as of December 31, 2004.
So, to summarize, we are very pleased with our Q4 results. As we have previously emphasized, we are investing aggressively in our business and scaling rapidly to pursue enormous opportunities for long term growth. We will fuel innovation through deliberate and appropriate investments in R&D and in our core infrastructure as well as through acquisitions. We believe these investments are critical to achieving our mission and to maintaining our competitive advantage.
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Larry Page for more details.
Larry Page, Founder and President, Products
Thank you George. We spend a lot of time at Google focusing on our users. We’re always finding new ways to serve their interests better. I want to talk about three areas where we’ve been targeting our innovation. We see the users want more personalized products that they can tailor to their needs. We see that they’re always looking to find more information easily. And we recognize that users are seeking new ways to get information using devices other than their PCs.
During this past quarter, we introduced several new products and services that we think will help meet these needs. On personalization, we’re learning that as people use Google more, they want more targeted results. So we’re bringing information to our users in more personalized ways. For example, our personalized search feature takes previous search history into account when presenting results and is now available in 12 languages. Users can set up Google News to get stories based on their preferences through the Google accounts login. We also launched 12 new local editions of Google News, expanding the reach of news information tailored to users.
More recently, we announced Google Personalized Home for mobile devices. A new service that enables users access to their personalized Google home page on their mobile phones and PDAs.
And just this week, we announced a beta version of Google Toolbar that offers the ability to store bookmarks and access them from anywhere and other new features.
To provide people with more information, we worked with more partners to add new content to our services. Google book search and a related library project, provide new ways for users to locate material that previously couldn’t be searched online. Google Base collects even more information about a wider diversity of new types of searchable content. The way we organize and present the content allows us to give users more targeted search results. We broadened the scope of Google Video so that users can search across the wide range of videos from many new content producers. We’ve already announced deals with CBS, the NBA, Charlie Rose and others, and expect to announce more in the coming quarter.
Finally, we are also giving our users more ways to access information. Last quarter, we released versions of both Gmail and Google Local for mobile devices. Anyone with a Gmail account can now easily get messages from their mobile phone. With Google Local now integrated with maps, users can access business listings, maps, driving directions and more on their mobile devices. RIM recently announced the release of Google Talk on their Blackberry hand held devices. We introduced Google personalized home for mobile, covering both seams that I discussed previously.
In addition, we signed agreements with Motorola and T-Mobile to provide search services to millions of mobile phone users. We believe that mobile applications are essential in bringing the internet experience to users in countries where mobile usage outpaces broadband.
Overall, we’re continuing to make progress towards our mission to organize the world’s information and to make it universally accessible and useful. Looking to 2006, we expect o launch more products that bring more information and more content to our users. Now I’ll turn the call over to Sergey.
Sergey Brin, Founder and President Technology
Thank you Larry. First I’d like to share some thoughts on our advertising business. At Google, we have built a user-centric business, meaning that ad-serving is based not only on when and where the advertiser wants an ad to be shown, but more importantly, when and where the user wants to receive the information. We have encouraged our advertisers to use an always-on approach to their campaigns, rather than a more traditional flight-based approach. And we are now really reaping the benefits of this approach.
Changes we have made within our sales organization are enabling us to address advertisers’ needs in a more targeted way. The 4th quarter was the first full quarter with a vertically organized sales force in addition to a growing inside sales channel. And, we have been reaching out to both Fortune 500 customers and medium-sized businesses more effectively. Larger companies are now including interactive advertising as significantly and increasing components of their overall marketing budgets. They are making more investments in technology and in partner relationships to help them to scale and to better measure ROI.
Ford Motor Company has successfully partner with Google to execute integrated lead-generation and branding campaigns for years. During the quarter, Ford was the first automotive advertiser to run a major placement within our site targeting program. This campaign generated awareness around the launch of the new Ford Explorer, as well as promoted Ford’s sponsorship of the Road to Kona Ironman competition.
Alongside our larger advertisers, we continue to see many smaller, less well-known advertisers building their businesses through AdWords, as we help them drive qualified leads to their site and grow into larger companies. Our platform creates a level playing field that allows small and medium businesses to take advantage of the same features, such as site-specific targeting, regional targeting and conversion tracking to ensure their message reaches their intended audience.
We are also providing more flexibility for all of our advertisers. During the quarter, we introduced AdSense on-site advertisers sign-up, where publishers can sign up new advertisers directly from their websites, and AdWords separate content bidding, which enables advertisers to place separate bids for ads that run on content sites, giving advertisers more choice and more control over their ad placement.
As always, we are focused on improving the quality of the ads that we serve and will continue to make product improvements that better match ads to queries and to content.
In Q4 we renewed several important AdSense partnerships including InfoSpace, Terra Networks and Span end result, Key Online and ECBig Globe, Business.com, WebMD and C-Net. We also signed new deals with PBS, Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam Webster. And per our announcement in December, we have also extended our relationship with AOL.
We continue to develop innovative ways to extend our competencies to other media channels. In addition to our continued testing of outplacement and print publications, this month we entered into an agreement to acquire DMARC, a digital solutions provider connecting advertisers directly to radio stations, through an automated media platform. We plan to integrate our AdWords platform with the DMARC solution in order to provide another distribution channel for our advertisers and ultimately to increase overall spend with Google.
So, switching gears before wrapping up, I’d like to talk about some of the great progress we have made toward building out the business internationally.
In November, we opened offices in Brazil and Mexico and increased the size of sales and operations teams in regions where we still have large opportunities to increase our penetration such as in China, Japan and India. We continue to rollout localized versions of our products in new languages, which is essential if we are to meet the needs of different users and different markets. This quarter, we rolled-out sixteen languages for Google analytics, 12 languages for Google personalized home page and 15 languages for Google desktop, among many others. As we look forward, we will intensify our efforts to build out our infrastructure overseas and to develop products that are tailored to individual markets. We will continue to develop tools for our advertisers to help them better understand and improve their ROI. And ultimately, our goal is innovation. We hope to create new and better ways for advertisers to connect with their customers wherever they may be. Eric, over to you.
Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer
Thanks very much Sergey. So we had a strong Q4, full of product enhancements, many partnerships, ongoing improvements to our platform and all very consistent with the relentless focus that we have on user experience and the integrity of our search results.
We see the revenue and profitability expectations of the quarter and we’re scaling this business rapidly and we’re investing for the long term. This is a distribution scale business of, in my opinion, enormous proportions focusing on end-users, billions of them. When we build a product we need to think in terms of the billions of users that are in so many different countries. We need to create access points for all devices so they can get this information and we’re focused on executing our business as scale with the lowest cost for capital and the highest performance delivered in the industry.
From my perspective, this remains a unique and historic opportunity. Putting more data on the server and information on every kind of device: mobile phones, moving information from personal computer to personal computer, personal computer to mobile, without having to figure out things like what files server, all of those kinds of things are something that people have been clamoring for for a long time. We’re not yet finished getting all the information into Google into the hands of end-users around the world.
So looking at 2006, lots of investment in better search tools, more personalization, much more content, a lot more focus on the advertisers. We’re already seeing strong monetization from our existing advertisers and many more advertisers are joining. We get feedback from our advertiser cycle. Feedback in the cycle causes us to provide better monetization per query, more services and more ways of making money as this market grows and as our reach grows.
We have more advertising clients with brands. And those advertising clients with brands are learning how to use our technology to solve their business problems. We’re also applying this to different mediums. Leveraging technology in other innovative ways; new user access points, mobile phones, consumer electronics, television, radio with the DMARC acquisition, print, click to call, all either launched or under development here at Google.
From a corporate perspective, we are growing our talented employee base. Great technical people, great business leaders all around the world. We’ve added Shirley Tillman and Anne Mather two outstanding individuals, to our board.
Google is still completely committed to the fundamental mission of getting all of the world’s information easily accessible and useful. We’re going to do very, very well here. So with that, we look very much forward to spending some more time with you at this year’s analyst day on March 2nd and Kim, is it time to go to question?
Yes, please.
 
Question-and-Answer-Session
Operator
Thank you, if you’d like to ask a question, please press *1 on your telephone at this time. Again, that’s *1 if you’d like to ask a question. If you are using a speaker phone, please be sure that your mute function is turned off to allow that signal to reach our equipment.
We’ll take our first question from Yousef Squalie at Jeffries.
Yousef Squalie 
Thank you very much, two quick questions. First, George, if I were to normalize for the differential in your tax rate, am I correct in basically seeing that there is a 24, 25 cent differential which basically puts you back at $1.78? And second, Sergey, what are your plans regarding the offering of rich media display formats to your network of publishers? Can you just talk about time-in? I understand you guys are doing a small beta right now. Should we expect revenue share to be similar to that of the Ad Network program?
Thanks a lot.
George Reyes, Chief Financial Officer
This is George, as you’re correctly starting to figure out here, really most of the mess was related to the tax impact and that’s sort of the gap to consensus. I think that’s the question you were asking.
Yousef Squalie
Correct, and Sergey?
Sergey Brin, Founder and President Technology
Yes, this is Sergey. We have increasingly offered more and different kinds of ways to put advertisements on line. We’ve been somewhat conservative. As you know it took us a while to allow image advertising within AdSense, but we allow it now. And we have now increased the number of different formats and sizes that we offer. I expect that we will continue to do so, but we will want to be cautious that the formats we allow have restrictions that mean that the websites that run AdSense always have a peaceful presentation. We wouldn’t want really outrageously flashy things to just distract everyone from the website and for that website as a result to not want to participate in AdSense. That said, we’re definitely open to lots of new great media formats from interactive and obviously the offline ones of print and radio that I already mentioned.
Operator We’ll go next to Mark Mahaney at Citigroup
Mark Mahaney. 
Thank you, two questions. As you lok at the other types of medium, print and radio, is it push or pull that’s taking you there? Do you have existing clients who are coming to you saying we’d love to see you come up with advertising solutions for those media or are those just areas you find interesting in the meat of innovation? And just real quickly, any more color on the UK vertical weakness you mentioned George?
Thank you.
George Reyes, Chief Financial Officer
Why don’t we add Omid and Jonathan to the conversation since they’re on the line. Omid, do you want to start with advertising?
Omid Kordestani Senior Vice President, global sales and business development
Sure, thanks, yes. I think it’s really a combination. We’re really trying to figure out how to reintegrate the advertising solutions with more of the successful model we have of measurability. For example, we’re very impressed by DMARC and the solutions they’ve provided already with the bringing of a level of automation that is very similar to our model. Now, the ROI models are going to be very different and we’re going to look for working with our existing customer bases to expand into these new formats and mediums. The other is really, frankly, again as I mentioned we’ve organized our sales organization to be really much more focused industry by industry and figure out how, again, to best serve the needs of the Fortune companies, the major accounts and what we’re finding is that all of them have a lot of interest in figuring out how to bring more measurability and how to expand and integrate more solutions across different formats.
Jonathan Rosenberg, Vice President, Product Management
Hi Mark, this is Jonathan. Just building on Omid’s answer real quickly and I’ll cover the UK, I think that it really is our ability to offer a unified platform for all media to our advertisers and extend the accountability of online to other media that you’re really going to see. So it is both a push and a pull model, but it’s really getting to that more unified platform that I think is critical.
The UK answer is a little bit nuanced. You tend to see monetization in the UK is doing fabulously well, overall. We tend to see a little bit of the reverse kind of seasonality in the UK relative to the United States, over the holidays. There are also some specific issues just related to how the calendar worked and number of relatively high monetization days that slightly adversely impacted that. But it’s mostly just the reverse Christmas trend that you see in the UK, which is simply a cultural and vacation-related issue.
Operator our next question comes from Douglas Enmuth at Lehman Brothers.
Douglas Enmuth
Thank you. I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more on the sales and marketing line which came in certainly higher than we were expecting. You talked about obviously growing out the sales force. Can you sort of give us some guidance in terms of how far along you are in this process in building up the sales force and also how much of a factor that was versus some of the other things you mentioned around toolbar distribution and expansion in Asia and Latin America? Thank you.
George Reyes, Chief Financial Officer
Hi, this is George Reyes. So, I think the best way to address this question is, over the course of the last year and all of these earnings calls that we’ve had, I think we’ve made it very clear that we are focused on growing our business and international expansion, in particular. So I think the way you should look at the increase in the sales and marketing line is just as a logical extension of that. We think the opportunity ahead of us, particularly in international markets I just exceptional and what you’re seeing is the investments that need to be made to sort of harvest that opportunity.
Operator Our next question comes from Jordan Rohan at RBC Capital Markets.
Jordan Rohan
Thanks. I’m curious and maybe this ties into Doug’s question a little bit as well, as you look forward in 2006, do you see the same kind of incremental growth in operating expenditure? I think in the quarter you did $75 million higher operating expenditure than you did in 3Q. Is that the type of pace or growth in total operating expenditure that you can envision?
George Reyes, Chief Financial Officer
Yes. As you guys know by now we don’t give explicit guidance, but let me try and sort of replay my tape one more time. So we think the opportunity ahead of us, especially in international markets, is exceptional. So we’re going to continue to invest at these rates. And that’s sort of the agenda here.
Operator Our next question comes from Scott Kessler at Standard and Poor’s
Scott Kessler
Thanks very much. The growth in the Google network websites was a little bit lower on a relative basis than I had expected, and I was wondering if you could provide any details related to that? Thanks a lot.
Omid Kordestani Senior Vice President, global sales and business development
Hi, this is Omid. We actually have had very good success in renewing contracts and signing new ones as Sergey mentioned. It just has to do with the fact that some of the biggest partnerships are in long term contracts with us and that there weren’t any really new significant, major amounts of traffic both in terms of content or search that we added to the network. From their end, we’re experiencing nice growth in traffic, seasonality was nice in the commerce sector and we also are continuing to focus on partnering.
Scott Kessler
Are a number of these contracts that you speak of up for consideration in 2006? Is the pipeline looking like you want it to look like? I think people are kind of wondering why the revenues were the way they were for that particular area.
Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer
This is Eric. In general, the contracts are multi-year contracts and so they’re pretty locked in from a business model perspective. The benefits that we offer advertisers for improved RPM, that is literally revenue growth per query per advertiser, and so forth, are new to both Google.com and the partner network. So what you’re really seeing is that the aggregate growth of the partner network is growing somewhat slower than the total growth of Google.com, which is also mirrored in some of the market share analysis that people are showing. And, it’s hard for us to predict whether that will continue, but it has been a trend for some time. We are reasonably indifferent to which category gets the growth, although if Google.com grows, there’s more of a private contribution, because we keep 100% of that rather than doing a rev share with the partners in the TAC relation.
Operator We’ll take our next question from Mark May at Needham and Company.
Mark May
Thanks for taking my question. It has to do with new consumer products. Some of the new products that you launched last year have received mixed reviews. For instance, Google video. I’m wondering if you could sort of grade yourself in terms of how well you think those initial launches were; if it were less than a 10 or a 9, what might you do different to improve the user experience there? And then just secondly, we haven’t heard much about Founder Awards in a few quarters. I’m wondering do you have any updates? Recent awards? Or is that a reflection of innovation within the company? Thanks.
Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer
Maybe we could have a founders comment on that then Jonathan add as well. I was going to comment that we tend to ship products very early and in Beta, precisely so that we can experiment with them. Larry or Sergey?
Larry Page, Founder and President, Products
We have always done that. In fact we launched AdWords like that and it took us a while to get to the model that we have now. We actually had…we didn’t have pay-per-click initially. This is sort of how Google has always worked in that we love getting things out really early, we love experimenting with them, we love having a huge pace of innovation. And so I’m actually very, very happy with our process. We’re launching a lot of different things that people are really interested in. The teams that are doing those are learning a tremendous amount. Video has actually gone through three iterations already. And, it has been tremendously successful. We’ve gotten huge numbers of videos on there. We just recently launched the paid videos and we expect to do a lot more along those lines. And I couldn’t be happier with our progress there. Sergey will talk a little bit about Founders Awards.
Sergey Brin, Founder and President Technology
Yeah, this is Sergey. If you think over the past year, we’ve certainly had a number of very exciting, successful products that we are already pleased with and that have already repped great rewards for our company. It takes a little while, sometimes, to really assess that value and be able to appropriately reward those employees. But we do have one cycle of founders awards; it should happen in the next few weeks. There have just been a number of other important things we’ve had to attend to that have probably delayed that a bit more than we should have. And, we look forward to really giving those out because I think that I’m not going to pre-announce them now on the earnings call, but I think they’re well-deserved and most people will be very happy. With regard to some of the less mature products, I think we’re going to give them some time to see where they take us and really evaluate their overall benefits to Google as a company and to our end users.
Operator Our next question comes from Heath Terry at Credit Suisse.
Heath Terry
Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about gmail. Specifically, what kind of traction you’re seeing there both in end users as well as monetization and what you think as that product starts to mature, how you think on a relative basis monetization within that offering will look versus the monetization in your core search business.
Sergey Brin, Founder and President Technology
This is Sergey. We are still in the phase of gmail where we are focusing on innovating on the features, the experience. We are spending an increasing proportion, but still a relatively small proportion of our engineering resources, focusing on the monetization. We are relatively comfortable that over time, once we decide to make that push, much as we did in search only after a couple of years of focusing almost exclusively only on the search experience. We are comfortable that that’s a very valuable service and will have some significant financial benefits.
Jonathan Rosenberg, Vice President, Product Management
Hi, this is Jonathan, just building on what Sergey said. We measure user satisfaction very, very carefully. So that’s one set of feedback which we get. We also did extend the signups to several additional countries. I think there were 8 or 9 countries that we extended to in December. And we also launched some new features towards the end of Q4. We added some simply things that people had been asking for in the satisfaction studies, just vacation auto-responder and RSS speeds and contact groups and viewing as HTML. So we made a lot of improvements in mail and in other media forms. But over time I think what you’re going to see is that we’re going to have different inputs into the out systems that are better and more appropriately tailored for the different product set. And gmail will certainly benefit from that as we crack the monetization code there.
Operator Our next question comes from Troy Maston at William Blair and Company.
Troy Maston
Thank you. Question along the lines of the international business. You referred to it as under penetrated. I’m curious if you were referring to market share or penetration of search on the internet or monetization or perhaps all of the above? If it is monetization, can you give perspective on how effective you view your monetization in the non-US markets versus the US markets?
Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer
This is Eric. Maybe Omid and I can answer that together. I said it because when I look at where those markets are compared to the US, I see them a couple of years behind the level of penetration and monetization in the US. In some cases, it’s simply because advertising online is new. In some cases, it’s because we were later on a relative basis of entering the market. And in some cases, it’s because e-commerce is still a new and fast-growing thing. If you look at the difference between the United States and Western Europe, for example, it took a couple of years for the model in the US to really take off in Western Europe. Our Western European revenue growth in the last year has been nothing short of amazing. And in fact, it looks like international growth, ignoring quarterly fluctuations, will continue to outpace US growth for the foreseeable future. So, we have made a decision to invest in many of the international markets to bring them up to the scale of the more mature markets of the United States and Western Europe. Omid?
Omid Kordestani Senior Vice President, global sales and business development
Thank you Eric. Yes, as Eric mentioned, this is a big focus for us and it was highlighted by several operations that got established last quarter from Brazil to Mexico, Poland, Israel, the European regions and Turkey. And I think the good news for the sector is that what we’re seeing is that our ROI based measurable form of advertising is really working everywhere with similar levels of interest. It’s just the maturity levels. So, even in a market like Japan, for example, that is pretty well established, the level of targeting and direct work with the clients is not at the level of sophistication that we see here in the States or the Western Europe. So we’re very busy taking the learnings and the best practices from the US and extending it where it makes sense. And then establishing our operations so that we can be on the ground and localize the products properly, localize our operations and attract talent from both a technical standpoint and business operations.
Operator Our next question is from Lauren Fein at Merrill Lynch.
Lauren Fein
Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones please. I’m just wondering if you could update us in any fashion on how the AOL relationship is going in terms of just putting your heads together and figuring out how you’re going to leverage the content and your ad sales force. And then secondly if you can give us any quantitative update on how you’re doing in penetrating the Fortune 500. It seems like you’ve had some more visible success and with the vertical channels selling, it would seem that that would have helped as well. And for any quantitative or qualitative update there would be great.
Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer
I think Omid and I will answer this as well. This is Eric again. On the Time Warner/AOL deal, we were very, very excited to announce a five year plus extension to that. It’s a very deep partnership involving quite a bit of video and other kinds of display advertising as well as much more integration with the sales force. That deal is signed and we’re busy planning all sorts of collaborations between the two companies. What I like about it is that it’s an extension of what we’re doing already, so there’s no hiccup, no negative, no hurt. Because of timing we were able to take advantage of it. So there’s a new set of products flowing through. We’re spending a lot more time with the sales force training them on the new technologies and we’re beginning to plan for some of the new display and video collaborations that we contemplated in our deal. Omid?
Omid Kordestani Senior Vice President, global sales and business development
Thanks Eric. We’re really focusing the organization to monetize the business at many levels. We’re offering the Fortune 5000 companies the ways to customize site targeting, for a really good examples of those you may have heard about were advertising in the entertainment industry like Paramount, very successful in using site-targeting to drive awareness of their movies before a movie launch. Drive sales of DVDs once it’s released Chrysler, Honda, StarCom, MediaVest have been also some of the other major users of site-targeting. So what we’re really doing is trying to again understand best how the Fortune companies are trying to work with us and share with them industry-specific, vertical specific knowledge of performance and really use all the tools and all the products we have available today and the new ones that we’re bringing forth to just improve their experience and bring measurability and reach of greater audience. And, we’re very pleased with our progress.
Operator We’ll take our next question from Anthony Noto at Goldman Sachs.
Anthony Noto
Thank you very much. I wanted to focus on three areas that I think you’re generating very little revenue from if not any at all. Specifically, Google images, Google local and then Google China. I think the last time we touched base you were generating zero revenue in Google China, is that still the case? Second part of the question, Google images, I believe you’re not generating any revenue from. It’s a sizeable vertical with 25 million unique visitors according to Media Metrix. What’s the methodology and when do you think you will monetize that and what are some of the considerations for getting factors? And lastly, Google local, there seems to be a lot of innovation going on in Google local and click to call would be a great way to monetize that. If you could comment, thanks.
Jonathan Rosenberg, Vice President, Product Management
This is Jonathan. We’ve certainly done some experiments that you may have seen with images and it certainly is an area where we have significant traffic. What we typically see there is that people who go to images are looking for just that, they’re looking for an image. So, one of the things that we’re still trying to crack the code on there is what is the right context sensitive ads to offer? Certainly you can sell them images, but Google already supplies a reasonable number of images that are free. So, although we have a lot of traffic there, it has not yet proven itself to be one of the more monetizable vehicles, although there are certainly experiments that we’re going to continue on there. As far as the question related to China, I don’t know the specific answer on that. Omid may well know the answer on that.
Omid Kordestani Senior Vice President, global sales and business development
Hi, yes. China, we actually have both the online availability, the advertising available so that customers can come through the online channel and we’re very actively building our direct capabilities there. One of the things that’s important, obviously, is having all the right infrastructure on licensing available for us to be able to operate locally. So we’ve been very focused on just establishing ourselves. We’ve had great success actually in signing up resellers and the results from working with these resale appointments have been excellent, actually, in terms of a number of advertisers have actually joined our online program. And we’re looking forward to establishing direct relationships with both agencies and clients directly as our capabilities are getting built up.
Jonathan Rosenberg, Vice President, Product Management
And I’m sorry, I don’t think I answered your question on click to call, I mean, that’s obviously an exciting area and I think as we mentioned on the call last time, we’re testing the ability for users to speak directly to advertisers when they find them on a Google search results page. It’s free, they do it over the phone, they don’t have to dial an 800 number, we keep the number private and you know, what’s obviously exciting there is that you’re connecting somebody expeditiously and directly to a place where they’re reasonably likely to consummate a transaction. Whether it be a restaurant or an organization or a store. So, the monetization opportunity is obviously very significant.
Omid Kordestani Senior Vice President, global sales and business development
And to add to that on just the local front, as you mentioned, we believe that local is a very great opportunity. And, I think we’re going to…we have been experimenting, we’ll continue to experiment. We don’t want to rush to have the wrong advertising solution. But, we believe it’s such a fantastic opportunity that we’re investing a lot of effort to do it.
Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer
Let’s take a couple of more questions.
Operator Our next question comes from Robert Peck at Bear Sterns.
Robert Peck
Yeah, I just have two quick questions. One is, could you comment a little bit more on DMARC? And besides all the radio opportunity there, are there other opportunities that it provides, such as TV, video advertisement placement, pod casting advertising, etcetera. What opportunities does that technology provide? And number two, how should investors think about Google as a software and a hardware company? When we think about, particularly these transportable data centers, when we think about devices in the home, dub them Google Cubes or what have you, or even I believe the Linux system of Ubunto, how should we think about where Google’s going next and the opportunities in front of it?
Jonathan Rosenberg, Vice President, Product Management
I wanted to talk about DMARC, I don’t know about the second question. On DMARC, it is a very exciting opportunity. It took us a while to figure out that there was this possibility of the radio market, based on its structure, based on its technology, based on the existence of a company such as DMARC. And, we are, as you know, experimenting with print. We don’t know exactly how it will work. We are optimistic. I suspect that advertisers want greater access, better accountability, more unified framework for their ROI and so forth, I suspect there’s great demand for all those things. And, as a greater consequence, we can generate greater revenue for the publishers. But, this really requires a lot of testing and development and understanding of this specific market. So I can’t forecast the success of any of those but I have great optimism.
Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer
I would add on the DMARC side that this space is a vast space and so this acquisition lets us go in there with a very, very differentiated product and tied to our advertising system, should provide a significant growth in scale, globally. On your question about sort of hardware and software company aspects, you mentioned Ubunto, which is a Linux brand, we use it internally but we have no plans to distribute it outside of the company. There’s an awful lot of speculation about Google playing in those markets. The Google PC, those kinds of things. To me, most of those are people projecting the last one, not the next opportunity on us. And from my perspective, those are not very interesting business opportunities; they’re well covered in the market, we partner with many of the players and we would much prefer to deepen our partnership with them than to go into competition with them.
We are relentlessly focused on this new end-user experience, which is multi-platform and based on the internet and that’s where our future is. That’s where the growth is, that’s where the revenue and monetization is. And, as I mentioned earlier, it’s so large, it makes no sense to divert our resources to these other and somewhat smaller opportunities.
Operator The final question comes from Trina Choudry at JMP Securities. Miss Choudry, please go ahead. I’m hearing no response, would you like to take another question?
Yes, of course.
Operator We’ll take our final question from Mary Meeker at Morgan Stanley.
Mary Meeker
Thank you. If we compare the 3rd quarter sequential results with the 4th quarter results, I think you said on your last call your query growth was kind of flatish, I don’t want to put words in your mouth, so please correct me if need be. And the revenue growth was pretty powerful so the monetization increase sequentially in the September quarter was very high. In this quarter, you in your press release and on the call you talked about seasonal strength in traffic and also in monetization. Could you give us a little more color on the differences in the degree of incremental monetization you had in the 4th quarter versus the degree of incremental positive monetization you had in the 3rd quarter? Thanks.
Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer
This is Eric. We saw both strong user traffic in the December quarter as well as continued improvement in the monetization. I wouldn’t characterize them as being on the monetization side as being materially different than the rate of improvement that we saw in Q3. We are continuing to invest heavily in improvements in quality; those improvements in quality and many other enhancements that we offered in our product line, result in continuous improvement every quarter in monetization on a constant flow of traffic. In addition to that, traffic grew quite strongly, perhaps because of seasonality, perhaps because of gains in market share, perhaps because of all the new products, or perhaps because of a combination of all three. But we know that both are working and when both are working well, we see very, very strong resonant growth, which is of course wonderful.
What I’d like to do now since we’re run out of time is go ahead and wrap up by saying that to all of you first, thank you for taking the time to be on the call. We’re very, very pleased with our performance on every level. The financial, the pace of innovation, the growth, the quality of the leadership in the company, the positioning that we’re in today. This is a very exciting industry to be in and it’s getting increasingly more interesting every day. We’re very…we’re still very much in the early stages. I think in my view, making tremendous progress of realizing the long term vision that we’ve outlined over the last year or so, with you to organize the world’s information. And we’re tirelessly committed to delivering this value to our users and to our shareholders. We are innovating at scale and we’re seeing strong user growth and strong revenue growth. And again, you see that in our numbers, you see that in our comments. Life online through Google, information plus search plus advertising, making all of that seamless, is not just the Holy Grail for the company but it also provides tremendous operating efficiencies, revenue growth, and we believe all told very strong cash flow and profit growth. As an example, very, very large advertisers now see the ability to take large sets of businesses that they have and spread them across a pretty wide variety of products offered in many different markets through Google. The multiplicative effect, which you get by strong revenue growth, strong user growth, strong product line growth and many new advertisers is what is going to, currently we believe, continue to deliver very, very strong growth here in the company.
So thank you very much again to our users, our partners all of our employees, our shareholders. I’m very, very sure 2006 is going to be an exciting year for Google. So with that, thank you very much.

Operator
Thank You.  Ladies and Gentleman to ask a question at this time simply press “*” “1” on your touch tone telephone.  Once again that was “*” “1” for questions or comments that you may at this time.  We will take the first question from     Scott Kessler with SMP Equity.
Scott Kessler
Thank very much.  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your plans to provide free Wi-Fi access to the city of San Francisco.  What is the underlying business rational, do you plan on trying to do similar things in other areas of the country?  Thanks a lot.
Larry Page
Yeah, thank you for the question, this is Larry.  We are excited about expanding Internet access in general.  We think it is really good for our business as people have better access to internet they do more searches and they use our services more and so the San Francisco Wi-Fi is an experiment to see how we can provide some new services and also software as you mentioned localized software and things like that, in an environment where people have really good accesses to the internet.  But we have not announced plans to do anywhere else besides San Francisco yet.
Operator
The next question comes from Benjamin Schachter from UBS.
Ben Shafter
Hi guys. Congratulations on the quarter.  I am not going to ask about the quarter, I will let it speak for itself for now.  But, I want to talk about the big picture and discuss how you guys view alternate moneterization methods to the current pay-per-click model?  Statistically what you think about pay-per-crawl, pay-per-action model and how they may work within Google’s framework and do you have a timeframe in mind where you might introduce early tests in these methods and also potentially related to that, could you comment on reports that you have been testing direct feed from some potential classified ads partners and thoughts you might have on the usefulness of Google potentially acting as a classified ad aggregator? Thanks.
Larry Page
Thanks very much, Jonathan do you want to take it?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Hey Ben, I think that was a pretty extensive question I think I will defer to Omid on some of the pay-per-click and pay-per-crawl models because I haven’t been too much involved in that.  I think the main way for us is really trying to focus on opportunities for increasing monetization probably the biggest opportunity there.  I think you have seen us deal with the site targeting efforts and that‘s really grown substantially in this last quarter and basically what that does is, it lets advertisers choose ways to ad their ads and pay by CPM or impression based model.  Omid Kordestani, why don’t you take the pay-per-click component.
Omid Kordestani
As Jonathan said we are trying to really understand how best advertisers want to work with us.  So throughout this year we’ve done a lot of work with agencies and sales force to really understand how do we bring this accountability to media and we haven’t really announced any specific products in that area and just focused on finding the best way to bring the same kind of accountability we brought to CPC advertising, no current format but extended beyond that.
Operator
We will go next on Martin Pyykkonen Hoefer & Arnett Investment Bank
Martin Pyykkonen
Yeah, thanks.  Question on the AdWord versus AdSense mix.  Obviously the more of the AdWord mix improves _____ logic to spend more essentially on R&D and sales and marketing.  I am just curious on the mix, to what extent does the mix that you are driving or it’s natural evolution etc., because that will give you some flexibility kind going forward and then secondly the buzz that there is lot about the paid click per search going up to the significantly and I am just wondering in terms of your optimizing and working for advertisers, what you are doing in that space to the extent of how the _____ make for, other stuff in that area?
George Reyes
Yeah, this George, I will take over the mix question.  We have been through a couple of cycles on mix, early on it was a Google.com driven business and then we began in 2002 and 2003 to really build up the partner network.  And that of course drove TAC up and what we are seeing, now and it was rather perceptive this quarter is a very robust 20% growth in Google.com with relatively modest 7% growth in the partner network.  So, we’ve been through cycles on this both rich Goggle.com cycle and somewhat lean Google.com cycles and it all depends at the rate, really the driver is the rate at which the partner network is growing.
Jonathan
This is Jonathan, Just following up on our own monetization efforts.  Basically the way to understand the dynamics support driving most of that is you really just look at both ends of the advertising spectrum.  And I think what you will see is we are monetizing the business better at the global fortune 1,000 front, where we are coming up the lots of new product functionality that lets us reach customers again with site targeting and a lot of aggressive adds quality improving in work that we have been doing to make the add better targeted and more effective and increase that all the way.  And the other end of the spectrum and this is probably a significant component too.  If you look at the smaller advertisers in small business space, we are developing lots and lots of ways of making it much easier for them to come on to the network and advertise.  So, the growth is coming in terms of the number of the advertisers and the fact that we are giving them both tool at either end to monetize more effectively.
Operator
We will go next to Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.
Jeetil Patel
Great, thank you very much.  Couple of questions, how do you think about kind of extending your abilities to take existing advertising products and other services and bundling them together such as, if potentially a PPC and CPM based product model or may be advertising and other areas that are ancillary to advertising and lead generation?  And then secondly, you are half way there, with the performance-based model.  How do you think about, eventually looking to shift your advertising product, to may be a percentage of sale basis which is kind of seems like the most efficient model in terms of helping generate transactions for your advertisers?  Thank you.
Omid Kordestani
Hi this is Omid again, as we said earlier we’ve really looking at ways to bring this accountability and extend it to the directions you are talking about.  And then one example I can give is, the ways that we try to simplify for advertisers to in a bid basically one price and that has to have different kind of pricing models for the network, be it the content sites or the search sites and then we introduced technology called smart pricing, which allows us to kind of value traffic from different sites in different ways and we do that by considering conversion information.  So, built into the way the add system is working to the way the network is working today, we are continually looking for ways.  Again to make it simple, but bring it as close as possible to our ROI metrics that everyone is interested in.
Operator
Our next question will come from Mark Mahaney, Citigroup.
Mark Mahaney
Hi thank you.  You started off by talking about some success and I think may be recently with the fortune 500, could you say how you could quantify that, earlier in the year you had a number of your penetration almost the fortune 1,000 was that something particular that happened, I guess some new products but did they really accelerate the penetration and any update on what that level of penetration is? Thanks.
George Reyes
The biggest change that was done in the sales force had to do with verticalization, we actually organized our sales force into a set of vertical teams they call one or two levels higher than they were before. Omid do you want to describe that a little bit?
Omid Kordestani
Sure, one of the major initiatives that I am very proud of our organizations really executing out this year was across the board trying to leverage the best channel to serve our customers, so internally we call it, we like to work with our customers the way they like to work with us, so be it a third party agency or coming to us directly online or working with our direct sales force so.  What we’ve done is really made it very smooth for our customers and transition as many accounts to the best channels that our best setup serve them.  So, throughout the year as Eric mentioned, we have taken our field organizations and pushed them into an industry focus and have them both call and service accounts with attention to the industry, the metrics in that industry and again leverage all of our channels both within Google and our partners to service our customers the best way possible.
Jonathan Rosenberg
This is Jonathan just following up.  I think the really biggest component there is having along with the sales force changes moving into the brand budgets with the big fortune 500 customers and I think this is a big secular trend that’s benefiting Google and other online properties.  So, in addition to the new products that we have been launching, we are just seeing consumers spending more time online and there are many examples of, if you look at Paramount Pictures and others who are using multiple Google products with the launch of new movies like Hustle & Flow to spend more online across inventory that they want previously given access to.
Mark Mahaney
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question come from Marianne Wolk, Susquehanna Investment Bank.
Marianne Wolk
Thanks, on two quick questions.  First of all I was wonder if the smart pricing referred to would benefit Google’s network more than its partners, just trying to understand why you are growing so much faster then your partners.  Did the partner’s site have as many as the new _____ links and secondly can you talk about some of the efforts you are making in the enterprise area?  Thank you
Omid Kordestani
Sure this is Omid.  We believe actually as we look across the network, there are different characters as you are seeing, there are some site have a very commerce focus that do perform better than our own inventories.  So, Smart Pricing really is designed to for the most part to take and really put a discount in the areas where we see traffic that is just not converting as well as we expect.  And again this is an area where we are focused on improving with additional science and focus on ROI metrics.  In terms of the growth and the kind of mix in the quarter it really had to do with the fact that Google is continuing globally to gain shares in search, but a lot of our partners are doing as well.  So, it’s as George mentioned the metrics, the shift was more to their own properties, but in general I think across the board both our partner network contributed well and the performance of our products really enhanced the monitorization capability this last quarter.  In terms of the enterprise business, we are really again focused on similar to the other parts of our business, serve the customers the way they want to work with us.  We had a lot a focus on the government sales with our high end systems and search clusters, but the mini product itself is doing extremely well and a we have a lot of new customers both in the SMB market as well as in the kind of the larger deployments with government and major fortune companies.
Operator
We will go next Imran Khan of JP Morgan.
Imran Khan
Yes hi, its Imran Khan.  One question, can you talk a little bit about what is your motivation for adding a third link and how did that if impacted _____ rate or overall yield in terms of volume or monetization of this quarter?  Thanks.
Larry Page
This is Larry.  I think that’s a very good question.  You think sort of when, we add more advertiser links, we are sort of increasing revenue with the existing qualities or something like that.  What we really do though is we actually do more complex things.  So, we decide when to show the ads or not, and we can actually increase the quality and revenue.  So typically the changes we make we think are going to do that usually craft about our prediction.  But, I think you will see us make very many changes like that, we certainly would like to make very many changes like that in the future and we should typically have a pretty long list.  It’s hard for me to go on with the specifics without that, but you know generally we try to increase both quality and monetization, we make changes like that.
Operator
We will go now the Marry Meeker of Morgan Stanley.
Brian Fitz for Marry Meeker
This is for Brian for Mary.  On Yahoo’s call the other day, they mentioned picking up former Google advertiser such as iVillage, can you talk through, what you guys are doing on the AdSense front to aggressively pursue and retain your publishers and separately would you give us any insite into the drivers of revenue per search this quarter or how those factors are trending?
Sergey Brin
Thanks for your question this is a Sergey.  I think that you hit the nail on the head with your former question.  You have a lot of question but to answer the former, the primary thing we work very hard for AdSense publishers, is just to make sure they have good monetization as well as good user experience.  And I think we are executing very well on that by virtue of developing the ad technologies which are in many ways similar to search technologies.  They increase both end user quality in relevance as well as monetization.  Now there have been a handful of losses over accounts relatively small ones and I haven’t seen any particular pattern from what I know that iVillage had some specialized functionality they were very interested in sort of and they weren’t looking so much of the core monetization which is what most publishers are interested in.
Brian Keith for Merry Meker
Thank You.
Operator
We will go next to Robert Peck with Bear Stearns.
Bob Tank
It’s Bob Tank here.  My question relates to AOL.  I know you can’t comments on any rumors speculation in the market.  But I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit further about some of the other synergies right now you have with your partner, beside from just being partner, whether be engineers working closely together whether it would be IM or VOIP integration and while you touching on that topic you could talk a little bit longer term on what you see as far as what Yahoo and Microsoft are doing with their IM integration and where VOIP and IM ultimately could go as far as cross platform integration?
Eric Schmidt
This is Eric, I feel like you have answered your question in the question.  Of course we can’t comment on any rumors.  I would tell you that AOL has been our longest and in many way tightest partner for many, many years.  We have teams that are covered on a wide variety of activities, they have expanded their base, we set the advertisers together, there are number of areas of technology involving advertising and video and so forth that had been collaborative in nature.  And that work continues and we hope it will continue for many, many years.  So they are very, very valued partner and we hope it will be forever.  With respect to VOIP and Instant Messaging integration it would really require me to speculate on some products that we are building and the structure of the industry and because we don’t do that.  It is obvious that Instant Messaging and Voice over IP are going to become very, very significant components of people’s online experience.  Google as you know has a product in that area called Google Talk, which we introduced over the quarter, it looks like it’s doing extremely well.  It may be helpful to say right at the top, that we don’t do the same thing as everyone else does.  And so if you try to predict our product strategy by simply saying, so and so has this and Google will do the same thing.  It’s almost always the wrong answer.  We look at markets as they exist and we assume that they are pretty well served by the existing players.  We try to see new problems in new markets using the technologies others use and then we build.  Next question.
Operator
We will go next to Christa Quarles, for Thomas Weisel Partners.
Christa Quarles
First I was wondering if as you looked at free Wi-fi mobile services, is it your vision that in three years from now you still be monetizing all of that primarily through advertising or do you see yourself incorporating another revenue line?  And in the second question will be just a comment on your views on Thin Client computing, obviously you started on a relationship with Sun, you have a history with Sun, I am just wondering should we see cheap devices out there at some point, and just your thoughts on that?  Thanks.
Eric Schmidt
For the first part of that, Jonathan?
Jonathan Rosenberg
I am sorry the second part was Thin Client, the first part was?
Christa Quarles
The idea that either would you always be monetizing through advertising?
Jonathan Rosenberg
Well there are so many products that we have today that we monetize in ways other than advertising and _____ Google the enterprise product.  But, right now it is the engine that is really driving our current economic prosperity, is this big sea change that we’ve seen from transitioning offline dollars to online.  And if you look at the relative opportunity there, I think what you are going to see is that there is going to be significant more money transitioning into the be pay-per-click model that we’ve evolved and you are going to see other types of efforts along with the brand advertising increasingly growing.  I also think you are going to see other platforms that would be able to apply the add network to and we’ve have been doing some experimenting in some of those areas with print and magazines and I think you‘ll see some continued growth there.  But, the main focus is absolutely going to be this sea change in advertising.
So the second part of the question was really about Thin Client models and again when you are using a term that means a lot of things to different people, we prefer to think about it in terms of what does the end user actually want?  The end user basically wants to see the same kind of information on any device anywhere all the time.  So, if you call that Thin Client and that’s what we mean, and if you mean something else by Thin Client then that’s not what we mean.  And the technology has moved to the point where it’s possible to have a unified online experience that spans your mobile phone, your personal computer, all the new devices that are coming out of the next few years and Google intends to be the primary mechanism for access and search of all that information.  As we highlighted earlier we have done a large number of interesting deals with mobile operators already as a part of that initial thrust.  With respect to Sun, Sun has turned out to be a very valuable partner with respect to toolbar distribution and potential distribution of our other open source technologies and that’s an important component of brining in user services to all these new devices, and to really give choices to which platform they want to use.
Operator
We will go next Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs.
Anthony Noto
Thank You very much you.  Eric, you guys have done a excellent job with leveraging the search productivity, recycle elements and taking this information driving better click to use coverage and PPC as well as leveraging site targeted at advertising and I was wondering if you could comment on how those factors compare in the United States versus international on a relative basis.  Is international 30% of what are doing in United States is at parity, then someone mentioned, going after other platforms, I was wondering can site targeting be done in IPTV with branded advertising to the television platform?  Thank you.
Omid Kordestani
Hi Anthony, this is Omid.  In terms of internationally again we don’t break down specific numbers but, what I can say is that, one as Eric noted last quarter we have been extremely busy building our capabilities and what we are seeing is that this model is truly working.  Very similarly across the globe, the transition to media is happening, the interest in one of the spectrum of advertiser from local advertisers to a large advertisement company is happening.  In China for example we have recently signed four resellers doing a great job of, bringing us new customers.  And frankly in areas where people probably some of these customers don’t even have PC’s these advertisers are being setup by these resellers to purchase packages of clicks in effect.  So I think the metrics really will have to do with the maturity of the market, so UK is obviously our strongest market, overseas for us, we are doing really well in Japan but in terms of specific update, we are not breaking those down at this point.  And second question I think, I would like Eric to address it.
Eric Schmidt
The main thing that you really want to look at, we tend to have a cycle as you look at the each of these countries and obviously this was led primarily in the US and you see in particular some on the Western European Countries are little bit behind in terms of just maturity of the online market.  If you look internationally across the world, I think the main issue in terms of predicting the dynamics in the countries broadly is the scope of commerce.  And so you see some countries where there isn’t as much user behavior and interest in engaging in commerce online or they don’t have the shipping infrastructure to allow the transaction for goods and services to be consummated online.  And so I think there are some areas there where some of the international areas in kind of much more nascent stages of online commerce where you don’t see the monetization.
Operator
Will come from Safar Rashtchy with Piper Jaffrey.
Safar Rashtchy
Good afternoon and congratulations on another awesome quarter.  I want to dig in a little bit I know you answered this question but some of the questions that were asked but, I would like to know if I could dig into the discrepancy which I believe is the biggest you’ve had so far in the growth of Google network as compared to your partners, I think Omid was talking about of maybe eluding to potentially a market share gain that might have helped, could you talk a little bit about more about is this  stage of product introduction that you tested on Google network that we could see some of this in the coming quarters, come up within your partners, is there a more permanent shift of traffic or other things at play here?
Omid Kordestani
Hi Safa this is Omid.  Let others add any comments that they seem fit here.  I think we are actually observing the search very very closely and what we are finding is the major partnership in this space are long term contracts that we have already established and so there is not kind of significant big partnerships that we could establish in the near term and so the search network is pretty stable for us.  We still see that there is tremendous opportunity in the content network and we are busy servicing that both with our field organizations and our online services.  I think it’s just a nature of how the traffics are evolving, partners are spending, on ways to marketing to bring traffic to the sites and in certain quarters we see that having an effect on the traffic of the network, we see them changing the formats of ads versus the amount of ad they show, the amount of search they show.  So, again. I think the trends are continuing and we are doing really very well with our search properties and growing the share and the partners are stable with us with a long term contracts and we are focusing in the new areas like content targeting and site targeting to hopefully expand opportunities for everyone.
Eric Schmidt
Yeah Hi Safar thank you, a good question.  On the market share front we do a lot internal studies and I know some of you guys do as well and basically from what we can tell, looks like we are holding or gaining market share really in virtually all markets. So, I think the general trends that read about in the external studies that you’ve seen are accurate.
Operator
We will go next to Heath Terry with Credit Suisse First Boston.
Heath Terry
Great.  I was wondering if you could talk just a little bit about gmail, as we continue to go through the Beta period here, can you just talk about some of the trends that you are seeing whether it’s in signup’s, whether its in click-through and monetization there.  How does monetization with gmail compare to what you see with your broader search business and how would you have us think about the opportunity within mail for Google down the road?
Sergey Brin
We are very excited about gmail, but at this stage we are looking at it as still a platform off of which to built rather than a sort of big revenue driver in itself.  The kinds of services that we are able to launch off of that is for example Google Talk that was mentioned earlier but, also many others that we are testing, we think that it’s a very interesting area, at the end we think that there is a lot of new innovation to be had, just with email.  But, also with the related communications area, I am just dealing with people’s important information, which I feel in most of our cases we have just a huge amount of information that’s important to us that’s in our email.  So, we still view this as a platform for us to build off of and to experiment off of.
Operator
Ladies and gentleman, due to the time constraints we will take a final question from Paul Keung at CIBC World Market.
Paul Keung
Very impressive revenue growth, I was wondering how much of the growth this quarter came from new products site, like Google SMS, or SSAD or some new initiatives like site targeting when you compare with more traditional monetization products.  Would it be fair to say that your expected accelerated sequential growth, which is nearly did not expect to be entirely due to these product initiatives?
Eric Schmidt
When we look at the quarter, we see improvements in monetization across the board.  The growth occurs by virtue of the focus on quality, building up a network, extending our partners, adding more advertisers, it really expands all of the categories that you described.  So, it is not a single product that we introduced that somehow causes it to happen.  It is a discipline around new product invasion that really touches across the entire portfolio of the company.
So, with that it looks like we are out of time and I want to end by saying I really appreciate people taking the time to be on the call, to listen and to study what we are doing, things are obviously going very well here.  What you are seeing is you are seeing I think the consequence the systematization of a business, which really is about results and advertisers results, results are around information, metrics driven model for end users and for advertisers that has really scaled.  What is great about this business is that it can be extended very, very broadly.  The underlying principles that we’ve talked about, the principles of innovation, of how we manage our engineering teams and the focus around technology, creativity, the culture that has been built, in my opinion will deliver these kinds of results, this kind of opportunity for many years to come.  This is a very, very, very big space that we are in and that’s why it’s exciting to be part of Google.  Thank you all, so very much for spending time with us.
