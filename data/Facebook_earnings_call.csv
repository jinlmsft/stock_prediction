And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Deborah, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a solid quarter, and our community and business continue to grow quickly. 2.3 billion people now use Facebook every month, and 1.5 billion every day. Revenue grew 33% year over year to $13.7 billion.
Last quarter, for the first time, we also shared the number of people who use at least one of our apps each month. We believe this is a better way to measure our community over time because so many people use more than one of our apps. There are now more than 2.6 billion people using Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger each month, up from around 2.5 billion last quarter. But now, on average, more than 2 billion people use at least one of our services every day.
Today, I want to talk about our strategy overall as we navigate challenges and opportunities on several fronts. For one, we're seeing the way people connect shifting to private messaging and stories. We have great products here that people love, but it will take some time for our business to catch up to our community growth.
Two, we're seeing video grow dramatically across the ecosystem. And while Watch is now growing very quickly, we're well behind YouTube and still working to make this a unique people-centric experience. Three, we continue to face increased safety and security threats. We've significantly improved our systems here, but we have more to do.
So let's start with messaging and stories. Public sharing will always be very important, but people increasingly want to share privately too, and that includes both just smaller audiences with messaging and ephemerally with stories. People feel more comfortable being themselves when they know their content will only be seen by a smaller group and when their content won't stick around forever. Messaging and stories make up the vast majority of growth in the sharing that we're seeing.
On messaging specifically, we think we've built the best messaging apps in the world. People now send around 100 billion messages each day using our services that even our second most popular service, Messenger, has a higher daily message volume than SMS had globally at its peak. And this isn't just text. People share more photos, videos and links on WhatsApp and Messenger than they do on social networks.
We are leading in most countries, but our biggest competitor by far is iMessage. And in important countries like the U.S., where the iPhone is strong, Apple bundled iMessage as a default texting app and it's still ahead. In countries where there's more competition between iOS and Android, like much of Europe, people tend to prefer our services.
Now, it's worth noting that one of the main reasons people prefer our services, especially WhatsApp, is because of its stronger record on privacy. WhatsApp is completely end-to-end encrypted, does not store your messages and doesn't store the keys to your messages in China or anywhere else. And this is important because if our systems can't see your messages, then that means that governments and bad actors won't be able to access them through us either.
Our roadmap focuses on continuing to make WhatsApp and Messenger even simpler, faster and adding basic utility features like payments. We found that every time we make our services faster and simpler, people communicate more. We'll also keep pushing our messaging services to be more private and secure, and we believe this will continue to be a competitive advantage for us.
On the business side of messaging, our first step has been to enable people to connect with businesses organically in ways they find useful, and then the second step is to give businesses additional paid tools to increase those interactions. We're well into step one at this point, with more than 3 million accounts on WhatsApp Business. We'll begin step two with a couple of products, paid messaging and ads in Stories.
And by making businesses pay to send messages, we believe it will make them more selective with what they send. Payments will make each of these services more useful for people and businesses, even though we don't plan to profit from it directly. I'll update with more progress on each of these efforts in the next few quarters.
On Stories, we are even better-positioned. People now share more than 1 billion stories every day. We lead in almost every country. There are a couple of reasons we've focused on building Stories in all of our apps. First, I just think that this is the future. People want to share in ways that don't stick around permanently, and I want to make sure that we fully embrace this.
Second, Stories is a medium like feeds that can feel very different in very different contexts. So just like most major social apps have feeds, including Pinterest, Twitter, or LinkedIn, but you wouldn't say that those services do the same things, I think many services will have Stories in the future too, but will serve different functions.
Now, while this effort is going well, we're also working through a couple of challenges here. One is that while WhatsApp Status and Instagram Stories immediately took off and have been huge successes, Facebook Stories started off slower. It's now growing quickly and I think we'll be in a better position soon, but our effort to shift Facebook from News Feed first to Stories first hasn't been as smooth as I had hoped. But this is important for the Facebook community long term.
Another challenge is that we're earlier in developing our ads products for Stories, so we don't make as much money from them yet as we do from feed ads. We're following our normal playbook here of building out the best consumer products first and focusing on succeeding there before ramping up ads. I'm optimistic that we'll get ads in Stories to perform as well as feed over time, and that the opportunity will be even bigger because it looks like Stories will be a bigger medium than feed has been.
But I want to be up front that even assuming that we get to where we want to go from a feed-only world to a feed plus Stories world, it will take some time and our revenue growth may be slower during that period like it was while transitioning our products to mobile.
Now, talking about messaging and Stories raises the question of what's the future of our feed product and the Facebook app overall. On feed specifically, people continue to use them heavily and we don't expect that to decrease. From a business perspective, feeds will drive the majority of our growth over the next couple of years, at least until Stories become an even bigger driver.
On the Facebook app overall, what we see is that we are generally stable, although we may be close to saturated in developed countries while we continue to grow quickly in developing countries. For a few years, we saw a trend where people's time was increasing primarily because they were consuming more video and public content, even as they interacted with friends and family less. But people were telling us what they wanted was to interact with people more. So we didn't think that this trend was sustainable.
We've made a number of changes this year to focus the product on meaningful social interactions, and those generally seem to be working. That means the trends in how people are interacting have improved, even though we've purposefully reduced time spent on things like lower-quality viral videos and news to achieve this.
While there's a lot to do to improve News Feed, our roadmap for the Facebook app is very focused on a few priorities: Stories, which we've discussed; video, which I'll get to in a moment; and a much bigger focus on communities and groups.
If the last 10 years have been about friends and family, then the next 10 years will be about your communities as well. When we say communities, we mean both helping people connect with people who share their interests, which is a major need in people's lives, and also building out specific services for bringing people closer together, like helping you find someone to date, or find a job, or buy and sell things, or grow your small business, or create an event, or start fundraisers, or bring together a group to volunteer.
A lot of these services are growing quickly. Hundreds of millions of people now belong to meaningful communities that are a central part of their social support structure. Marketplace is now used by 800 million people and is emerging as one of the most popular places to buy vehicles online. On jobs, our new tool has helped people find more than 1 million jobs. On fundraisers, in the last year we've helped people raise more than $300 million for charities on their birthdays alone. And I'm looking forward to rolling out dating across the world soon too.
These are services that generally benefit from having everyone you know connected on a single platform. And while people may not spend as much time on some of these tools as they do in News Feed, these are very high-value activities for our community.
Now, we're seeing a similar dynamic in Instagram, where there's still a lot to improve in feed, but we're increasingly focused on other experiences as well. But in Instagram, instead of focusing on communities, we're very focused on helping you explore your interests. So this will take the form of IGTV, which I'll discuss more in a minute, plus new shopping experiences and really building out Explore. These areas have huge potential for serving our community and a lot of potential for businesses as well. For example, Explore is already about 20% of the time that people spend in Instagram. But unlike feed, we haven't built any ads experience for it yet, so that's an opportunity.
Now, I want to discuss what we're seeing with video specifically, since it's such an important and growing area. Our efforts here have grown, but we've had challenges reconciling all this passive video consumption with what people uniquely want from us, which is meaningful social interaction.
Video has grown a lot on our services, but as I mentioned earlier, we hit a dynamic where when it grows in feeds in Facebook and Instagram, it displaces some social interactions, and people tell us it makes the experience less valuable even though they're spending more time on it.
So the solution to this has been building separate video experiences outside of our feeds with Watch on Facebook and IGTV on Instagram. And what we found is that when people seek out video experiences intentionally, they don't displace social interactions as much, and the quality of the experience is generally higher. We've also been able to build experiences that help creators build communities around their content, which fits our mission and our focus to encourage meaningful interactions.
At this point, Watch has really hit its stride and it's growing incredibly quickly, about 3x in the last few months in the U.S. alone. IGTV is still earlier in its development, but I think we have a good sense of how to make it work as well. To be clear, these services are still well behind YouTube, which is our primary competitor in this space, but they're growing very quickly.
Now, that said, beyond the mission challenges of video displacing social interactions, there is also a business challenge, which is that video monetizes significantly less well per minute than people interacting in feeds. So this means that even though we've made video more community-oriented and minimized displacement of social interactions, as video grows, it will still displace some other services where we'd probably make more money.
From a mission and a business perspective, though, we still believe this is the right thing to do. Video is a critical part of the future. It's what our community wants as long as we can make it social, and I think will end up being a large part of our business as well.
All right, next I want to talk about safety and security. So let me start by saying that last month, we had a serious security issue. Our teams did well to find and close the vulnerability quickly, but we have a long road ahead to prevent these kinds of attacks in the future. Over the last couple years, though, we've done a lot of work and made a lot of progress. We still have at least a year before our systems are at the level that we want, but they're getting better every day, and that's both technology and people.
Our systems for proactively identifying harmful content are improving. Our systems for detecting interference in elections are a lot more mature now. The upcoming elections will be a real test of the protections we've put in place. With a community of more than 2 billion people, we will see all the good and bad that humanity can do. And we will never be perfect, but I'm proud of the work that we're doing here.
We've reduced the incentives to spread misinformation. We're partnering more closely with governments and outside experts to improve security, including here in the U.S. And we set a new standard for transparency in advertising. This quarter alone, we've found and taken down foreign influence campaigns from Russia and Iran attempting to interfere in the U.S., UK, Middle East, and elsewhere, as well as groups in Brazil that have been active in their own country. We still have a lot of work to do in all of these areas that I've talked about.
News Feed continues to be very important. We're building the best messaging and stories and community tools in the world. Our video services are getting better and growing quickly, and we still have a lot of work to do on safety. And we're also heavily investing in AR and VR, as well as hardware for bringing people closer together, like Portal for video presence and Oculus Quest, the all-in-one VR experience that delivers rift like quality with no wires attached.
So with all of this ahead, I expect 2019 to be another year of significant investment. Dave will say more about this in a moment, but I want you to know that looking out beyond 2019, I know that we need to make sure our costs and revenue are better matched over time; and that's something that I'm focused on as well.
So, overall, this has been an important year. It's been a tough year, but we've built products that I'm proud of and we've made a lot of progress on some of our hardest issues. As always, I appreciate your support. And thank you for being a part of this journey with us.
And now, here is Sheryl.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Hi, everyone.
It was another good quarter for our business, with ad revenue up 33% year over year. Our growth was broad-based across regions, marketer segments and verticals. Mobile ad revenue grew 40% to $12.5 billion, making up approximately 92% of our total ad revenue. Since Facebook launched its first ad products, we've been in the business of growing our clients' businesses, from the largest brands in the world, to the entrepreneur in her living room.
Over 90 million businesses rely on Facebook pages to reach potential customers for free. In a global survey, half of small businesses with a presence on Facebook said that they are hiring because of growth they're able to achieve through our platform. More than 6 million advertisers are active across Facebook, Instagram and our other services. With more than 2 billion people using at least one of our services every day, we're the best place for these advertisers to show people ads that work.
We know that our continued growth depends upon maintaining the trust of the people who use our services and earning our clients' business each and every day in a very competitive environment. Every time I meet with clients, I tell them that we want to be the best minute and the best dollar, euro or peso they spend. As we look ahead to 2019 and beyond, we're focused on continuing to build our clients' businesses and ours by helping advertisers reach consumers where they are and making ads better.
First, helping advertisers connect with people where they are. Consumers often adopt new technologies before businesses do. Our competitive advantage is helping advertisers close that gap. We've done this before on desktop, mobile and News Feed. In the early days, we helped businesses deliver personalized marketing at scale on desktop. With the shift to mobile, we've helped companies large and small build their mobile presence.
Now, we're doing it again with stories, messaging, Marketplace and Watch. Today, the primary way advertisers are reaching people on our services is through Facebook News Feed and Instagram Feed. Feed ads on Facebook and Instagram represent the majority of our revenue growth and the majority of opportunities for marketers to generate ROI.
Quarter after quarter, we make improvements that help advertisers use feed ads to launch new products, find new customers, build awareness and increase sales, all in a highly efficient way. We're always working to enable more marketers to achieve their goals through mobile feed, and we see continued opportunity here going forward.
At the same time, as Mark mentioned, more and more consumers are using stories and private messaging in addition to the time they spend in News Feed and Instagram Feed. Because our services share a common platform, advertisers can use the same tools to buy across all our ad services.
Building on the strength of ads and Instagram Stories, we rolled out ads in Facebook Stories in Q3 and announced plans to introduce ads in WhatsApp Status next year. We know it's not enough to make a new format available. We also need to make it easy for advertisers to optimize their campaigns.
In Q3, we improved how ads from News Feed look in Stories. This is important for advertisers like Pandora, which uses Facebook and Instagram to reach potential listeners. Previously, they would buy Instagram Story ad separately and develop unique creative each time. Now, with automatic placements, our technology converts their horizontal video and captions from Facebook into a design that looks native to the vertical Instagram Stories format. For Pandora, this resulted in a 10% lower cost per view than their stand-alone campaigns simply by checking a box in our ad tool.
When it comes to messaging, we have an opportunity to help people and businesses connect in ways that are valuable for both. On Messenger, over 10 billion messages are sent between people and businesses every month. It's still early, but we're exploring how we can help advertisers reach people in Messenger through sponsored messages and inbox ads.
For WhatsApp, we're growing our business ecosystem starting with the WhatsApp Business model app on Android. In August, we launched the WhatsApp Business API to help larger companies send useful information such as boarding passes or delivery confirmations. This paid messaging model will ensure that companies are selective about what they send and don't clutter people's chats. As always, people will be able to block any business they want with one tap. As we build the business on WhatsApp, we're determined to maintain the simple private user experience that people love.
That's also true for Marketplace and Watch. Last year, we started allowing advertisers to extend their News Feed ads to Marketplace, helping businesses reach people where they already shop. In Q3, we expanded Marketplace ads to nearly 70 marketers. It's early days, but advertisers are seeing good results.
With Facebook Watch, we've been working closely with advertisers to better fit their current planning and buying process for video. In Q3, we introduced a way for advertisers to buy video placements from a selection of the most engaging publishers, choose specific content categories they want their ads to play alongside, and pay only for ads that are watched to the end. Again, it's still early, but we're pleased with advertiser interest and results so far.
We have a big opportunity to help our large and growing advertiser base expand to new platforms and formats to reach potential customers. Our service makes it possible for every business to access the same tools as the largest brands. We start by making it simple for small businesses to transition from using our consumer apps to using our business tools, and then we make it easy to run more sophisticated campaigns.
This has been true every step of our journey so far, from online to mobile and now for messaging and stories. In the future, this will include opportunities with the new VR/AR platforms that we're creating as well.
We're also focused on making ads better. One of the top things people tell us about our ads is that they want them to be relevant. We create value for people when we show ads they are likely to find useful, for advertisers when we deliver ads to the right audience, and for our own business by performing this match effectively.
Our business model is and always has been to connect people and businesses with relevant marketing messages without sharing people's personal information. Protecting people's privacy is incredibly important because people and businesses will only use our services if they feel Facebook can be trusted and if sharing on our platform is safe. That's why we're making significant ongoing investments to better protect privacy and security.
In Q3, we completed the shutdown of partner categories and tightened our standards for Custom Audiences. These changes help protect peoples' privacy and ensure that advertisers have more oversight of the information they use for advertising. We also continue to invest heavily in technology and people to remove bad content as quickly as possible and prevent it from going up in the first place, while giving advertisers more control over where their ads are placed.
This quarter, we added more tools for advertisers to see where their ads might appear in Audience Network, Instant Articles and instream placements like Watch. They can block their ads from running in videos or articles from certain publishers or categories of content and review all of their placements at the end of each campaign.
Making ads better also means increasing efficiency for advertisers. In Q3, we expanded campaign budget optimization so advertisers of all sizes can now set a single budget, and our system automatically finds the best opportunities across each of those segments. Improvements like this one add up and help businesses maximize the value they're gaining from our products over time. This is critical for small businesses that don't have large advertising budgets or expertise, and it's an important way we support economic growth and job creation around the world.
As we wrap up the year, I want to thank our clients for their partnership and their continued feedback which helps us improve. And I also want to thank our teams at Facebook for helping these businesses reach their customers and grow.
And now, here is Dave.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with our community metrics. Daily active users on Facebook reached 1.49 billion, up 9% compared to last year, led by growth in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. This number represents approximately 66% of the 2.27 billion monthly active users in Q3. MAUs were up 199 million or 10% compared to last year.
Note that our Q3 2018 community metrics reflect an update to our calculation methodology. This resulted in the removal of the small percentage of accounts or approximately 15 million DAU and 9 million MAU worldwide. This change will modestly impact our year-over-year user growth rates until we lap it next year. Further details are included in the earnings slides on our IR website.
Turning now to the financials, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q3 revenue was $13.7 billion, up 33% or 34% on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant compared to last year, Q3 total revenue would have been $159 million higher.
Q3 total ad revenue was $13.5 billion, up 33% or 35% on a constant currency basis. In terms of regional ad growth, Asia Pacific was strongest at 38%, followed by Europe and North America at 34% and 33%, respectively. Rest of world ad growth trailed at 26% due to both currency weakness and economic challenges in Latin America.
Mobile ad revenue was $12.5 billion, up 40%, and represented approximately 92% of total ad revenue. In Q3, the average price per ad increased 7% and the number of ad impressions served across our services increased 25%, driven primarily by feed ads on Instagram and Facebook.
Our impression growth in Q3 came primarily from product surfaces and geographies that monetize at relatively lower rates. For example, ads in Instagram Stories contributed to our impression growth this quarter, although these ads currently monetize at lower rates compared to feed ads. Payments and other fees revenue was $188 million, up 1%.
Turning now to expenses. Total expenses were $7.9 billion, up 53%. We ended Q3 with approximately 33,600 full-time employees. That's up 45%. The majority of our new hires in the past year have been in technical functions. Operating income was $5.8 billion, representing a 42% operating margin. Our Q3 tax rate was 13%. This was lower than we expected because we did not take the one-time charge that we anticipated due to the Ninth Circuit Court withdrawing its decision in the Altera case.
Net income was $5.1 billion or $1.76 per share. Capital expenditures were $3.3 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. In Q3, we generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with approximately $41.2 billion in cash and investments. In the third quarter, we bought back approximately $4.3 billion of our Class A common stock.
Turning now to the revenue outlook, in Q4, we expect that our total revenue growth rate will decelerate by a mid to high single-digit percentage compared to our Q3 total revenue growth rate. Several factors are contributing to this deceleration. First, we expect more of our impression growth to continue to come from product services and geographies that monetize at lower rates. Second, we are seeing some impact from data privacy initiatives on pricing growth. And third, as we focus more of our product efforts on the growth of Stories, its more prominent placement on Facebook will displace some ad impression opportunities.
Turning now to the expense outlook, we anticipate our full-year 2018 total expenses will grow approximately 50% to 55% versus our prior range of 50% to 60%. We anticipate that full-year 2018 capital expenditures will be approximately $14 billion to $14.5 billion compared to our prior estimate of $15 billion.
Turning to tax, at current stock prices, we expect that our Q4 tax rate will be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, fluctuations in our stock price will impact our tax rate.
I'd also like to share our initial outlook on 2019 operating expenses and CapEx. As Mark mentioned, we plan to continue to invest aggressively across the business and expect that full-year 2019 total expenses will grow 40% to 50% compared to full-year 2018. We also expect that full-year 2019 capital expenditures will be approximately $18 billion to $20 billion, driven by a continuation of our data center build strategy that seeks to put in place adequate capacity ahead of our needs. We anticipate that our full-year 2019 tax rate will be in the mid-teens.
The third quarter marked a period of both solid revenue growth across the globe and heavy investment as we make progress on our mission to bring the world closer together. We are confident in our ability to improve the products that our community loves as well as to provide innovative new experiences in the near and long-term.
And with that, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask two. First for Mark, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about some of the challenges that you see for Stories within Facebook relative to their stronger adoption in Instagram and for WhatsApp Status. And then also, what if Stories don't gain traction on Facebook over time here? How do you think about that for the platform as well?
And then, secondly, for Dave, just on OpEx for 2019, the 40% to 50% growth, should we think about that as still the same buckets of spend that you've been talking about over the last year or so, and does their prioritization change at all for next year? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, so I can take the first part. I think a lot of this is really basic. When I say that we got started slower on Facebook, that starts with literally rolling out on Facebook a number of months after we had rolled out on either WhatsApp or Instagram. And then the initial version of what we shipped I just think wasn't as high-quality as where it needed to be. It wasn't as fast. There were bugs. And we've been working on dialing that in.
I'm less worried at this point about it not working because we're starting to see it really take off. Certainly, with different groups of people, it's stronger on Instagram or WhatsApp or Facebook, but across all three at this point, it's growing. And as I said in my opening remarks, I think we're going to be a lot better positioned here in Facebook in the next year.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Hey, Doug. It's Dave. Just on the 2019 expense growth guide, a lot of that is consistent with what we've been talking about as our big investment areas. If you look at just head count growth in the past year, it's up 45%. So that compensation expense base that we're bringing into 2019 is really factoring into the overall growth guidance for the total expense guide, so that's a big factor there.
In addition, we've been investing significantly in CapEx, and those investments are starting to flow through the P&L in terms of depreciation. And then I'd point to significant investment areas like AR/VR efforts, the content ecosystem around video, and the ongoing investment in safety and security.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you so much, maybe one for Sheryl. When you think about some of the friction points you're trying to solve for on either the creative side or the selling-through side with respect to video and Stories, maybe you could call out some of the conversations you're having with advertisers and how you see some of the moves Facebook can make to solve for those friction points looking out to 2019 and beyond. Thanks so much.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks for the question. We have a very large and growing advertiser base, and that gives us we think a really strong position to get people into new formats. When you do that, a couple of things really matter. One is that the format of an ad really has to match the format of the consumer experience. So the right ad in News Feed is different than the right ad in an Instagram or a Facebook story is different than the right ad in Watch, which would be video-only. And so making these new formats of ads is actually hard for people and expensive. And so we're working hard on tools to make the formats easier, and I talked about one of those examples before.
What's nice is that the same targeting, the same measurement systems really work. Because we are looking to show relevant ads to the right person at the right time, the systems we have that understand in a privacy-protected way what ads people are likely to be more interested in, those work, whether you're in Stories or Watch or Instagram Feed or News Feed.
And the other thing is that our systems for measuring the effectiveness of ads, which help advertisers get all the way through to their ROI, which help them bid in our system, also work. And so we take the advertiser base, we take the systems we have for targeting and measuring ads, and then we help advertisers move to the new format. And I think that's the process we're on.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, last quarter, Dave, you made some comments about a multiyear margin outlook, and I appreciate the comment this quarter about engagement in the feed, et cetera. I was just curious when you thought about that margin outlook, how do you think about the one or two key drivers of News Feed monetization over the next few years, given you expect to be flat overall engagement?
And then secondly on Watch, I'm wondering, Mark. Could you just talk about the key one to two steps you need to sort of clear in order to drive higher Watch and video engagement to sort of catch up with some of the competitors? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Hey, Brian. It's Dave. In terms of what we're seeing as opportunities, I mean, we continue to see good growth opportunities for revenue across both Facebook and Instagram, including both feed and Stories. I think in terms of impression growth, you're going to have more opportunities in Stories, probably more opportunity on Instagram, but good revenue growth opportunities in both places. So that's obviously what we're looking for when we look forward. Beyond that, I don't have much to update on in terms of any more specific revenue outlook.

And to the video questions, the biggest thing that we need to do is make sure that the video experience is people-centric and that we're helping creators build community and we're helping people interact with each other. Our journey with video has been a little bit funny, in that people really want to watch a lot of video. And to a large degree, we've had to limit its growth and we had to do the things so we can stop limiting it.
The things that have caused us to limit it are, on the one hand, when we see passive consumption of video displacing social interactions, that's not something that we've wanted because we feel like that's what Facebook is. We build social products that help people interact. There are lots of places in the world that you can go to consume content, but we're the Internet service that people use to help connect with other people and we're not going to let passive consumption get in the way of that.
So we needed to figure out a way so that video can grow, but people can also keep on interacting doing what they tell us that they uniquely want from Facebook. And now, I think we're starting to work through what the formula is going to be so we can take some of those rate limits off and let video grow at the rate it wants to. And I think that's a very exciting opportunity ahead, and that's one of the reasons that I'm very optimistic about the Watch growth that we've started to see recently up about 3x in the last few months in the U.S. alone.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Mark, first, on Facebook engagement. There are some questions about usage. And when you look at the engagement, do you see it stable? I think you mentioned that earlier. And does that include some of the changes you've made on video earlier in the year?
And then, secondly, some usage may be moving over to Instagram. When you look at Facebook plus Instagram, how do you feel about how that usage is trending? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So I mean across the whole family of apps, I mean all of this engagement is growing quickly and we're very happy with how we're enabling people to share. As I said, the vast majority or the majority of the growth that we're seeing in sharing is coming from private messaging and story sharing. So that's kind of the big thing.
The basic story that we've seen within the Facebook app is, over the last few years, the amount of time that people were spending in the app was increasing primarily because people were consuming more public content, like passive video consumption and news. But it was coming at the expense of people interacting with each other as much. So interactions were down. And we got a lot of feedback from people saying that's not what they wanted.
We don't think that that's what we're uniquely here to do. It's not the mission of the company. So we felt like that was not sustainable. So we've made a lot of shift this year, which I've talked a lot about on a bunch of these calls, to encourage more meaningful social interactions instead. And we have seen that those changes have improved the trajectory of how people are interacting.
Now, at the same time that we have intentionally reduced time spent on certain things, like lower-quality viral videos, some news, some passive content, but that's what I was talking about before when I said that now the trend – and you can kind of look at it in developed markets and developing. In developed markets, it is stable and we feel like we're pretty close to saturation in a lot of countries, like the U.S. And in developing countries, where a lot of people are still getting on the Internet, it continues to grow at a fast rate. And we think that there's a lot more connecting in community that people want there.
So that's kind of what we're seeing overall. Across the whole family, I would say it's very positive. On Facebook overall, I feel like we have a handle on what the drivers of this are and we're kind of driving it to be what people tell us they want and what we think is going to be sustainable over time. That's the picture that we have.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Two questions. Dave, you mentioned 4Q revenue is going to have a mid to high-single digit deceleration. That's a tad better than what you stated 90 days ago. So just I know it's a small change, but I think folks on the line are looking for anything incremental in terms of what you're seeing. Has anything improved? And then, any initial read on what kind of deceleration we can expect to see in 2019, if at all, as you start turning on the ads on WhatsApp?
And then, one for Sheryl. The shopping experience on Instagram, how do you compare, I guess, just the overall commercial intent on Instagram compared to Facebook? And what do you think that says about the long-term monetization potential for Instagram versus Facebook?
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
All right. Ross, I'll start off on that. I think the outlook that we're giving for Q4 deceleration is broadly consistent with the outlook that I gave last quarter with the benefit of a little bit more visibility. I'd just reiterate the points that I'd made in the earnings script around what's driving that deceleration.
And as far as to how that plays into 2019, we're not providing a specific revenue outlook for 2019. We continue to see good growth opportunities across the platform on both Facebook and Instagram and feed and Stories. Those are going to be the drivers. I would characterize the launch of Status apps on WhatsApp as being a much smaller thing than a driver of 2019 revenue growth, and it's going to be more about Instagram and Facebook. The same factors that I discussed impacting Q4 growth will likely continue to play out to some extent in 2019, but we've got a lot of good growth opportunities for next year.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
When you look at the Instagram Shopping experience, we're seeing some really nice growth. We have 90 million people tap to reveal product tags and posts every month to learn more about them, and we're putting real investments behind this. In Q3, we rolled out Shopping in Stories globally and began testing the Shopping Channel in Explore. And so, we think the opportunities are big.
As you think about commercial intent in Facebook versus Instagram, there's so much activity on both. We think there's a lot of opportunity for people to have commercial intent, if not have it when they start, but develop it because they see things they're interested in, in both. Instagram can be more interest-based in some places than Facebook. So there are places in Instagram like Fashion or like Shopping that have very high signal, and that gives us I think a very strong opportunity there.

Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Two questions, if I can. First, just, Mark, your comments in prepared remarks on Stories having potential to be a bigger medium than News Feed suggests that the engagement is a net positive in terms of time spent or sessions per user. Is that the right way to interpret that as you see people engage in this they actually spend more time overall?
And then, second question for Dave. Last quarter, you guided to kind of long-term operating margins in the mid-30s range. The guidance on OpEx for next year kind of implies we may already be there. Is that the right interpretation and should we expect it to be kind of stable beyond that based on some of the comments from Mark about recognizing that revenue and costs should be matched over the long-term? Any help you could give there would be great.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So on Stories, I don't know if we've given any metrics on time spent or anything on that side. But what I can say is that all of the trends that we've seen suggests that in the not too distant future people will be sharing more into Stories than they will into feeds, and that the whole market across all of the Stories type of products will be bigger in a market where people are sharing more moments from their days into Stories-type products than into feed-type products.
And this happened very quickly, right? I mean this whole trend is much newer than the trend with News Feed and feeds overall and it continues to grow incredibly quickly. So we just see that there is a lot of upside there.
Now, on the flip side, I try to be very careful in my remarks to be clear that this is one of those situations where the community growth that we're seeing is outpacing the progress that we've made so far on developing the ads in that space. And I think we'll get there over time, where the performance for Stories ads will converge with what we have seen in feed. And I think that the opportunity will be bigger because there will be more in Stories – or more Stories overall than in feed. But I can't tell you just yet what that timeframe is going to look like, but I think we're well-positioned over the long-term because we're leading in Stories in basically every country.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
And, Lloyd, on the margin question, as I mentioned, 2019 will be a big investment year. So I would expect us to have the biggest change in our margin structure to happen in 2019 and for it to moderate from there. It's hard to be too prescriptive about 2020 and beyond, but I think the biggest change will be 2019.

Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies.
Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Just on Europe, there's been a more pronounced deceleration. Just curious in terms of how you think about the stabilization there going forward in your model and maybe a little more color on the pricing.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Brent. It's Dave. I think, I guess, if you're talking about DAU and MAU, Europe is stable on that front in terms of Facebook overall. The accounting methodology change did affect how Europe sequential growth rate came in, but really stable if you kind of take that aside. And we had some impact from GDPR over the last two quarters. So I think, from that perspective, it is broadly stable for Facebook there.
European growth rate I think was healthy from a revenue point of view. So I think we're still seeing good growth in Europe on the revenue front, and a lot of the similar dynamics playing out in Europe as in the rest of the world where you see good impression growth opportunity, especially in areas like Instagram and Stories contributing to overall ability to drive revenue growth.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions. You seem confident that Stories will ultimately be a more effective canvas both for users and businesses and maybe even more so than the feed, but you also talked the transitional challenges. What specifically are those challenges? And since Instagram is further along with Stories, are there any things you're seeing with Instagram Stories monetization that gives you line of sight to reaching monetization parity, not only at Instagram, but also at core Facebook eventually?
And then maybe just a second one. In addition to Stories, Mark also discussed how private messaging is also a growth use case. In private messaging, the company has, understandably so, been cautious on the monetization side. So just curious if you could discuss how optimistic you are about building a meaningful business around private messaging.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
I can take those. When you think about the transition or people using feed versus Stories, there are a couple of things that are different. One is just the format. And again, we have a lot of experience at this. People had display ads or search ads before they really did Facebook ads, if you look back a decade. And teaching people here is what a Facebook ad looks like was a new format people had to understand. Then, as we moved into more photos with Instagram, more videos, a video ad on Facebook or Instagram is a very different thing if they perform well. They need to be natively social than a video ad that runs on TV.
So Stories is a new format. It has multiple pictures, multiple screens, words and phrases intermixed in a different way. And so again, that's a new muscle for advertisers. I think we're getting people up the curve well this time. We've learned that we can't just rely on teaching our clients and teaching the ad agencies to do it, but helping them do that. And so some of the tools we've rolled out that I talked about where we can take your Facebook pictures and your posts and make it a story, that makes that process faster.
I think when you think about the long-term monetization opportunities, it's really going to depend upon the time people spend. The amount of ads we would feel comfortable inserting into a consumer experience really depends upon how many different things you go through. So if you spend more time in Stories, they'll be need to be more engaging because there will be fewer ads in there.
Now that may be possible because there's high, high, high engagement in Stories. So we're going to have to see the length and how quickly people scroll through them to see how many ad opportunities there are and to see how effective those ad opportunities are. Our business depends upon the amount of ads that we can share and the effectiveness of those ads, which drives up ROI and ultimately the price.
When you think about messaging, if we've already made the transition in a big way to feed, if we are starting to see real success in Stories, messaging is in a much earlier stage. And what we're doing on Messenger and on WhatsApp are really making sure that businesses can connect with people, and then in the early stages of testing messaging. So we think paid messaging, as we've talked about.
And WhatsApp is interesting because by virtue of paying, businesses are going to have to be careful about the content they send. You're not going to send a lot of things people don't want to see if you're paying for them. And so really focused on the consumer experience there and figuring out over time.
The last thing I'll say is that I think these things are more connected than people realize, in the sense that we're already seeing some nice traction with click-to-Messenger ads. So one of the things advertisers are trying to do when they're in feed and ultimately when they're in Stories is drive to transactions and real engagement, one-on-one with a consumer is often part of that.
So a click-to-Messenger ad takes advantage of having both of those platforms so that businesses can deepen their relationship with the consumer. And I think those experiences and the interaction between them, we're even in earlier days there, but I think we have a lot of opportunity to explore there.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
And, Mark, this is Dave. I just wanted to add in. I think you asked about line of sight on monetization parity on Stories versus feed. It's obviously hard to say that because they're both dynamic, they're auctions, there's a lot going on. But I would say that at least in the near term, the impression growth opportunity is significant on Stories. Pricing will take time. So as we bring more formats to Stories and bring more advertisers to Stories, we can build up that demand and balance that out with supply. But I think in terms of it converging on feed from any pricing perspective, that's a journey that's going to take years, not quarters. So it's going to take time.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Evercore.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Thank you very much for taking my question. Just really one for Mark, which is, I don't think anyone has asked much about the security investments that Facebook is making. And when I talk to investors, people are curious whether it's one-off or recurring. And so as you think about 2019, the magnitude of the resources that the company plans to deploy to protect privacy, to protect security, it sounds like you're in or will be in, hopefully, a better position to ward off bad actors than you were prior to the 2016 election.
But I just wonder. Do you look at this as an endless arms race, or is there some point in this investment where you might be able to get some better efficiencies on those investments, also relative to others in the industry who are making investments that don't seem quite as sizable as Facebook's? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
This is a really important question. I do think that we are up against sophisticated adversaries who will continue to evolve. So there is a large element of this, which is an arms race. And when you're talking about security issues and some of the safety and content issues, these are not problems that we fix. They're problems that you manage over time and try to reduce and prevent issues from coming up, but there's no silver bullet where you do the thing and then you're done.
That said, I do think that we were quite behind where we needed to be a couple of years ago. We started a roadmap, which we said was going to be about a three-year roadmap. I think that we have some confidence in that timeframe, which takes us through the end of about 2019, to get our systems to the level that we generally think that they should be at, where we're building AI systems that can flag content that might be problematic to a much larger security and review team that can manage the larger volume of stuff that our tools are flagging to them.
We're judging our success by, go through all of the categories of harmful content and behavior, whether it's terrorism, or self-harm, or hate speech, or just any different kind of thing that you'd be worried about. We're judging our success by how proactive can we get, so what percent of the stuff that we're taking down are we identifying before other people identify it for us. We've started issuing transparency reports so we can be held publicly accountable on this.
What we see internally is that generally every week and every quarter that goes by, we're getting better and better at this. But I anticipate that it will be about the end of next year when we feel like we're as dialed in as we would generally all like us to be. And even at that point, we're not going to be perfect because more than 2 billion people are communicating on the service. There are going to be things that our systems miss, no matter how well-tuned we are.
But I think we're making progress. We've made a lot of progress in the last couple of years on content overall. Elections are a special case, an extremely important special case of the content and safety issues and security issues that we face. But across all of the different types of content issues of people trying to spread hate or incite violence. We are making progress, and I feel good about the progress that we're making. And I think we will continue investing more. But I do think that to some degree the last few years and next year are probably going to be the biggest growth in the investment in the security efforts that we'll see.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. I just had two questions and I guess maybe you just touched on some of this, Mark. But the CapEx growth that you guys gave for next year, how far ahead should we think about you guys building out capacity? And can you help us think about the ongoing trend, in particular in light of your comments that you just made about how you'll feel about being more dialed in at the end of 2019? But how do we think about kind of that continued growth and CapEx number? And is there anything there that's a one-time item?
And I guess the other question would just be related to Stories. And I guess, I'm just wondering, I know it's early days in terms of advertisers putting ad units in there at this point. But given that you've got the technology that converts to creative and kind of help people with that process of how to do a good Stories ad, how effective do you think that's been in terms of helping to drive their adoption of this ad unit thus far?
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Heather, I'll take the first question regarding CapEx. So, yeah, we are investing ahead of user growth, given the long lead time in deploying data centers and network capacity. So we are building some capacity ahead of our immediate needs. So that is playing into it. But we're also making investments to support the core growth of the business. There's a lot of compute that goes behind, things like feed ranking and ads ranking. We think there is good ROI to putting more servers behind things like choosing the right ad for the right impression opportunity that we have. So we are putting more compute behind that.
And then, I'd also make the comment that a lot of our growth is coming from markets in Asia, our top growth countries were India, Indonesia and the Philippines. So we're building capacity to serve that Asian peak and those users are at a lower ARPU. So that impacts the overall capital intensity. So we're continuing to invest and we're seeing increased CapEx in 2019, albeit at a much slower growth rate than we had in 2018.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
I'll talk about Stories and I'll share a fun and, I think, important example. We know that when people are using more of the opportunities to reach consumers, their returns often go up. So the fun example is the Furbo Dog Camera. They're a Taiwanese company. They built this camera where you can see/talk and you can see and talk and toss dog treats to your dog when you're not at home. They ran a video ad campaign across Facebook and Instagram Stories and they targeted people with dog-related interests and used Custom Audiences to exclude people who had already purchased their product. By running across Facebook Stories and Instagram Stories, they drove 20% more leads than our other digital campaigns. So anecdotally, with our early, early adopters, we can see that we believe the increased opportunities here really work, and we have other examples like this.
In terms of how early it is for adoption, it's super early. We just rolled out the ability to do this in August, and we have to drive awareness and drive people into trying it. And even when we make it super easy for people to get their ads into the right format, from the smallest mom-and-pop to the largest brands, people want to understand the creative of their ad and it needs to be in a format they feel comfortable. So as more people use Stories, we think they will increasingly feel comfortable in Stories. But we have a long road ahead of us even with tools that make it easy to drive awareness and adoption. We think once we do, the returns will be good.

Your last question comes from the line of Ralph Schackart from William Blair.
Ralph Edward Schackart - William Blair & Co. LLC
Good afternoon. Maybe switching gears to feed, you talked about it being a major growth driver and a lot of opportunities for improvement. Can you maybe share some perspective on what those opportunities look like from both a user, as well as an advertiser? And then also, maybe just more longer-term, how can feed continue to be a strong growth driver? Thanks.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
I can take that. When you think about feed, what people are doing is sharing. They're sharing in Instagram and Facebook. And that means there's, in many ways, almost limitless opportunity for consumers to do more. I think we've made some strong changes on Facebook in terms of meaningful social interactions, and I think the history of our ability to develop and iterate on consumer products shows that we can help people as they evolve, share the things they want to share, and have a very meaningful and important experience in feed as they're sharing.
Feed is fundamentally about information being pushed to a consumer and us helping figure out what is most interesting and most engaging and I think, in many ways, positive for people. And I think the product teams, led by Mark, have done a great job of that over time and you're seeing the continued investment there. Along with that, goes the advertising opportunities. As there are more Stories and feed, as more people are engaged in Facebook and increasingly in Instagram, that gives us more opportunities just on the supply side of ads.
On the demand side, all of the things we do to get more advertisers active in our system, means we'll have more ads to choose from, to make those ads more relevant, to measure the ROI of those ads so that people can then iterate and, again, make those more relevant. I think we've made real improvements there, but I think there's a lot more we can do.
And one of the ways I talk to people about it is just ask what percentage of the ads do you see in your feed are as good as the very best posts you see from friends. And I think most people will honestly say that certainly compared to a few years ago, those ads are much more relevant to them, but not all of them. And you can see in that example, even in your own feed, the opportunities we have to improve, finding the right ad and giving it to the right person at the right time, which drives businesses all around the world and drives our business as well.

Good afternoon. My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook's Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.
Deborah Crawford - Facebook, Inc.
Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's press release and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we may present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had another solid quarter. Revenue grew 42% year-over-year to $13.2 billion. And Facebook now has more than 2.2 billion monthly active with almost 1.5 billion actives using it every day.
For the first time today, we're also releasing how many people use at least one of our apps, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger, and that's 2.5 billion people each month. This number better reflects our community for a couple of reasons. First, it refers to individual people rather than active accounts, so it excludes when people have multiple active accounts on a single app. And second, it reflects that many people use more than one of our services. And Dave will explain this in a little more detail later.
I want to start by talking about all the investments we've made over the last six months to improve safety, security and privacy across our services. This has been a lot of hard work and it's starting to pay off.
We recently launched two important ad transparency tools: one to let anyone see the ads any page is running even if the ads aren't targeted to you; and the other an archive of ads with political or issue content that's starting in the U.S. ready for the midterm election. These ads are now labeled so you can clearly see who's paying for them and, within the archives, you can see the budget associated with each ad, how many people saw it, and search all ads with political or issue content that an advertiser has run for up to seven years. This level of transparency will mean increased accountability and responsibility for advertisers globally.
Over the next 18 months, there are important elections beyond the U.S. in Brazil, India, and the EU, and these will all be real tests for Facebook. But I'm confident that we will get this right given our results during last year's French and German elections, the Alabama special election, as well as this month's presidential election in Mexico, where our systems found and removed thousands of fake account pages and groups that violated our policies.
Of course, security is not a problem that you ever fully solve. We face sophisticated well-funded adversaries who are constantly evolving. But, during each election, we learn and improve too. We're also making progress in the fight against misinformation. We're getting rid of the financial incentives for spammers to create fake news, much of which is economically motivated. We stopped pages that repeatedly spread false information from buying ads. And we also use AI to prevent fake accounts that generate a lot of the problematic content from ever being created in the first place.
Our investments in AI mean that we can now remove more bad content quickly because we don't have to wait until after it's reported. It frees our reviewers to work on cases where human expertise is needed to understand the context or nuance of a situation.
In Q1, for example, almost 90% of graphic violence content that we removed or added a warning label to was identified using AI. This shift from reactive to proactive detection is a big change, and it will make Facebook safer for everyone.
I also want to talk about privacy. GDPR was an important moment for our industry. We did see a decline in monthly actives in Europe, down by about 1 million people as a result. And at the same time, it was encouraging to see the vast majority of people affirm that they want us to use context, including from websites they visit, to make their ads more relevant and improve their overall product experience.
Looking ahead, we will continue to invest heavily in security and privacy because we have a responsibility to keep people safe. But, as I've said on past calls, we're investing so much in security that it will significantly impact our profitability. We're starting to see that this quarter. But, in addition to this, we also have a responsibility to keep building services that bring people closer together in new ways as well.
Now, in light of increased investment in security, we could choose to decrease our investment in new product areas, but we're not going to, because that wouldn't be the right way to serve our community and because we run this company for the long term not for the next quarter. And Dave will talk about this in a few minutes.
Now, perhaps one of the most important things we've done this year to bring people closer together is to shift News Feed to encourage connection with friends and family over passive consumption of content. We've launched multiple changes over the last half to News Feed that encourage more interaction and engagement between people, and we plan to keep launching more like this.
Now, of course, connecting isn't limited to News Feed. Now, there are more than 200 million people that are members of meaningful groups on Facebook, and these are communities that, upon joining, they become the most important part of your Facebook experience and a big part of your real world social infrastructure. These are groups for new parents, for people with rare diseases, for volunteering, for military families deployed to a new base and more.
We believe there is a community for every one on Facebook. And these meaningful communities often spend online and offline and bring people together in person. We found that every great community has an engaged leader. But running a group can take a lot of time. So we have a road map to make this easier. That will enable more meaningful groups to get formed, which will help us to find relevant ones to recommend to you, and eventually achieve our five-year goal of helping 1 billion people be a part of meaningful communities.
Now, since the 1970s, there has been this long decline in people joining physical groups around the world, and that has contributed to a broad feeling of loneliness and isolation. But if we can help 1 billion people be a part of something meaningful, then that can help reverse this trend.
Talking about being a part of something meaningful, it's been inspiring to see how people are using our fundraising tools to make a difference. Last month, a campaign to raise $1,500 for undocumented children separated from their families at the border ended up going viral and raising more than $20 million from more than 0.5 million donors all around the world. This quarter, we added the ability for pages to create and donate to fundraisers for causes that they care about too.
This quarter, we also reached a milestone with now more than 1 billion actives on Instagram. And this is a moment to reflect on how this acquisition has been an amazing success. When Instagram joined us the team had only 16 people. And since then, Kevin and the team have built Stories, Direct, and now IGTV. This has been a story of great innovation and product execution. And it's also a story of how effective the integration has been.
We believe Instagram has been able to use Facebook's infrastructure to grow more than twice as quickly as it would have on its own. So a big congratulations to the Instagram team and to all the teams across our company that have contributed to this success.
I'm really excited about video too. And this quarter, we launched IGTV. People are watching less TV, but more video, but most video is not yet optimized for mobile. IGTV will help solve that problem. It's designed specifically for mobile and makes watching long-form vertical video from creators easy. There's a stand-alone IGTV app, but you can also watch within the Instagram app, so that means the entire Instagram community has been able to use it from the start.
We're also seeing Watch start to grow more quickly on Facebook too. Our teams are focused on building new experiences that help people connect and start conversation. We recently rolled out Watch Party to all groups, so you can watch and chat with friends at the same time. And we're seeing some real traction with some of the original program, from the talk show Red Table Talk, featuring Jada Pinkett Smith, to Skam, an interactive series that started in Norway and features a new style of storytelling where the characters have accounts on Facebook and Instagram, and key parts of the story are told not just through video, but through posts on their pages.
Stories continue to be a big part of the future of sharing too, and they're growing quickly across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. While we started off just implementing the basic Stories format, we've now moved well beyond it, and have built lots of new features like polls, questions, and collaborative stories and groups and events. And we're also making progress developing Stories into a great format for ads. We've made the most progress here on Instagram, but this quarter, we started testing Stories ads on Facebook too.
The other major trend we're seeing is the shift to more private messaging. There's a lot to build here. We've been testing payments on WhatsApp in India, and it gives people a really simple way to send money to each other and contribute to greater financial inclusion. And of the people who have tested this, feedback and usage have been very strong. All signs point to a lot of people wanting to use this when the government gives us the green light. And in the meantime, we've broadened our focus to building this for other countries so we can give more people this ability faster. Over the next five years, we're focused on building out the business ecosystem around messaging on WhatsApp and Messenger.
More broadly, our strategy is to use Facebook's computing infrastructure, business platforms and security systems to serve people across all of our apps. For example, we made the decision a decade ago to build our own data centers, and we opened our first custom-built data center in 2011. Today, we have six data centers around the world, and we're working on building eight more. We're using AI systems in our global community operations team to fight spam, harassment, hate speech, and terrorism across all of our apps to keep people safe. And this is incredibly useful for apps like WhatsApp and Instagram as it helps us manage the challenges of hyper-growth there more effectively.
Beyond apps and looking at the next 10 years, we're making a lot of progress with virtual reality. Our goal is to create that feeling of presence like you're right there with people you care about even if you might be halfway around the world. Oculus Go is off to a good start, and at $199, it's going to be how a lot of people experience virtual reality for the first time. Overall, this is a critical year for Facebook. We've made progress preventing abuse, forged ahead with new innovation, and are adapting our services to the new trends of messaging, Stories, videos and groups.
As always, thank you for being a part of this journey, and I'm looking forward to making more progress together. And now, here is Sheryl to talk about our business.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Hi, everyone. It was a good second quarter with ad revenue growing 42% year-over-year. Mobile ad revenue was $11.9 billion, a 50% increase year-over-year, making up approximately 91% of total ad revenue. Our growth, again, was broad-based across regions, marketer segments and verticals.
We are working to ensure that Facebook is a safe place for people and businesses. We've taken strong steps to address a number of issues, including election integrity, fake news and protecting people's information. One of the most important things we can do to affect change is to increase transparency because transparency leads to greater accountability.
For example, when anyone can see any ad on Facebook, advertisers have to stand behind the ads they run. Transparency also allows us to get more input from our community and from experts around the world, so that we can find and fix problems. We wish we could find everything ourselves, but we never will, so we're building tools to make it easier for people to report issues to us.
As Mark mentioned, this quarter, we took major steps to make advertising in pages more transparent. Now anyone can see all the ads a page is running across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Audience Network. You can also learn more about pages even if they don't advertise. You can see when a page was created and if they've changed their name.
For political and issue ads, we're going even further. Advertisers placing ads with political content are now required to verify their identity and location. These ads will be labeled with a disclosure about who paid for them and saved in a searchable archive.
The vast majority of ads on Facebook are run by legitimate organizations from small businesses looking for new customers to advocacy groups raising money for their causes. But we've seen that bad actors can misuse our products too, so we're erring on the side of transparency. We're being intentionally broad in our interpretation of political and issue ads. This includes ads for books about politicians and brand campaigns that touch on national issues.
Given our commitment to transparency, we think it's important to apply this policy to more ads rather than fewer. These steps are just the start. We'll keep looking for ways to improve, and we hope these tools become standard across the industry. As we make these investments in transparency and accountability, we remain focused on our key priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile, developing innovative ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First: leveraging the power of mobile. For businesses, winning on mobile now means winning on video. Globally, people are creating and watching more video, especially on mobile devices. According to eMarketer, nearly a quarter of the world's population will watch video on a mobile phone this year. We see this trend toward video across all of our apps, from people sharing more video with their friends on Facebook, to watching more video from creators on Instagram, to having more video calls on WhatsApp and Messenger.
Marketers are making more video of their own. We're seeing healthy growth in video ads among all advertiser segments. M&M's UK recently used mobile-optimized five-second video ads on Facebook and Instagram to introduce M&M's Mix, a bag of three kinds of M&M's in one. Their campaign worked, driving results not just for their new product but for the brand overall. Their sales increased by over 10% and 80% of that came from households that had not bought M&M's in the previous 26 weeks.
Second: developing new ad products. We know that creating video can be more difficult for small businesses that have fewer resources, so we've launched new tools on Facebook to help anyone make videos that work well on mobile. Last quarter, we released Ads Animator, a simple way to create eye-catching video ads using photos and other content that's already on a company's Facebook page. We're also testing Video Creation Kit, which gives advertisers easy-to-use video templates for different marketing objectives. By learning what performs best across our platform, we can help other businesses succeed.
We're also making it easier to run ads on Instagram and in Stories. Ads in Stories are an immersive engaging way for people to interact with businesses. When online retailer Overstock wanted to gain new customers and increase furniture sales, they ran video ads in Instagram Stories with a shop now button. They saw an 18% increase in return on ad spend and a 20% decrease in cost per acquisition. This quarter, we made it easier for more advertisers to adopt the Stories format. When an advertiser uploads video in a square or horizontal format for feed, we can automatically transform it into the full-screen vertical format of Stories.
Third: making our ads more relevant and effective. We're building new products and improving existing ones to ensure advertisers can reach the right audience. For example, automatic placements help advertisers get better results by showing ads across our platform wherever they'll perform best and at the lowest cost. SumUp, a German payment start-up that helps small businesses accept debit and credit cards, switched from manual to automatic placements and increased sales by 34% in one week.
Advertisers of all sizes want to know if their ads are working and how to make them better, but smaller businesses don't always have this capability. We're changing that. Last year, we introduced Test and Learn, a way for advertisers to run variations of their ads and measure the results in just a few steps. We started with tools for direct response advertisers to figure out what drives conversions.
In Q2, we added a way for companies to understand the effect of their ads on brand perception. We plan to roll this out to all advertisers, big and small, so they can easily experiment with different strategies and find the ones that work best.
As always, I'm grateful to our teams around the world. Their work over the past several months has helped millions of businesses grow and created new levels of transparency in advertising. I'd also like to thank our partners and the businesses of all sizes who turned to us to reach their customers and give us the feedback that helps make us better.
Thank you. And now, here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with our community metrics. Daily active users on Facebook reached 1.47 billion, up 11% compared to last year, led by growth in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. This number represents approximately 66% of the 2.23 billion monthly active users in Q2. MAUs were up 228 million or 11% compared to last year. It's worth noting that MAU and DAU in Europe were both down slightly quarter-over-quarter due to the GDPR roll out, consistent with the outlook we gave on the Q1 call.
As Mark mentioned, we're also introducing a family-wide audience metric, 2.5 billion people worldwide used one of our applications in June. This is our best estimate of our de-duplicated audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We believe this number better reflects the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of these services.
Note that, for comparison purposes, Facebook MAU does count multiple accounts for a single user when such accounts exist, and we estimate those represent approximately 10% of our Facebook MAU as previously disclosed in the limitation of key metrics section in our SEC filings. The family audience metric only counts a single user in these instances.
Turning now to the financials; all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $13.2 billion, up 42% or 38% on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange tailwinds contributed approximately $370 million of revenue in Q2. Q2 ad revenue was $13 billion, up 42% or 38% on a constant currency basis.
In terms of ad revenue by region, Europe and Asia-Pacific both grew fastest at 47% each and benefited from foreign exchange tailwinds. I'd note that European ad revenue growth decelerated more quickly than other regions and was impacted primarily by reduced currency tailwinds and, to a lesser extent, the roll out of GDPR.
Mobile ad revenue was $11.9 billion, up 50%, and represents approximately 91% of ad revenue. In Q2, the average price per ad increased 17% and the number of ad impressions served across our services increased 21%, driven primarily by ads in feed on Instagram and Facebook. Payments and other fees revenue was $193 million, up 23%.
Turning now to expenses; total expenses were $7.4 billion, up 50%. We ended Q2 with over 30,000 full-time employees, up 47% compared to last year. Operating income was $5.9 billion, representing a 44% operating margin. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 13%.
Net income was $5.1 billion or $1.74 per share. Capital expenditures were $3.5 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. In Q2, we generated $2.8 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with approximately $42 billion in cash and investments. And, in the second quarter, we bought back approximately $3.2 billion of our Class A common stock.
Turning now to the revenue outlook; our total revenue growth rate decelerated approximately 7 percentage points in Q2 compared to Q1. Our total revenue growth rates will continue to decelerate in the second half of 2018, and we expect our revenue growth rates to decline by high-single digit percentages from prior quarters sequentially in both Q3 and Q4.
There are several factors contributing to that deceleration. For example, we expect currency to be a slight headwind in the second half versus the tailwinds we have experienced over the last several quarters. We plan to grow and promote certain engaging experiences like Stories that currently have lower levels of monetization, and we are also giving people who use our services more choices around data privacy, which may have an impact on our revenue growth.
Turning now to expenses; we continue to expect that full-year 2018 total expenses will grow in the range of 50% to 60% compared to last year. In addition to increases in core product development and infrastructure, this growth is driven by increasing investment in areas like safety and security, AR/VR, marketing, and content acquisition. Looking beyond 2018, we anticipate that total expense growth will exceed revenue growth in 2019.
Over the next several years, we would anticipate that our operating margins will trend towards the mid-30s on a percentage basis. We expect full-year 2018 capital expenditures will be approximately $15 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. We plan to continue to grow capital expenditures beyond 2018 to support global growth and our ongoing product needs.
Turning now to tax; at current stock prices, we expect our full-year 2018 tax rate will be in the mid-teens, but that our Q3 tax rate will be 25% to 30% due to a one-time charge related to a recent court ruling in the IRS versus Altera case. As a reminder, fluctuations in our stock price will impact our tax price.
In summary, our community and business growth remain solid. Our financial strength has enabled us to invest heavily to improve our ability to serve our global community through our family of apps as well as to prepare us for the future.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. Two. Just the first one on monetization of Facebook core versus Instagram; can you talk a little bit about how you think about monetization levels and the key drivers currently and, going forward, when we think about ad load, pricing and the importance of ad improvements across the two platforms over the next, call it, year or so?
And the second one on Instagram TV, maybe just talk about how you look at – think about the core consumer offering, how it varies from Facebook Watch and, philosophically, how you think about investing in premium content or sports content across these two products. Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Brian, I'll take the first one. In terms of Facebook versus Instagram, they're obviously both contributing to revenue growth. Instagram is growing more quickly and making an increasing contribution to growth. And we've been pleased with how Instagram is growing. Facebook and Instagram are really one ads ecosystem. I think, from a supply perspective, both now from a feed perspective are at similar ad loads. Instagram has more heavy usage of Stories, so that's an area of continued growth opportunity because the effective levels of monetization in Stories are lower.
On the demand side, we see a good traction across both platforms, and we're rolling out more ability for advertisers to leverage ads in Stories with more formats and the like. So that's, again, an important opportunity for growth is just continuing to build out more products on the demand side for Stories.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
And I can take the second part of the question about the – what we're trying to do with IGTV and Watch at the same time. The IGTV product approach is very focused on helping people connect with creators in a mobile-native vertical video format and helping people not only see content that they love from people that they want to follow, but build a community around those creators, which is what we see people are trying to do. And creators now uniquely have the ability to both reach a large audience and connect and engage the community through the social network on Instagram at the same time.
With Watch, a lot of what we're trying to do is make it so the video content that's on Facebook and some of the content that we're acquiring through original programming that people can come together with their friends to watch that content through things like Watch Party and engage and build community that way.
So there's a big space here in terms of helping people have real connections and interactions around video. These are two different takes on this. Overall, what you're going to see from us on video is not just try to optimize for overall watch time, but to optimize for building products that help bring people together and help facilitate real interactions between people.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe going back to the OpEx and your comments, Dave, looking out sort of medium to longer term, just wanted to understand if we can get a little bit more color on some of the drivers of that. How much of it could be video in support of where you want to take the business over the medium and long term versus things that maybe don't necessarily have a revenue component to them like the security and the protection of the ecosystem that the whole team has been talking about since the end of last year? Thanks so much.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah, Eric, it's going to be a combination of those factors. I would say we're going to continue to invest in core product development and infrastructure. And so, you've seen that already in terms of the ramp that we have in capital expenditures. We're continuing to build out features and functionality for the community across a wide range of different products, whether it be the ad products that Sheryl talked about or IGTV and the like.
In addition to those core developments, we're also making the significant long-term investments in safety and security. Those investments are in the billions of dollars per year. Those will have a negative impact on margins. We think that's the right thing to do for the business in terms of ensuring the community's safety and security and the durability of the franchise. So those are important investments from an ROI perspective, but they don't have, obviously, immediate translation into revenue dollars.
Secondly, we're continuing to make big investments in innovation. Those, we believe, are attractive long-term investments. The things that I would point to are things like AI as well as our investments in AR and VR. Those are things that will play out – AI in the near-term, but the investments in AR and VR are really about building the next generation of computing, and that's got a longer-term return window. So, attractive investments we believe, but ones that will take longer-term to pay off, and those would have a dilutive effect on margins in the near-term. Those are the two factors that I would point to.
In addition, on the CapEx side, we're continuing to invest heavily on capital expenditures, first, to just get ahead of user growth and engagement and then also to make sure that we've got the compute available to support the growth of a number of the key drivers of our business around feed ranking and ads ranking. So, I think those are the things that I would point to, all factoring into the margin guidance that I gave.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your next question is from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Can you hear me?
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yes.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Can you guys hear me?
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yes.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yes.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Sorry. Dave, I think you said that the quarter-on-quarter growth rates are going to be high-single digits lower than the prior-year quarter-on-quarter growth rates versus 3Q and 4Q. That would imply around a 20% year-on-year growth rate exiting fourth quarter. So just want to clarify, is that what you actually said? And if so, what's driving this fairly dramatic deceleration in revenue growth?
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Ross, so, yes, so we grew at 42% in the current quarter and we would expect decel in the high-single digits for the next couple quarters. In terms of what is driving the deceleration, it's a combination of factors, and I think I outlined those in my commentary. First of all, there's the currency, which is going from being a tailwind to being a modest headwind, we expect.
Secondly, we're going to be focusing on growing engaging new experiences like Stories and promoting those. And that's going to have a negative impact on revenue growth. And then, finally, we're giving people who use the services more choice around privacy, and that's coming both in terms of impacts that could be ongoing from things like GDPR as well as other product options that we're providing that could have an impact on revenue growth. So it's a combination of all those factors that is leading to the deceleration of revenue growth in the second half.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. A question for Mark. I was hoping you could talk about the company's focus on meaningful social interactions. Several months into some of those changes, do you think behavior on platform has shifted at all? And would you expect the improvements in the experience to ultimately drive a rebound in core Facebook engagement? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So, we've launched a number of changes that are focused towards trying to encourage more interaction at the expense of some passive consumption on the network. And we found that these have generally encouraged more interaction or positives, so we're going to keep on moving in this direction.
We're doing this for a number of reasons. One is that we just started getting a lot of feedback from people in the community that they wanted Facebook to be more about connecting with people, which is really the core of what it's always been, less so about viral videos or news content and just passive consumption. So that's one.
Another big driver is we've focused on trying to make sure that we understand the effects of using our services on people's well-being. That's important for all companies. And the research there is very clear that when people are using the Internet, and including our services, to interact with other people, that's associated with all the positive elements of well-being that you'd expect: feeling more connected, feeling less lonely, feeling happier, and long-term measures of health but when you're simply using the Internet to passively consume content that isn't necessarily associated with positive improvements to well-being.
So, both because of the feedback that we were getting and the research, we felt like this was really the right direction to go in. We're seeing positive signs in terms of how it's encouraging people to interact more. Of the usage on the platform, we do think that that is the most valuable usage, but that's why we're going in that direction. And everything that we've seen so far suggests to us that we should continue moving in that direction more.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. And, Mark, thank you for all the detailed commentary in the beginning. I was just wondering if you could share with us, as you look ahead over the next 12 to 24 months and you think of assets that you have that you aren't currently monetizing in material ways, which of those do you think about – when you think about kind of layering on the next leg of the stool, if you will, which one of those would you expect us or would you expect to see start to contribute in a more meaningful way over the next couple of years? How would you rank order those assets that are not currently being monetized in a significant way at this point? Thank you.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
I'll take it. So, obviously, we started with ads in Facebook, and that was something we have grown and they continue to grow. The ads have expanded quite nicely to Instagram, and Instagram represents a very healthy part of the growth and we expect that to continue as well. When you think about things that are further out, I think you then start talking about our messaging apps.
We are furthest ahead in Messenger, but it's still very early days. We're quite happy with consumer engagement with 1.3 billion monthly actives on the platform, and we continue to see a lot of organic connections between businesses and consumers on the messaging platform. We now have over 8 billion messages sent between people and businesses per month, which includes automated messages. We're being very slow and deliberate with monetization. It's still in early days. But I think we've launched some things that people are excited about and interested in like click-to-Messenger ads.
We also have some early nice results we can share from clients. One of them recently was LEGO. They launched a Messenger bot to help with gift recommendations, and they created a click-to-Messenger ads that link to a LEGO bot which helped provide product and gift recommendations.
They reached people over 25 years old in the U.S., UK, France and Germany, and targeted people who are interested in LEGO toys and shopping, and they found a 3.4 times higher return on ad spend for click-to-Messenger ads versus those that just linked to the LEGO website. And I share that case because it shows what we're excited about. We're excited about a new surface where businesses can interact with consumers, but also really a new functionality.
If you go further out, you would then start thinking about WhatsApp. We are very focused there on the user experience, but we're also focused even earlier stages on growing our business ecosystem. The WhatsApp Business app has launched, and we now have more than 3 million people actively using it to test business solutions. So that's further out, but we think it has potential as well.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Two questions, please; a near term one and a long term one. The near term one is can you just comment on what you're seeing in terms of MAU recovery growth trends in Europe? You haven't – you gave us what turned out to be a pretty accurate read into the June quarter, so do you have a read into whether things have based out and started to improve again post GDPR implementation?
And then, I know, Sheryl, you just talked about this, but can I just ask you to just maybe comment a little bit more on Facebook Messenger? I've just seen the ad units there. They seem to be – there seemed like there's been a pickup recently in implementation of ads there that seemed to me to be highly effective and reasonably well targeted. So any learnings just from those, the basic ad units that you put in there beyond the – kind of the business metrics you just reported on? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Hey, Mark. It's Dave. On Europe, yeah, we don't have any update on trends. We had indicated in the first quarter that we would expect to see a decline. We're not providing any guidance on MAU and DAU in Europe on this call.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
In terms of number two, we have an ad model where we're able to use the targeting capabilities for Facebook. But when we put ads into a new surface, we obviously learn and evolve. So, one example of some of the things that we're excited about, again, are the click-to-Messenger ads. That's something we can put in News Feed in Instagram and Messenger and it both grows the ecosystem and creates a new opportunity for interaction.
We also have inbox ads where we're enabling advertisers to extend their reach to people in Messenger, which is still really early. And we're also in the early days of sponsored messages, which enable businesses to reengage people once a conversation has started. And so, when we think about the format of Messenger, we think about the direct correspondence between a person, either an existing or a potential client or with a business, and we think there are many times in kind of a life cycle of interacting with a business where that's a very attractive opportunity.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. Mark or Sheryl, could you discuss your view about the importance of Instagram as a discovery platform for new and/or emerging brands and merchants? And then, over time, as these merchants and brands mature, how do you view Instagram's ability to monetize? And then just a quick one on North American ad revenue; it was a bit lower than we expected in the second quarter. Don't know if you guys have any color there. Thank you.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On the first, when we think about Instagram, we think we have a great opportunity; 25 million Instagram business profiles, 2 million advertisers. We're growing quite nicely across brand and DR. And with 1 billion active people on the platform, I think Instagram is definitely both a direct response opportunity but an opportunity for discovery. Part of it's the format. The format is so visually appealing and people are telling stories with pictures, so we see both anecdotally and in the data that this is a great place for people to become aware of a product in the first place. And we see a lot of small businesses really able to do things on the platform.
I'll share a recent example. We just launched a shopping experience that was just expanded in Q2 to all consumers in an additional 45 countries. DefShop is an e-commerce fashion brand in Germany. They were an early tester for IG Shopping. And what they did in that test is tag each article of clothing. They had 56% more website visitors and a 64% increase in sales for tagged products. And I think a lot of those were discovered and purchased right through that advertising funnel.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
John, its Dave. Just on the North American deceleration in ad revenue growth, kind of consistent with the trends we've seen, so nothing there notable. I would say we're pleased at the growth that we're seeing at the scale at which we're operating. When you look at the deceleration, the one that I called out was really Europe where you saw the currency impact as well as, to a lesser extent, GDPR causing sort of faster deceleration than in the other regions. I would say North America was more kind of within kind of what we're seeing across the rest of the business.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. The guidance for the deceleration might raise some questions just on Facebook engagement. So just wondering how you're seeing activity within just core Facebook right now? Is it growing at a healthy rate? And then, secondly, you have had a couple of months now with GDPR. Just wondering how you're thinking about how that will impact your ad targeting over the next year. Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, Justin. I'll take that. So we're continuing to see good growth in the Facebook ecosystem with 11% DAU growth. And obviously, we've got broader family growth as well. In terms of, I guess, going to the GDPR question, we've talked about – oh, sorry. Sheryl, were you going to take the GDPR question?
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah, I can talk about GDPR. GDPR has not had a revenue impact, but we also recognize it wasn't fully rolled out this quarter. It was very encouraging for us to see that the vast majority of people affirmed that they want us to use information, including from the websites they visit, to make their ads more relevant. But, as we look further out, we recognize that there's still risk, and we're going to watch closely.
Advertisers are still adapting to the changes, so it's early to know the longer-term impact. And things like GDPR and other privacy changes that may happen from us or may happen with regulation could make ads more relevant. One thing that we know that's not going to change is that advertisers are always looking for the highest ROI opportunity. And what's most important in winning budget is our relative performance in the industry, and we believe we'll continue to do very well on that.

Your next question...
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
I'll give a little bit more color – sorry. I wanted to give a little bit more color on some of the different regional trends we're seeing on Facebook DAU. U.S. and Canada, sort of consistent with past quarters, has been flat at about 185 million, and we would expect that to continue to bounce around. Europe, we saw the declines that we anticipated from GDPR. And I would say there, really, those impacts were purely due to the GDPR impact, not other engagement trends. So I would point to that. Otherwise, I think feeling good about Europe.
Worldwide, we've got kind of different puts and takes. Indonesia had a SIM card registration requirement that caused a little bit of a headwind in APAC. And then rest of world, we saw some countries come back online like Ethiopia came back online. So some different puts and takes, but overall, still seeing regional growth across all regions with the exception of the U.S./Canada being flat.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Just following up on the comments, Sheryl mentioned that there's really no meaningful impact on GDPR to the ad business, at least as of now. But then, Dave, I think you mentioned that because you're giving people more control over their privacy and data that this is one of the reasons why you're expecting the meaningful decel in the second half; so just trying to recognize those two things. Maybe the questions have been too specific around the impact of GDPR and should be more broad around data and privacy? And I guess, ultimately, the question is what impact, if any, these greater controls that you're giving users having on ad revenue growth and monetization? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, Mark. Let me take that. So GDPR didn't have a significant impact in Q2, partially because of its implementation date. So you're just seeing effectively one month of it in terms of revenue. We do think that there will be some modest impact, and I don't want to overplay these factors, but you've got a couple of things going on. You've got the impact of the opt-outs. And while we're very pleased with the vast majority of people opting into the third-party data use, some did not. So that will have a small impact on revenue growth. And then we're seeing some impact from how advertisers are using their own data for targeting. So, again, that will have a modest impact on growth.
And then in addition, we're continuing to focus our product development around putting privacy first and that's going to, we believe, have some impact on revenue growth. So it's really a combination of kind of how we're approaching privacy as well as GDPR and the like. So I think all of those factors together are one of the factors that we're talking about; the other being, obviously, the currency flip.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield from BTIG.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess one of the things as you look at, you talked about the growth you're seeing in users overseas or basically everywhere but the U.S. and Canada. But when you look at ARPU, your ARPU outside, even in Europe, is still only a real tiny fraction of where you are in the U.S. and, obviously in Asia and rest of world, an infinitesimal fraction of where you are in the U.S.
How does that factor into as you think about your long-term guidance that you just talked about, especially with margins moving towards the mid-30s, just given how early you are in those non-U.S. markets and how much headroom they have to grow as those ad markets mature. How do you have confidence that you, in that type of deceleration, when you look at how much upside there is in that ARPU?
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah, I guess you've got a couple of different factors going on there. You've got the opportunity, I think, for ARPU growth in those regions, and that's going to depend on the mix of countries in those regions and the GDP per capita in those countries as well as the relative size of the ad markets. And that correlates very strongly to our opportunity and our potential ARPU. And I think you've got upside growth potential in the long run in those markets.
As it relates to margin profile, you also just have the factor that you're increasing growth – the increasing mix of the business is shifting towards Asia and towards what are currently lower ARPU markets. And so, while those are very attractive, we believe, to serve both in the near and in the long run, they're going to have a different impact on margin because the cost to support those users relative to the revenue they bring in does have an impact on margins in the medium-term.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Evercore.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Thank you. I have two; one for Sheryl and one for Mark. Sheryl, in Dave's comments and the comments about the business impact of engagement shifting to Stories versus feed products, if you could spell out for us I guess the specific reasons why Stories monetization is not as strong as feed today and in the context perhaps of what needs to happen in the future for Stories monetization to rebound to, let's say, parity to where feed is today and sort of get through that negative impact.
And then, for Mark, I think perhaps Heather was getting at this in her question, but the company's investing so much into owned data centers. You talked about that I think in your prepared remarks. Are there ways to improve the return on investment of those investments in data center servers, network infrastructure? And what I'm thinking is in order to perhaps service third-parties to maybe just improve those returns in the way that other tech and Internet companies have in terms of investments in infrastructure. Thank you.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
So, on Stories, we've seen great progress with Stories as a format for people to share on our platforms. We have 400 million people sharing with Instagram Stories, 450 million with WhatsApp Status. Facebook is newer, but we're seeing good progress there. The question is will this monetize at the same rate as News Feed? And we honestly don't know. We'll have to see what happens. There are good reasons to be very optimistic about the monetization. The opportunity, full-screen, authentic, very engaging, different format than feed, gives us an opportunity to grow.
We also don't have all of our advertisers yet creating story ads. So, obviously, as more and more advertisers come in and do that, the more and the better ads we'll have. I think getting that ramp will take a while because Stories is a new format, and we definitely see that it takes a while for advertisers to adopt new formats.
I think one of the other things we feel good about over the long run, not really the short run, is that since we have so many different places where you have Stories formats in Instagram and WhatsApp and Facebook, as volume increases of the opportunity, advertisers get more interested. But we won't know for a while if it's going to monetize at the same rate. We do feel very good about a new and very engaging opportunity for ads.

Your next question...
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
And I can quickly answer the second part around data centers. I mean the quick answer is that we're not planning on going in to the cloud services. We're not planning on doing that. We have to build out all this capacity to serve our community. It's a very computationally and resource-intensive set of services that we provide and we need to build that out.
We are very optimistic. I'm very optimistic about AI overall and being able to use more computing resources to be able to crunch more data to be able to rank News Feed and ads and search and friend suggestions, and all the important things that we use our AI systems to do in addition to the integrity and security work. Part of the advance in AI technology now allows us to use more compute to use all the data that's in the system to provide better results, so we certainly plan on doing that.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks. One for Sheryl and then one for Dave. Sheryl, just on the SMB side, wondering if you could give us any color by region, if possible. And then secondly, on the go-to-market strategy, to what extent is Facebook dependent upon or leveraging resellers versus small businesses discovering the ad platform on their own? How key is that reseller channel for you on the small business side? And then, for Dave, given that you've given us some kind of relatively specific guidance on the revenue growth decel through the remainder of the year, I'm wondering if you could give us some color on what that embeds from an FX expectation at this point. Thank you very much.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
So SMBs are very core to our business and, with over 80 million SMB pages that are using Facebook on a monthly basis, we know they're core to theirs. Our 6 million advertisers come from those pages, and so the fact that we have so much room to grow is exciting for us. We don't break this out by region, but we do see very strong SMB participation across the board and around the world, particularly as SMBs come online, the more. So, you can imagine that some of it goes with Internet penetration and Internet use.
In terms of resellers, we think it's a big opportunity. We don't break that out either. But, obviously, some of our ads are sold directly and bought directly through our online interfaces. We also have third-parties that sell our ads and we welcome that as well.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Peter, its Dave. Just on the FX, we're just looking at current rates and just rolling those forward, not predicting what the rates will be, but rather looking at current rates and thus what the impact would be if rates stay the same on the second half.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies.
Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Dave, I want to go back to the magnitude of the deceleration. I think many investors are having a hard time reconciling that type of deceleration considering how good the advertiser feedback is on your platform. And I realize you've outlined FX and Stories and the other factors, but is there something that you're hearing now from advertisers that is giving you more confidence that they're seeing something different about what we're all hearing right now? It just seems like the magnitude is beyond anything we've seen, especially across a number of tech names we all cover.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. Brent, I'll take that. And if Sheryl wants to add color, she should step in as well. This is consistent – we consistently have seen over last eight quarters constant currency deceleration. So, there's a continuation of this trend. I don't think there's anything beyond that in the factors that I outlined.
I would note we've been benefiting from continued growth across Instagram. Instagram ad load in feed is at the same level as Facebook, so that would be – that's certainly been helpful in our recent quarters. So I think when you look at the factors going forward, I would say we've got the currency impact, we've got some of the impacts around privacy and the like, but we continue to get good advertiser feedback on ROI. We continue to believe we're delivering great ROI for advertisers. So I don't think there's anything from the advertiser perspective that's necessarily playing out differently than expectations. Sheryl can add any color there.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah, I'd add there. Even at decreasing growth rates, we are still growing and predicting growth at very healthy rates, and that's based on returning for advertisers. We're very focused on helping advertisers meet their ultimate goals, looking at their ROI, looking at the return they get on ringing the cash register, whether that cash register rings online or offline. And we hear from them and we continue to see in our results that we continue to deliver strong results. So we have a lot of opportunity ahead of us. We're going to continue investing in that opportunity. And what we're hearing from advertisers all over the world is that they want to continue to grow and invest with us as well.

The last question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Robert W. Baird.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks. Just a couple of follow ups for me. First off, Dave, maybe I missed this, but what timeframe are you referring to in terms of getting down to the mid-30s operating margin? And does that outlook assume any meaningful contribution from any of the new areas of innovation that you highlighted on the call? Just trying to figure out how much of that might be more conservatism.
And then, on the near-term trends and the midterm elections in the U.S., given the amount of scrutiny that will exist in your platform, how should we think about your level of preparation on one hand to manage content? And then, on the other hand, is this part of the potential impact on monetization revenue growth in the back half of the year that you're taking into consideration? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, Collin. Let me take a crack at that. So, in terms of the guidance, I've given guidance. This is several years, so more than two but less than many. So it's over a timeframe more than two years is our expectation. And then in terms of does that have any meaningful contribution from areas of innovation, we talked about some of the areas that we're investing in. Obviously, on the safety and security side, those are costs that are layering in that we think are the right thing to do for the business but don't necessarily have a revenue impact. So it certainly takes those into account.
It also takes into account the ongoing investments we're making in the longer-term innovation work, which I don't think will necessarily have any meaningful revenue relative to the size of the business in those time frames. We're also investing in things like video, Watch and the like, which have the potential to condition tribute on the revenue side, but still relatively small in perspective of the overall business.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
All right. And I can take the question on the midterm elections. So, yes, the short answer is that we're much more confident that we're going to get this right for the elections in the 2018, which include the U.S. midterms, but also the elections in Brazil and upcoming elections in early-2019 in India and the EU. And the reason why we're confident that we can get this right is because there have been several elections since the 2016 ones that have had much better results, including the French presidential election, the German elections, the Alabama special election, and the Mexican election about a month ago.
And in each of these – going back to 2016, we were – we have a very big security team that was focused on security around even the 2016 election and we found hacking and phishing attacks that the Russian government was trying to do, and we notified the right people about those. But 2016 was really the first time that we saw this kind of coordinated information operation. And since then, we've built the playbook out that has included building AI tools to identify thousands of fake accounts and groups and pages that violate the policies. It's included growing the security and content review teams to 20,000 people to be able to handle the volume of work that we need to do. And it includes a lot of the transparency work around advertising in general, but also the political and issue ads archive and verifying all advertisers who are trying to run political and issue ads.
There are a number of other things that we're doing too, including creating an external program for independent academics to study how the impact of social media and how foreign governments try to interfere in elections. And that will have a longer-term impact as well. But the short answer here is we've been very focused on this. 2018 is a big year. And because of the successful results that we've seen in a number of elections recently, we feel like our road map and our level of preparation is much higher now than it has been. And we feel relatively confident going into these elections.

Good afternoon. My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. This call will be recorded. Thank you very much.
Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook's Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.
Deborah Crawford - Facebook, Inc.
Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's press release and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we may present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Despite facing important challenges, our community and business are off to a strong start in 2018. More than 2.2 billion people now use Facebook every month, and more than 1.4 billion people use it every day. Our business grew 49% year-over-year to $12 billion. But as you know, we have important issues to address.
For most of our existence, we've focused on all the good that connecting people can bring. But it's clear now we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well, whether that's foreign interference in elections, fake news, hate speech, or app developers and data privacy. So now, we're going through every part of our relationship with people and making sure we're taking a broad enough view of our responsibility, not just to build tools, but to make sure those tools are used for good. This means continuing to invest heavily in safety, security and privacy.
Some of this will come in the form of new technology. We're restricting that data developers can access. We're building advanced AI tools that have helped us detect and remove tens of thousands of fake accounts ahead of the elections in France, Germany and Alabama last year. We're investing more in people. We are doubling our team working on security and content review to more than 20,000 people by the end of this year, and this includes content reviewers with specific language skills to detect hate speech in places like Myanmar. We're also working to protect political discourse by making ads more transparent.
We recently announced that from now on we will require everyone running political and issue ads or running a large page to be verified with a government ID. And we're also starting to roll out ads transparency tools that bring our ads to an even higher standard of transparency than TV or print ads. You'll be able to see who is running a political ad, who they're targeting, how much they're paying, and what other messages they're sending to different people. And we're going to get this done in time for the 2018 U.S. midterm as well as upcoming elections in Mexico, Brazil, India, Pakistan and more.
We have a responsibility to keep our community safe and secure, and we're going to invest heavily to do that. At the same time, we also have a responsibility to keep moving forward and keep building tools that bring people together in meaningful new ways. That's what makes Facebook so important to so many people and that's our responsibility too.
I'm proud that more than 2 billion people use our services to stay connected with the people that matter to them most. In just the last several months, we've seen the #metoo movement and the March for Our Lives, organized, at least in part, on Facebook. We've seen people come together after Hurricane Harvey to raise more than $20 million for relief, and we've seen more than 80 million small businesses use Facebook to grow and create jobs.
That's why beyond the investments we're making to secure our platform, we're going to invest even more in building the experiences that bring people together on Facebook in the first place. Over the next three years, we're going to keep building Facebook to not only be a service that people love to use, but also one that's good for people and good for society.
Last quarter, we shared our well-being research into the good and bad uses of technology that showed that when you use the internet to interact and build relationships that's correlated with greater long-term well-being and greater health and happiness over time. But when you're just passively watching videos or news online, that's not as positive.
This quarter, we've continued shifting from passive consumption to encouraging meaningful interaction. It's still early, but we're starting to see some signs that this is working. Some types of sharing are increasing even as passive consumption of video is down. And at the same time, we're rolling out more interactive video features like Watch Party that let you watch video with your friend. This is something we can uniquely do and the feedback on it so far is great.
Groups is also a major focus for us. This quarter, we announced that 200 million people are now members of meaningful groups on Facebook. Now we just need to keep doubling that for the next few years to reach our goal of helping 1 billion people belong to meaningful groups. As membership in physical groups continues declining as it has for decades, we hope helping people connect online will help strengthen our society's social fabric.
Stories is also a big part of the future of video sharing, which is why we're all in on it across our family. Instagram was the first to really take off here, Facebook started slower, but is now growing quickly, too, and WhatsApp Status is by far the biggest of views products and continues to grow quickly. There's also a clear trend towards sharing with smaller groups, which is why messaging is so important. Between WhatsApp and Messenger, people now send almost 100 billion messages every day. They also do more than 3 billion minutes of video and voice calling every day, making us by far the largest network for video calling as well.
Over the next five years, we're focused on building out the business ecosystems around our apps like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. This quarter, we released WhatsApp Business, which lets small businesses create a presence and offers better tools for messaging. And in just a few months more than 3 million people are actively using WhatsApp Business. It's a hit and it's growing quickly.
One of the interesting opportunities and challenges over the coming years will be making sure that ads are as good in Stories as they are in feeds. If we don't do this well, then as more sharing shifts to Stories, that could hurt our business. But there's real upside here, too, if we do a good job. And we're leading the way here with Instagram, and the results so far are promising both on product quality and business performance.
Over the next 10 years, we're continuing to work on the long-term technology that we need to break down barriers and bring the world closer together. We continue to work on connectivity and our Internet.org efforts have now helped almost 100 million people get access to the Internet who may not have had it otherwise.
AI is the most important technological trend right now and I'm optimistic that it can help us amplify the good that's happening on our services as well as proactively remove harmful content. For example, one thing that I'm proud of is our AI tools that help us take down ISIS and Al Qaeda related terror content, with 99% of that content being removed before any person flags it to us.
We've also built AI tools that have flagged when people are posting thoughts about suicide. And these tools have helped us reach out to first responders to get over 1,000 people the help they need quickly.
On the positive side, AI will help us understand the context of what people are sharing so we can help encourage more connection and conversations between people as well.
And finally, we have some big moments for virtual reality coming up, and I'm excited to get Oculus Go in people's hands soon.
Overall, 2018 is a year of important investment to keep people safe and also to keep building the experiences people expect from us. We are taking a broader view of our responsibility and investing to make sure our tools are used for good.
And we also need to keep moving forward, building new tools to help people connect, build community and bring the world closer together. Thanks to all of you for being a part of this journey. I'm looking forward to making more progress together.
Now, here's Sheryl to talk about our business.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Hi, everyone. Before going through our results, I want to take a minute to talk about ads and privacy. At Facebook, we have always built privacy protections into our ad system. We use the information you provide and that we receive from websites to target ads for advertisers, but we don't tell them who you are. We don't sell your information to advertisers or anyone else.
We also believe that people should control their advertising experience. For every ad we show, there's an option to find out why you're seeing that ad and to turn off ads from that advertiser entirely. And you can opt out of being targeted based on certain information, like the websites you visit or your relationship status.
Advertising and protecting people's information are not at odds. We do both. Targeted ads that respect people's privacy are better ads. They show people things that they're more likely to be interested in. We regularly hear from people who use Facebook that they prefer to see ads that are relevant to them and their lives.
Effective advertising is also critical to helping businesses grow. This is especially important for small businesses who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford to buy broad reach media. As Mark shared, we now have more than 80 million small businesses around the world using Facebook pages and many of them are building their businesses on Facebook.
Small businesses are the backbone of local communities and create the majority of jobs around the world and their growth creates millions of new jobs. We surveyed small businesses in 18 countries, and more than half of SMBs on Facebook say they've been able to hire more people due to growth in demand since joining our platform.
Last month, I was in Houston for Facebook's Community Boost event. I met Patrice Farooq, who runs a small business called Cupcake Kitchen. After Hurricane Harvey damaged her business last year, she used Facebook to find new customers. Now more than half her business come from Facebook and she's getting ready to open a second store.
We're proud of the ad model we've built. It ensures that people see more useful ads, allows millions of businesses to grow and enables us to provide a global service that's free for all to use. The fastest way to bridge the digital divide in the United States or around the world is by offering services free to any consumer regardless of their circumstance. Advertising supported businesses like Facebook equalize access and improve opportunity.
At the same time, we know that people want control over how their information is used, and we want them to feel confident that the ads they're seeing are authentic. That's why we're building industry-leading transparency tools. This includes a way to see ads an advertiser is running, even if they aren't targeted to you. This new feature is live in Canada and will roll out in Ireland and the U.S. soon.
In the coming months, GDPR will give us another opportunity to make sure people fully understand how their information is used by our services. It's an EU regulation, but as Mark said a few weeks ago, we're going to extend these controls to everyone who uses Facebook regardless of where in the world they live. Our commitment to you is that we will continue to improve our ads model by strengthening privacy and choice, while giving businesses of all sizes new and better tools to help them grow.
With that, I'd like to turn to our results. It was a great quarter for our business. Q1 ad revenue grew 50% year-over-year. Mobile ad revenue was $10.7 billion, up 60% from last year and contributed approximately 91% of total ad revenue. Revenue growth was broad-based across regions, marketer segments and verticals.
We continue to make progress on our three priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing new ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, leveraging the power of mobile. Advertisers recognize the importance of reaching their audience on mobile. During the Super Bowl this year, over 90% of national TV advertisers were also advertising on Facebook. This shows that the largest advertisers understand the value of broad-based campaigns with us.
Take Tourism Australia. To get more Americans interested in visiting Australia, they ran ads on Facebook and Instagram in the week leading up to the game. On Super Bowl Sunday, they ran short video ads on Facebook before their big TV spot at halftime. This drove 22% incremental reach on top of TV and a 35 point lift in awareness. During the campaign, 50% of leads on the Tourism Australia site came from Facebook.
Second, developing new ad products. Instagram Stories is changing how people share and express themselves. Advertisers are also finding creative ways to use the format. This quarter, we made carousel ads available in Stories so advertisers can share up to three images or videos per ad instead of just one. People can swipe up on the ads to visit the advertiser's website.
We also announced a number of innovations to help retailers reach customers. We rolled out a more personalized shopping experience in News Feed. Now when people click on a collection ad, they'll see a full-screen catalog organized according to their interests.
We also introduced a new way to reach people before they've shown interest in making a specific purchase. If someone is generally interested in furniture, a business can now run ads focused on different categories of their products, such as couches or tables, to inspire them to shop.
And last, making our ads more relevant and effective. Our investments in measurement are helping advertisers of all sizes understand their results and make good investment decisions.
We've heard from many of our advertisers that they want third-party verification to prove that we're helping them achieve their marketing goals. We were recently accredited by the Media Ratings Council for News Feed served ad impressions on desktop and mobile. We're working with them on accreditation in other areas as well.
Going forward, we will continue to focus on these three priorities and ensure that people's privacy is protected on Facebook.
I want to close by thanking our teams around the world for the work they do each and every day and each and every quarter to make our company and our services better. I'm also truly grateful to our partners who work with us to grow their businesses.
Thanks, and now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Our community and business both showed solid growth in the first quarter. Let's start with our community metrics. Daily active users on Facebook reached 1.45 billion, up 13% compared to last year, led by user growth in India, Indonesia and Vietnam. This number represents approximately 66% of our 2.2 billion monthly active users in Q1. MAUs were up 260 million or 13% compared to last year.
Turning now to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $12 billion, up 49% or 42% on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange tailwinds contributed $536 million of revenue in Q1. Additionally, the adoption of ASC 606, the new revenue standard, resulted in approximately $130 million of incremental revenue in Q1 due to a change from net to gross accounting for our Instant Articles product.
Q1 total ad revenue was $11.8 billion, up 50% or 43% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue was $10.7 billion, up 60%. In Q1, the average price per ad increased 39%, and the number of ad impressions served increased 8%, driven primarily by feed ads on Facebook and Instagram. Payments and other fees revenue was $171 million, down 2%.
Turning to expenses, total expenses were $6.5 billion, up 39%. In Q1, we added over 2,600 employees, which was a record level of net new hires. We ended Q1 with over 27,700 full-time employees, up 48% compared to last year. We are focused on growing technical head count as well as a variety of other groups that support the business.
Operating income was $5.4 billion, representing a 46% operating margin. Our effective tax rate was 11%. Net income was $5 billion or $1.69 per share. Capital expenditures were $2.8 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. In Q1, we generated $5 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with approximately $44 billion in cash and investments.
In Q1, we bought back approximately $1.9 billion of our Class A common stock. Given our existing repurchase program is nearly fully executed, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $9 billion of stock.
Turning to our outlook, the changes that Mark and Sheryl described will, we believe, benefit our community and our business and will serve to strengthen Facebook overall. At the highest level, we believe that we can continue to build the great ads business while protecting people's privacy. That said, with regard to GDPR and other initiatives around data usage, while it's early and difficult to know the business implications in advance, we anticipate a couple of impacts.
First, as you might expect, we believe that European MAU and DAU may be flat to slightly down sequentially in Q2 as a result of the GDPR rollout. Second, while we do not anticipate these changes will significantly impact advertising revenue, there is certainly the potential for some impact and we will be monitoring this closely.
Importantly, GDPR affects the entire online advertising industry, so the Facebook specific impact is difficult to model in advance. In terms of our overall 2018 revenue outlook, we continue to anticipate revenue growth rates will decelerate on a constant currency basis throughout the year.
On the expense side, we are tightening our initial expense guidance range. We now expect that full year 2018 total expenses will grow 50% to 60% compared to our prior range of 45% to 60%. This narrowed range reflects the significant investments we're making in areas like safety and security, content acquisition and our long-term innovation efforts.
Turning to capital expenditures, we expect that our full year 2018 capital expenditures will be around $15 billion, at the high end of our prior range of $14 billion to $15 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. We also expect continued growth in capital expenditures beyond 2018 to support global growth and ongoing product improvements.
Turning now to tax, at current stock prices, we expect that our Q2 and full year 2018 tax rate will be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, fluctuations in our stock price will impact our tax rate.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrated the growth in our business and global community remains strong. We have a lot of work ahead and are investing aggressively to enhance safety, security and privacy, while also focusing on our mission of giving people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. One for Mark and one for Dave. Mark, so you focused on bringing people together and clearly have this massive platform with strong engagement, but can you talk about some of the business opportunities for Facebook on the platform away from advertising, and where you're most focused there?
And then Dave, just on the OpEx, can you talk about kind of more specifically where some of the incremental costs would fall that take the previous low end of the range here off the table, given what you've seen over the last couple months? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I could take the first question. So we think that ads is a great business model that is aligned with our mission. We want to build a service that can help connect everyone around the world, so we want to offer that service for free and have it be affordable, and that's completely aligned with what we're trying to do.
So even when we do other things, like we're running tests of payments, we have Marketplace which is growing and doing well, there may be other ways that we could think about making money from those, but in general our strategy is to offer those services at cost and make it so that businesses can bid what it is worth to them to run ads in the system. We think that that is both the most efficient way to run the business, it offers every business in the world the lowest prices that we can potentially offer, and it provides a great free service to people around the world.
I know that a lot of people have had questions about the business model, and this is something that I just think we at Facebook are very proud of. And we think that it is the right way to build a service that connects everyone around the world.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Hey, Doug. It's Dave. So if you recall, it's very consistent with what we've been talking about the last couple of quarters which is the acceleration of expense growth is really driven by three factors. So it's the investments that we're making in safety and security, it's the content investments we're making to support Watch, and then finally it's the innovation initiatives around our longer term bets like AI, AR, VR and connectivity.
So it's those three factors. If I had to point to what's really leading us to tighten the range, it's really the first factor which is the safety and security investments. Specifically, we're putting more behind that more quickly than we anticipated, and so that's where you're going to see it come up.
If you look at the current results from this quarter, you'll see that our sales and marketing expense grew 51% in the quarter – one of the – year-over-year. One of the factors driving that is that's where we're categorizing our community operations investment and other operations teams that support the quality initiatives and the safety initiatives. So you're already seeing some of that getting picked up in the quarter and you'll see that carry through in the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
Mark A. May - Citi Investment Research
Thank you. This question's probably aimed at Dave. You commented that you do not expect any significant, maybe some impact from the implementation of GDPR, yet you also voiced some uncertainty there. I guess the question is what gives you confidence in coming out now and saying that you expect no significant impact on the ad business, maybe some?
And then maybe more for Mark, there have been some recent reports that imply that even some seemingly simple things that Facebook may not be proactively identifying or addressing have come up and I guess the question is, is it that it's not as simple as it may seem, or is it that these reports aren't accurate, this just has to do with some of the sensitive data like social security information being showing up online? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Hey, Mark. It's Dave. So on GDPR, I think fundamentally we believe we can continue to build a great ads business while protecting the privacy of the people who use Facebook. As part of the rollout of GDPR, we're providing a lot of control to people around their ad settings and we're committed, as Sheryl and Mark mentioned, to providing those same controls worldwide.
And while we don't expect these changes will significantly impact advertising revenue, there's certainly potential for some impact. Any change of the ability for us and our advertisers to use data can impact our optimization potential at the margin, which could impact our ability to drive price improvements in the long run. So we'll just have to watch how that plays out over time.
I think it's important to note that GDPR is affecting the entire online advertising industry. And so what's really most important in winning budgets is our relative performance versus other opportunities presented to marketers. And that's why it will be important to watch kind of how this plays out at the industry level.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On the social security information, social security is not an input people put into Facebook and posts containing information like social security numbers or credit cards are not allowed on our site and we remove them as soon as we become aware of it. So we're continually working to improve these efforts and we encourage our community to report anything like this that they see, but that's not data that Facebook is collecting in any way.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question, maybe two if I can. Mark, in the changes you talked about at the product level at the beginning part of the year, as you've started to make those changes and some of the content people see on the platform has evolved, what does that mean for engagement? What are you seeing in terms of the way people are using Facebook? I know it's early days, but curious if you've seen anything in terms of change of behavior.
And then, Sheryl, we're starting to pick up from advertisers a lot of momentum and positive commentary on messaging platforms, especially Facebook Messenger. Wanted to know if you'd give us any color about your own conversations on the business side, on the messaging apps, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and how investors should think about the opportunity there. Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I can speak to the first point. So we made a number of changes and are still making changes to prioritize meaningful interactions between people over passive consumption of content. And that follows a lot of feedback directly from our community that people want Facebook to be more about friends and family and less about just content consumption. And it also follows the well-being research that we've done that suggests that when people use the Internet for interacting with people and building relationships, that is correlated with all of the positive measures of well-being that you just expect like longer term health and happiness, feeling more connected and less lonely, whereas just passively consuming content is not necessarily positive on those dimensions.
So we've been rolling out a number of changes, both product changes and ranking the News Feed. As I said in my opening remarks, that has increased or we've observed increases in some types of sharing and interaction between people based on that. We've also observed some continued declines as we've done this and in the passive consumption of video, specifically.
Overall, I'd say that these changes are doing what we expected that they would do and helping people to connect more and have more meaningful interactions. I think that that's the thing that people can uniquely do on Facebook that they can't do on other services that may be more about just consuming content.
So we think that this is going in the direction of building a stronger community and a stronger business over the long term, and we're optimistic about what we're seeing here.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On Messenger, we continue to be primarily focused on consumer growth and engagement, and we're being slow and deliberate with monetization. It's worth noting this isn't a feed product, so there are some more unknowns here.
But I think the potential is real and big and growing. We see a lot of organic connections between businesses and consumers, and our experience is that where are those – where we have those organic connections, that's very promising to turn that into monetization as well.
We have over 18 million businesses now communicating with their customers through Messenger. We have 2 billion messages sent between people and businesses a month, which includes automated messages.
And we're focused on launching new tools that help businesses use Messenger. For this quarter, we launched new quick replies for customers. We're seeing ads in inbox, which are now available to all advertisers.
It's really early, but nice pick up and nice buzz there. And click to Messenger ads on Facebook are actually very promising as well because advertisers want to see a return for the money they spend. And when they have an ad and they can get a direct contact one to one with a customer, that's been something that people are really excited about. So early days, but I think a lot of potential here.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Thank you. I'd like to follow-up a little bit on usage just because of the comments last quarter. Any update to the time spent trends on Facebook post your changes?
I guess, a second question is, do you think time spent on Facebook can start to grow again?
And then third, when you look holistically at Instagram, which seems to be doing really well in third-party services, how do you think about the whole platform in total, Facebook plus Instagram? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah, so I'll take that. In terms of time spent on Facebook, we're not providing a specific update on that. I would note that Mark talked about some of the changes we're making to focus on connections over consumption. So we're seeing a decrease in certain types of time spent such as passive video consumption as a result of that and an increase in areas like sharing. So, we're not really optimizing the business on time spent, but rather the kind of quality of conversations and connections.
So we're continuing to invest in that work, and we think it's the right thing for the Facebook community in the long run. And I think it's also good for overall engagement.
For Instagram, that continues to perform very well, not providing kind of a separate breakout of that, but Instagram continues to grow nicely, both as a – both from an engagement perspective and a business perspective.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could talk a little about Watch. I know it's early, but I was wondering if you could share with us your initial thoughts on how it's going versus your expectations? How you see it evolving over the next couple years? And ultimately, how would you define success for it as you look out? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So for Watch, the big thing that we're trying to do is help create new ways that people can connect, right? So it's very different from video and News Feed, the passive consumption that I'm talking about on response to some of the other questions because it's intentional, right? I mean, people go to it to watch specific content.
And we're trying to make a different experience than what you might be able to get on YouTube or any of these other services by making it more about connecting with people in different ways.
So a good example of this is what I talked about with Watch Party, where now people – groups of people can get together and can watch videos at the same time and you can interact around that. And we think that that's the kind of experience that we can uniquely build and that that's going to further our mission and just be a unique thing that we can add to the world.
So what we're seeing so far is that a bunch of the content that has come onto Watch is good and is working and people watch it. We're continuing to treat the product to emphasize that kind of content more while building more of these social features.
I'd say it's still pretty early overall in terms of the growth of this, but it's clearly an area that's important where I think we have something unique that we're going to bring to make this successful.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Just two questions. Dave, is the impression growth acceleration to 8% a function of easier comps or is it a function of some of the changes that Mark was talking about around the News Feed content that you put in in January?
And then is the North America ad revenue growth acceleration being driven by that, that change on core Facebook? Or is it more coming from Instagram? Any color there on those two accelerating trends would be great.
And then the last one is just a follow-up on the GDPR topic. Dave, you mentioned that MAUs and DAUs might be down a little bit in 2Q in Europe. Is that what you've seen already from these new screens that just came out with the new terms of service? Or is that just a guess of what you might see in the future? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So I think I'll take all of those, Ross. So the impression growth acceleration, you've got a couple factors going on there. One of the factors is just that the desktop roll-off is just continuing. So as it gets smaller, it has less of a depressive effect on the overall impression growth number, because if you recall, desktop has quite a number of impressions per DAU, just given it's the right-hand column that has multiple impressions on each screen. So that's one of the reasons. And obviously, Instagram is continuing to grow nicely as well, so that's another contributing factor there.
In terms of the North America revenue growth acceleration, one of the big factors there is really just also that's where you're picking up some of the accounting change from the Instant Articles going from net to gross, so that's contributing to that acceleration. Obviously, I'm very pleased with the strength of North American ad revenue and, overall, all the different regions, but that's a factor there, and IG is, obviously, contributing nicely to growth in North America and worldwide.
Finally, on the GDPR trend, that's just based on what we're expecting given that you're having to bring people through these consent flows, and we have been modeling it and expect there would be a flat to down impact on MAU and DAU. It's very early in our rollout, but nothing inconsistent with what we've been modeling. So that's why we're giving that indication of what we expect.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two; one for Dave and one for Mark. Dave, will the privacy policy or the opt-in process differ in Europe versus other geographies post GDPR? Your prepared remarks suggested that those controls would extend to the rest of the world. And if that is the case, why wouldn't we also potentially see an impact to MAU and/or DAU outside of just Europe? And then Mark, just simple question, having watched most of your testimony on Capitol Hill, I just wonder what did you learn, or what surprised you the most personally from that experience? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Do you want to take that, Sheryl?
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. On the GDPR changes, so we just started rolling out the GDPR controls in Europe and we're going to make all the same controls and settings available every way, which gives people the same opportunities to make the same choices. It's not going to be exactly the same format. It's going to be localized instead for different parts of the world. And so we think some of the differences will come from that.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
And on the testimony, these are important issues and I think that that was an important moment to be able to go and hear what people were wondering about and just to have a public hearing of answering all of the questions around Cambridge Analytica and what we knew and all the steps that we're taking on data privacy and developers to make sure that this doesn't happen again and to lay out all the different things that we're doing.
I mean, the hearings didn't just touch on that. They also touched on a number of the other issues that we face, including foreign interference in elections and that's something that we're incredibly focused on. 2018 is going to be an incredibly important year on this. There are big elections, not just the U.S. midterms, but the major elections upcoming in Mexico, in Brazil, in India, and Pakistan, and a number of other countries around the world. So this is important and it was an important moment for the company to hear the feedback and to show what we're doing. And now I think the important thing is that we execute on all the things that we need to do to make sure that we keep people safe.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak, your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. Two questions. First, you posted another strong quarter for ad growth. Just wondering given the recent events, has there been any change in kind of advertisers' views about the platform, or concerns about ROI going forward? And then second on video, was there much investment in video content in the first quarter, or do you expect the bulk of the video content spend to hit kind of through the rest of the year, and what types of content will you be investing in?
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
To the first, in the immediate days of the concern, we heard from a handful of advertisers who paused spend, one of whom has already come back, and we haven't seen a meaningful trend or anything much since then. Advertisers ask the same questions as people are, that they want to make sure their and their customers' data is protected, and I think we are able to answer those questions in a compelling way.
In terms of ROI on the platform, the ROI is really determined by the ability of advertisers to put the right ad in front of the right person in the right format. And I think we're seeing impressive growth in all of those areas. We have more advertisers using the ability to target their ads to the right person. We have more advertisers experimenting with different formats. Stories on Instagram are a very promising one, and we're seeing some nice experimentation there.
And we have more advertisers really embracing the measurement that helps close the loop and helps make their ads more effective. So I think in terms of the ROI we are able to offer our marketers, the signs are strong, and we also continue to see there's a lot of room for improvement.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah, John, on the video investment in the first quarter, it's clearly going to be more weighted towards the rest of the year, but we're already seeing the impact of some of that. So if you look at just the cost of revenue line where that's getting picked up, we saw cost of revenue grow 66% year-over-year. If you look at the gross margin, it dropped from 86% to 84%.
There's really two kind main – two big factors in that compression there. One of those is the video content investment. The other is the move to gross versus net accounting on the Instant Articles product. So those are the two things that I'd point to as being drivers of that margin compression getting picked up in cost of revenue. So video is having an impact, but we grew expenses 39% year-over-year in the first quarter. We're obviously expecting faster growth in the back half – back three quarters of the year, so that's – video's going to be a component in driving that.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much. A couple for Sheryl, if I may. A couple on GDPR. Do you think it's going to have any impact on your measurement capabilities? So that's one. And then secondly, if users elect to take the strictest possible approach to their data management, would their product experience change in any way on Facebook? I mean, we have a sense that their advertising experience might change, but in terms of their use of News Feed or any of your products, would the actual product functionality materially change for them? Thanks very much.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
When you think about the way people have the choice to restrict data use, I think it would affect the product. There is lots of ways we use data to make the product better. It really depends what that would be. I don't think we have full visibility into what those changes would be over the long time.
In terms of measurement capabilities, I don't think there's a direct thing we're exactly worried about right now. It's more what happens over the long time. The way we think about it, and Dave said this, is that the amount of uncertainty there is for us and all the other companies in the digital advertising industry is reasonably higher than it's been right now because we're in the process of rolling out GDPR.
We're going to all know a lot more after we roll out, but the thing that won't change is that advertisers are going to look at the highest ROI opportunity. And what's most important in winning budgets is relative performance in the industry. And so we think that certainly we want to provide the best advertising, we certainly want to provide the best measurement, but our ability to do so as long as things happen across the industry, which is what's happening, I think we remain in a very strong position.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my question. Sorry. Technological challenges. There's been a lot of good questions around core Facebook. Can you talk a little bit about Instagram, Mark, and how do you see the product evolving over the next 12 months? What are your visions for how it could continue to drive more engagement and maybe even higher quality connections on Instagram? And then second one on payments. Could you talk a little about philosophically how you think about the importance of enabling more frictionless payments to drive a higher quality advertising experience on Messenger and WhatsApp?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So, on Instagram, there are a number of really exciting opportunities. The main focus is on helping people capture and share any moment that they want, and also the whole theme that we have around community plays out a little bit differently on Instagram. So for example, while there is no formal groups product on Instagram, people use Explore. More than 200 million people use Explore in order to see content that's interesting to them and interact with people beyond their friends and the people who are – who they follow directly.
We launched hashtag following in December. That's a product that has done very well. I think now more than 100 million people follow different hashtags, which is a way that people can form ad hoc communities, and that – it all goes towards the overall mission that we have as a company of helping to build community and bring people closer together. Private sharing, both with Stories and direct messaging, are growing incredibly quickly on Instagram, and I think that those are both very exciting areas for development of products as well.
You asked about payments in WhatsApp and Messenger, was that right?
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So I think that this is going to be a really big opportunity. And again, like I said earlier, the point here isn't to charge for payments. It's that messaging can be a more transactional medium than feed. So I think what you're going to start to see are people interacting with pages, maybe follow a page on Facebook or Instagram. You see content from that page. You can click through or tap through to a message thread, and then you can either get customer support or complete a transaction or do a follow-on transaction. And that will be very valuable for businesses.
So we view the payment in that context not as the goal, but as something that's helping the business and the person succeed at having the transaction or doing what they're trying to do. And that's going to make people's experience better, somebody can just do that online, and it's going to make businesses – it's going to make the experience of being on Facebook as a business more valuable because you can complete the transactions there.
I'll add one more thing that I think is interesting on payments. I think this is probably different from what you're asking about, but I think it's cool. We've been running an experiment with mobile financial services in Messenger, and one of the things that we found in the Philippines, for example, is that people can buy access to data plans through Messenger.
And because it allows the mobile carriers to not have to have the whole supply chain and sales and retail that they have otherwise, they're able to sell the data plans for on average about 10% less than they would be able to otherwise, which actually is allowing more people to get on the internet in the first place because they can now afford data plans.
So it's an interesting example of how having payments in messaging can increase efficiency for businesses and how in this case that's contributing to our Internet.org and connectivity goals of helping more people access the internet who wouldn't have otherwise been able to. In other cases, it will be able to help people accomplish their goals with different businesses more easily.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks, and good afternoon. First off, related to the machine learning capabilities and more specifically how that's deployed into content filtering, I wonder if you can compare the ability of the machines to analyze content today versus six months or even a year ago? Meaning, is that ability improving at a rate where you have a higher degree of confidence in that reliability?
And then secondly, wonder if you've been able to discern any impact to date on content publishers or apps that are utilizing Facebook for reach and engagement following the rollout of changes in access to APIs, login and other developer resources. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I could take the first one. So on AI, I think that there's a very big shift in how we're going to think about content moderation on the platform.
And I mean, this goes back to the beginning of the service, right? So in 2004, when I was starting in my dorm room, for a number of reasons, it was just me, so we didn't have a lot of capacity to have thousands of people reviewing content. AI technology was not developed at the time.
The only real logical way to run the service was to enable people to share what they wanted and then reactively, if people in the community saw something that was offensive or they thought was against the rules, they'd flag it for us. And we'd look at it and take things down that didn't belong.
Now it is becoming increasingly possible, both because we can build the AI tools, but couple that with being able to hire thousands and thousands of people to do faster review of the content and look at something proactively. We're shifting over the next few years to a much more proactive model of moderation.
Now, one of the things that I think is going to be interesting, and in some cases a little frustrating, is that AI tools lend themselves towards identifying certain content a lot more easily than others.
So one area where I'm very proud that we're doing great work is around identifying terrorist content. And I mentioned this before that 99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda related content that we take down, we're removing before any person flags it to us. And that's great, right? That's doing a good job.
But if you look at areas like hate speech, which are just much more nuanced linguistically, it really depends on the local language, that's an area where I think it's going to take more years to be able to do something reasonably.
So one of the pieces of criticism that I think we get that I think is fair is we're much better able to enforce our nudity policies, for example, than we are hate speech. And the reason for that is it's much easier to build an AI system that can detect a nipple than it is to determine what is linguistically hate speech.
So this is something that I think we will make progress on and will get better on over time. These are not unsolvable problems, although it's worth calling out that our adversaries have all the same AI tools – or some of them, I think. I'd like to think that we're a little bit ahead. But we'll have a lot of the same tools as the field develops.
But the combination of building AI and hiring what is going to be tens of thousands of people to work on these problems, I think will see us make very meaningful progress going forward.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
To your second question, when we think about what's happening with developers, we are doing an audit of large developers and doing some investigation. We don't break out marketer segments, but mobile app install ads, which is where the revenue would come from developers, is a relatively small part of our advertising revenue. And our mobile app install ads help apps of all kinds, not those running on our platform.
So we think the investigatory work we're doing into APIs, into the use, is very important, and we don't expect it to have an impact on revenue.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Two questions, please. David, could you just try to spell out a little bit more how GDPR could actually impact advertising revenue growth in the future, like, what's the doomsday scenario here? Is it just that it's clipped down because there would be a hit maybe near term to MAUs and DAUs? Or is there a reasonable scenario under which tracking or targeting would be impaired? Just spell out what the worst case scenario is. I'm kind of skeptical that there is one. But if there is one, please spell it out.
And then, Mark, on Oculus, could you just give us a little bit of an update on your kind of long-term thinking about Oculus? There hasn't been a lot of focus on it. But Oculus Go is coming out. So maybe we all should take another – have another thought on it, like the opportunity you see there, where you think the product development is at this point? Are we years away from something mass marketable? Any commentary like that would be really helpful. Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
So, Mark, on the first question, I don't know that we really see a doomsday scenario here. I think what we think is that depending on how people react to the controls and the ad settings, there could be some limitations to data usage. We believe that those will be relatively minor. But depending on how broadly the controls are adopted and set, there is a potential to impact targeting for our advertisers.
Obviously, if they are less able to target effectively, they'll get a lower ROI on their advertising campaigns. They'll then bid differently into the auction. That ultimately will flow through into how we can realize price on the impressions that we're selling.
So I think that's the mitigating issue that we could see, depending on how GDPR and our broader commitment to providing these same controls worldwide could play out.
We think that there is a great case for not just our business, but also for the user experience on Facebook to have targeting because we think it's a better experience for the people who use Facebook to have targeted ads. We think we can do that in a privacy-protected way, and it's just a better experience. You get more relevant ads. And I think overall benefits not only the advertisers, but also the people who use Facebook.
So I don't think we see a real doomsday scenario here. We see an opportunity to really make the case.

Your next question...
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
And on virtual reality...
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Mark has a second part of that question.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So on virtual reality here, I think the big picture is that every 10 to 15 years or so there is a major new computing paradigm, right, whether that's DOS and then Windows and kind of desktop UI and then web browsers and now mobile phones and apps. So it strikes me as inevitable that that progression will continue. And each one gets to be more natural to interact with, more natural gestures for controlling, more immersive, more portable.
So I think it strikes me as very likely that the next one is going to be around virtual and augmented reality. So we're investing a lot in this because, frankly, we haven't to date been a hardware company or an operating system company. And we think that we need to build up a lot of different muscles in order to be competitive and be able to succeed in that space and to be able to shape that space.
One of my great regrets in how we've run the company so far is I feel like we didn't get to shape the way that mobile platforms developed as much as would be good because they were developed contemporaneously with Facebook early on, right. I mean, iOS and Android came out around 2007. We were really small company at that point. So that just wasn't a thing that we were working on.
But now I think we're living in a world where – the way that I think about this is that people should really be at the center of how we design technology. It shouldn't be designed around apps. It should be designed around our relationships because that's what matters to people. And that's not the world we're on on mobile. So I really am very committed to this idea of making sure that the next platform reflects those values that Facebook stands for.
I think this is going to be an exciting year. As you mentioned, Oculus Go is coming out. We have the prototype and the developer kit around the higher-end stand-alone coming out as well, and we're doing a number of other things that I think are going to be quite exciting over time as well. But that's how I think about the whole space.
I don't know exactly when it's going to be a big deal. When we started talking about this, I said that I thought that this was going to be a 10-year journey before this was really a very mainstream, major platform. And I think the reality is Facebook needs to be investing before it is a big thing in order to build some of the muscles to be competitive. We're committed to doing that because I think that this is important for our mission.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. When you think about the opportunities for the business broadly, you obviously are crushing it from an advertising standpoint when you look at any measure of growth. But wondering as you think about how you take this massive platform of users and engagement that you have across all your platforms, I'm thinking about if you look at like what Spotify has been able to achieve in music subscriptions, what Apple even has done in music subscriptions, what Netflix is doing in video, Amazon obviously now crossing 100 million subscribers. Like, is there other lines of business, other revenue streams that people should be thinking about that create substantial opportunities, and specifically subscription, and then maybe if you could just touch on from a commerce standpoint now that Instagram's starting to be such a big driver of commerce, how do you think about diversifying revenues versus essentially being almost pure advertising? Thanks so much.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
We've certainly thought about lots of other forms of monetization, including subscriptions, and we'll always continue to consider everything. Ads for us is a very natural fit for our business, and we have a lot of runway ahead of us. We've done – obviously, we have 80 million now pages, so we have 80 million businesses using Facebook on a monthly basis, of which 6 million are advertisers. On Instagram, we have 25 million Instagram business profiles, of which 2 million are advertisers. So even if we just convert people who are advertising on Facebook into Instagram, that's a lot of a growth opportunity. Then you can start thinking about Messenger and some of the other platforms we have.
What's I think interesting and strong about our potential business growth is that we're able to do this across these services. So as I mentioned before, running an ad that has a click to Messenger ad that goes into Messenger is just an early example of what's possible. And I think if you look at a large base of businesses who use us without paying, the growing base of businesses who do pay us and then the runway we have in services that are 1 billion plus (59:48) that we're really not monetizing, I think a strong focus on ads continues to be the best investment we can make. It's also very core to our mission. Ads gives us the ability to provide a free service to the world. And if your goal is to connect to everyone and make sure that people can all participate, that ads-based model makes a lot of sense and we're going to continue to invest very heavily there.

The last question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust.
Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thank you very much. I guess two quick questions for David. Growth in MAUs in rest of world was up about 11%; I think last year, it was up almost double that, 19% or so. Anything changed there that maybe could explain the slowdown? And I think we saw also a slighter – slightly lower growth in pricing as well. And then lastly, on the buyback, how much do you still have left on the old authorization to which we need to add the new $9 billion? And how do you look at it? Is it being (01:00:54) opportunistic, or do you have a timeline by which you guys are planning to complete the repurchase? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, Youssef. On the growth in MAUs in rest of world, we've had certain slowdowns. There was an internet shutdown in Ethiopia that contributed a little bit to that. So you've got some kind of one-time factors that do come into play there. So I think that's probably what I would point to. Nothing that notable to call out there.
In terms of the share repurchase authorization, I would just say that we've just about gotten our way through that. We had about $2 billion left as of the end of the quarter. But we think it's – we asked the board and the board approved a $9 billion additional authorization. We look at it on two fronts: just offsetting the dilution from the share issuances that we have and then secondarily, to be opportunistic. And we think with the cash flow that we're generating, we have a strong financial position with which to fund that.

Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 2017 was a strong year for Facebook in many ways. Our community continues to grow with more than 2.1 billion people now using Facebook every month and 1.4 billion people using it daily. Our business grew 47% year-over-year to $40 billion. I'm proud of the progress that our team has made, and the ways that Facebook is helping people around the world. Giving people a voice who didn't have one before, strengthening relationships by helping family and friends stay connected wherever they are, and enabling more than 70 million small businesses to grow and create jobs.
But 2017 was also a hard year. The world feels anxious and divided and that played out on Facebook. We've seen abuse on our platform, including interference from nation states, the spread of news that is false, sensational and polarizing, and debate about the utility of social media. We have a responsibility to fully understand how our services are used and to do everything we can to amplify the good and prevent the harm. This is my personal challenge for 2018.
One of the most important things we can do is make sure our services aren't just fun to use, but also good for people's well being and for society overall. So far this year, we've already announced a couple of important updates. The first is prioritizing meaningful social interactions over passive consumption of content. Research shows that strengthening our relationships improves our well being. When we use social media to connect with people that correlate to the long-term measures of well being that you'd expect like happiness and health.
But passively watching videos or reading articles may not have those same effects. You can think about it this way. When you see a photo from a friend at News Feed, that's not just content that makes you smile or laugh, it's an opportunity to connect with that friend to reach out to them and to remind them that you care about each other. And that connection is deeply important to us as people. But when you see a video or a news articles, even if it's informative or entertaining, unless you start a conversation around it, you're not building a relationship.
We've also gotten feedback from our community that these moments that lead us to connect to the unique experience that people want and expect from Facebook. But in the last couple of years, the ecosystem of public content like video, news, and post from businesses has grown massive to the point where it's starting to crowd out the personal connection that people value most.
News and video will always be an important part of Facebook. But when people are spending so much time passively consuming public content that it starts taking away from the time people are connecting with each other, that's not good. So let me be clear, helping people connect is more important than maximizing the time they spend on Facebook.
As a result of this update, you will now see more content from friends, family, and groups that lead you to interact with people and less public content that leads to more overall time spent. Now as I made clear announcing these changes, I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down as a result. But I also expect the amount we actually interact with each other to go up over time. We are already starting to see this play out.
On our last earnings call, I said that video done well can bring people together. But too often today, watching video is just a passive experience. To shift that balance, I saw that we were going to focus on videos that encourage meaningful social interaction, and in Q4, we updated our video recommendations to meet other quality changes to reflect these values.
We estimate that these updates decrease time spent on Facebook by roughly 5% in the fourth quarter. To put that another way, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by an estimated 50 million hours every day to make sure that people's time is well spent. That's how serious we are about this.
Now we don't normally share time metrics because they're not the best way of understanding engagement. But this shows how committed we are to making sure that the time you spend on Facebook is valuable. Through this process, we've also got the sense of how some updates impact other metrics as well. For example, changes we made to improve quality in the fourth quarter contributed to a decline in people using Facebook daily in some country.
By focusing on meaningful interactions, I expect the time we all spend on Facebook will be more valuable and I always believe that if we do the right and deliver deeper value, our community in our business will be stronger over the long-term. In this case, it intuitively makes sense. If people interact more that should lead to a stronger community, and we already know that time in News Feed interacting with people is more valuable than time passively consuming video or news.
When you care about something, you're willing to see ads to experience it. But if you just come across a viral video then you're more likely to skip over it if you see an ad. So I want to be clear, the most important driver of our business has never been time spent by itself. It's the quality of the conversations and connection. And that's why I believe this focus on meaningful social interactions is the right one.
The second update we announced is about making sure the information you see on Facebook comes from broadly trusted in high quality sources in order to counter misinformation and polarization. And the idea is this update will show more news from sources that are broadly trusted across the community and not only by those who read them directly.
For example take the Wall Street Journal or The New York Times, even if you don't read them or if you don't agree with everything they write, most people have confidence that they're high quality journalists. On the flipside, there are blogs that have intense following, but are not widely trusted beyond to their core audience. We will show those publications somewhat less.
Preventing false news hate speech and other abused is another important area of focus for us. In order to protect the security and integrity of our platform, we're investing in both people and technology. We now have around 14,000 people working across community ops, online ops, and our security efforts. That's almost double where we were a year-ago.
We've also built new technology to detect suicidal posts that have helped first responders reach more than 100 people who needed help quickly and we've built AI systems to flag suspicious behavior around elections in real time and remove terrorists’ content. Thanks to our AI systems, 99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda related terror content we take down is now removed before anyone even flagged with us. And in some cases before anyone sees it.
We've also made progress demoting false news in News Feed, which typically reduces an article’s traffic by 80% and destroys the economic incentives that most spammers and trolls farmers have to generate these false articles in the first place.
Finally, we’ve started rolling out a major ad transparent effort. We support Congress passing legislation to make all advertising more transparent. We're not going to wait for them to act. We've already begun launching a way for anyone to view the ad, a pages running on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, even if they aren't in the intended audience.
And we're testing this in Canada first with the goal of rolling it out in the U.S. this summer ahead of the mid-term election. As I said last quarter, I expect these investments on top of other investments we're making will significantly impact our profitability. But just like the changes we're making that will impact time spent these investments will help us build a stronger community over the long-term. Now building a stronger community also means delivering on our product roadmap for the next three, five and ten years.
Over the next three years, we know video will continue to grow. So our job is to build a video experiences that help people connect with family, friends and group. That's why I'm excited about Watch as a place to connect with people who have similar interests and why we launch a product like Watch party, where friends can watch a show together.
Another important shift that we're seeing across the industry is the growth of Stories. We expect Stories are on track to overtake posts and feeds as the most common way that people share across all social apps. That's because Stories is a better format for sharing multiple quick video clips throughout your day. The growth of Stories will have an impact on how we build products and think about our business, including Whatsapp and Instagram which are the number one and number two most used Stories product in the world.
Beyond the video, we have a long roadmap working to help people connect in meaningful ways. Today, more people are using groups than ever. These include smaller groups of friends and family and also larger communities where people connect around shared interests. We are focused on helping more people find the right communities for them and giving group admins and leaders the new tools they need to run these groups and help them grow.
The goal of the marketplace is to connect people through commerce. More than 700 million people each month now come to Facebook to buy and sell things. We've launched marketplace in 30 countries last year, including 11 countries in the last quarter alone. Over the next five years, we remained focused on building ecosystems around our services had lots of people already.
In Messenger and WhatsApp, we are working to give businesses more ways to communicate with their customers. We launched a plugin for Messengers that people can chat live with companies on their websites, and now more than 2 billion messages are sent between businesses and customers every month.
WhatsApp recently crossed 1.5 billion monthly active with people now sending more than 60 billion messages every day. A growing number of these messages are between people and companies, which is why we launched WhatsApp business. A new app designed specifically for small and medium businesses to connect with people they want to reach.
Over the next 10 years, we are working on the foundational technologies needed to bring the world closer together. Our goal with AI is to understand the meaning of all the content on Facebook to help us build better services. In addition to making it easier to get people the help they need and remove harmful content, this will also help us show more content that encourages connection and conversation.
And on the VR side, we are excited to get Oculus go into people's hands this year. Time Magazine named it one of the top inventions in 2017 and I can't wait for more people to use it. So 2017 was a good year in many ways, but it was also challenging and that's why our focus this year will be making sure that our services are not just fun, but also good for us. And I'm confident that we will rise to the challenge.
Thanks to all of you for being part of this journey and I am looking forward to making more progress together.
And now, you will here’s Sheryl talk about our business.
Sheryl Sandberg
Thanks Mark, and hi everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter and a great end to the year. Q4 ad revenue grew 48% year-over-year, mobile ad revenue was $11.4 billion, up 57% from last year, and contributed approximately 89% of total ad revenue in Q4. The full-year 2017 mobile ad revenue grew 56% compared to 2016 and was broad-based across regions, marketer segments, and vertical.
We continue to make progress on our three priorities; helping businesses, leverage the power of mobile, developing new ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective. Facebook and Instagram allow people and businesses connect and our especially meaningful platforms for small businesses. Globally 70 million businesses use Facebook. We surveyed small businesses in 18 countries and 57% of them are employing more people due to growth in demand since joining Facebook.
Last week, I met Adam of Kings Barbers Club who started with two employees in Birmingham, England and now has 15 salons and 70 employees. I also met Domingo from Pescaria, a restaurant in Southern Italy that uses Facebook and Instagram to connect with customers. 80% of their diners and 70% of their revenues comes from Facebook. They opened their second restaurant and now employ more than 60 people. Like Adam and Domingo, small business owners are some of the most dedicated entrepreneurs and they are the heart of every economy and create the majority of new jobs throughout the world.
As Mark said, we are taking strong action to maximize the good we do in communities. As part of this we are investing heavily in small businesses and in helping people gain digital skills. In November, we launched our community-based program which provides digital training for people in need of work and helps local businesses and non-profits get the most out of the Internet.
During my trip last week, I announced that we are expanding the program to the EU. This year, we will visit more than 30 cities in the U.S. and Europe to work side by side with SMBs, start-ups and NGOs. Over 2 million people and businesses have already used our online and offline training, and by 2020 will have trained 1 million people and businesses across Europe alone.
As people and businesses shift to mobile, Instagram continues to grow quickly. There are more than 2 million active advertisers on Instagram and we announced in November that more than 25 million businesses have profiles on Instagram up from 15 million in July. Instagram is a business as mobile visual shop and we're seeing more people seek out businesses there. About two-thirds of the visits to Instagram business profiles are from people who don't follow them and this is helping bring in new customers.
Our second priority is developing innovative ad products, each year mobile advertising reaches new milestones during the holiday shopping season. A year-ago, we saw a mobile conversion action taken on a mobile website after viewing an ad on Facebook surpassed desktop conversions for the first time. In 2017 mobile conversions continue to accelerate. Data from 17 markets shows mobile accounted for 69% of online conversions on Black Friday and 64% on Cyber Monday.
It also shows 80% of conversions on Singles' Day, a popular day for online shopping in China and increasingly other countries. Big shopping days like these are the kind of global events that Facebook and Instagram are uniquely positioned to support. During these events and throughout the year, businesses are using our innovative ad products like dynamic ads to connect and reconnect with shoppers.
For example, Holiday Inn Express recently used dynamic ads for travel with our collection formats to advertise to people who search for hotels on their website, but hadn't yet booked. They ran ads with a video that showed a personalized selection of hotels for the city and dates people have looked up. This resulted in three times higher return on ad spend then their previous campaigns.
In Q4 we also launched dynamic ads for auto, which allows dealers and manufacturers to show the right cars to the right audiences. As we expand and improve our ad products advertisers are increasingly developing mobile first ads rather than simply taking their TV creative and putting them online.
Mobile first video was 50% of our video ad revenue this quarter up from 41% last quarter. We're seeing the short form videos work well and Instagram Stories were people can watch a full-screen vertical video and swipe up to quickly learn about a product or brand. 60% of these ads are viewed with sound on.
Recently open table used Instagram Stories to advertise their reservation service to U.S. adults, who are frequent diners or are interested in dining. They combined food and restaurants footage of the book now button. Their ads reached 1.5 million people and achieved 33% lower costs per reservations and their other campaigns. We’re making it easier for any advertiser to try Stories ads as part of their other campaigns on our platform.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Targeting makes advertising better more relevant to people and more effective for businesses. This is especially important for small businesses and they had limited budgets and need to make every dollar counts. Facebook give small businesses the same powerful tools that were previously only available to large advertisers. So they can reach the right people at the right time.
For example, we're continuing to invest in value optimization, which helps advertisers show their ads to people who are likely to spend more with them. We've been gradually rolling this out to advertisers using web conversion dynamic ads and mobile app, install app. Their early results are promising over 2500 businesses have tried value optimization since June and many are putting more of their budgets toward it.
We take our responsibility to prevent abuse of our ad system very seriously. And we're investing heavily in both people in technology to protect the integrity of our platform. In addition to rolling out the ad transparency tool in Canada that Mark mentioned, we've disabled the option that less advertisers exclude people and specific multicultural affinity segments until we can develop better safeguards against discrimination.
We're also focused on improving ad quality and delivering a better experience for people who interact with marketers on our platform. This holiday, we took additional steps to penalize e-commerce advertisers, who created misleading or negative ads. In 2018, we will continue to focus on our same three priorities and do more to ensure the quality transparency and authenticity of ads in our platform.
As part of our effort to be more transparent, last quarter we published our advertising principles, which have long guided our approach across all of our platforms. These principles are commitment to the people who use our services. They are we build for people first. We don't sell your data. You can control the ads you see. Advertising should be transparent. Advertising should be safe and civil. It should not divide or discriminate. Advertising should empower businesses big and small and we're always improving our advertising.
As Mark said, 2017 was a challenging and important year for Facebook, a year where we committed to increasing our investment in the safety and security of our community, it was also a strong year for our business where our investments in helping our clients grow payoff. We will continue to make all of these investments in 2018 and in the coming years. I'm thankful to our partners around the world and to our employees who work so hard to make us better every day. Thanks.
And now here's Dave.
David Wehner
Thanks Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was a strong quarter for Facebook and a great end to the year. Full-year 2017 total revenue grew 47% over $40 billion and we generated over $17 billion of free cash flow. Let's begin with our community metrics. Overall our global community is strong and growing. Daily active users on Facebook in Q4 reached 1.4 billion, up 14% compared to last year, led by growth in markets like India, Indonesia and Brazil. This number represents approximately 66% of our 2.13 billion monthly active users in Q4.
MAUs were up $269 million or 14% compared to last year. As Mark mentioned certain product quality changes impacted our DAU growth. In the U.S. and Canada, these changes contributed to a DAU decline of 700,000 compared to Q3. We don't see this is an ongoing trend, but we do anticipate that DAU in this region may fluctuate given the relatively high penetration level. We continue to see healthy growth across the Facebook family of apps including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.
Turning now to the financials, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $13 billion, up 44% or 47% on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange tailwinds contributed $329 million of revenue in Q4. Q4 total ad revenue was $12.8 billion, up 48% or 44% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue was $11.4 billion, up 57%.
In Q4 the average price per ad increased 43% and the number of ad impressions served increased 4%, driven primarily by feed ads on Facebook and Instagram. Payments and other fees revenues was $139 million, up 7%. Total expenses in Q4 were $5.6 billion up 32%. Headcount remains a primary driver of total expenses. In Q4 we added approximately 1,900 people and ended the year with over 25,000 employees, up 47% compared to last year. In 2017 we made significant investments in R&D and security. On the R&D side, we added more people in 2017 than we did in 2016 and 2015 combined.
On the security side, as Mark mentioned, we have accelerated our efforts and at the end of the year had around 14,000 employees and contractors working across community operations, online operations and integrity efforts. We also continue to invest aggressively in key areas such as content and our long-term innovation efforts.
Q4 stock-based compensation expenses were $814 million, which was down from the $831 million in Q4 of last year, due to a decline in deal related stock-based compensation expenses. As a reminder, we acquired Oculus and WhatsApp in 2014 and we expect the deal related SBC expenses to be substantially recognized by the end of 2018. Q4 operating income was $7.4 billion representing a 57% operating margin.
Our effective tax rate was 43%. In Q4, we recorded net approximately $2.3 billion in one-time charges as a result of the 2017 Tax Cut & Jobs Act. That was largely driven by the mandatory transition tax based on the accumulated earnings from our foreign subsidiaries.
Net income was $4.3 billion or $1.44 per share. Again the one-time charges related to the tax on accumulated earnings reduced EPS by approximately $0.77. Full-year 2017 capital expenditures were approximately $6.7 billion, driven by investments and servers, data center, offices facilities and network infrastructure.
In 2017, we generated over $17 billion of free cash flow and ended the year with nearly $42 billion in cash and investments. In 2017, we brought back approximately $2 billion of our Class A common stock and had approximately $4 billion remaining in our current authorization as of December 31. We remain committed to repurchases of our stock to help manage dilution.
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We believe we have good opportunities to grow the business across both Facebook and Instagram in 2018. We continue to improve the effectiveness of our ads which helps drive ROI for advertisers and demand for our ad products.
On the supply side, we expect we will be able to continue to grow ad impressions at a modest space. In 2018, we expect constant currency ad revenue growth rates to decelerate consistent with the trends that we have seen over the past year. I would also note that in the first half of 2018, we will likely benefit from favorable exchange rate tailwinds due to the recent depreciation of the dollar.
Moving on to expenses. We continue to expect full-year 2018 total expenses will grow approximately 45% to 60% compared to full-year 2017.
Turning now to CapEx. We expect that our full-year 2018 capital expenditures will be in the range of $14 billion to $15 billion driven by increased investment in data centers, servers, office facilities and network infrastructure. We currently anticipate that our full-year 2018 tax rate will be in the mid-teens. In summary, 2017 was another good year for Facebook. We continue to grow our global community and deliver great results for our advertisers.
Importantly, we accelerated our investments to make our products better and the community stronger as we push forward on our mission of giving people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
With that, Mike let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, the quality changes that you mentioned that led to an impact on daily active users in North America. I guess any further detail on what those quality changes were and what makes you feel comfortable this isn't likely to continue? I think you may need to make further changes and cleanup throughout the course of the year?
And then the second one, Mark, I thought your commentary on Stories engagement was really helpful. I'd be curious to hear about early learnings on monetization of the Stories format and any challenges you made to overcome to drive monetization through that consumption? Thanks.
David Wehner
On the quality changes on the impact on DAU in the U.S. and Canada, really no further I think elaboration on that. I would just say that we don't anticipate that that will be a continuing trend, but given the high penetration rates, we do think they'll be some fluctuation there. There's a lot of different effects that come from the different quality changes and focus on meaningful social interactions, but that's our expectation at this point.
Sheryl Sandberg
On story monetization, ads in Stories on Instagram is a small, but quickly growing part of our revenue. There are 300 million daily actives on Instagram alone, and the format is pretty exciting from a sales point of view because it has a lot of potential. Its full screen is authentic, it’s very engaging. So the opportunity in the future for us to combine the power of this new format with the targeting and measurement we offer, we think it’s going to be really powerful for both our business and the business of our clients. It's early days, but I'm pretty optimistic about this.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth
Thanks for taking the question. First, Mark you made it pretty clear that driving meaningful social interactions is the Company's top priority this year, but can you talk a little bit about how the changes you're making impact advertising and maybe you can talk about how you're thinking about any changes around ad load or just overall impression volume? And then how the ads work in an environment of more friends and family content in an environment where you don't see as many business posts?
And then secondly, can you talk about GDPR as well. I don't think you mentioned it, but just curious, I mean you put the blog post out the other day, but if you could talk about how you're preparing here, so that's a rollout over the next few months and whether you think that presents any risk to either engagement or monetization? Thanks.
David Wehner
Hey Doug, it’s Dave. I'll start off on the impact on the business. The biggest focus – the biggest impact of the focus on meaningful interactions as Mark mentioned will be in areas like passive video, where from a business perspective, we monetize less on a time spent basis. So if you think about it in terms of things like post views in News Feed, which drives impression growth that we think this will have less of an impact, and so that's sort of built in to what I had said about the business commentary when I commented on 2018 revenue outlook. We still believe we have an opportunity to grow impressions at a modest space year-over-year across the platform.
Sheryl Sandberg
When I think about the MSI changes, obviously any change that's beneficial for our community is good for the long run health of our business, because as Mark said, we care not just about time spent on Facebook, but time well spent. But even in the shorter-term all time spent on Facebook is not equal, because when people spend time viewing more posts because they're interacting with family and friends and they're not involved in longer post.
We have actually more monetization opportunities. We're not doing this to be positive or negative for revenue. We're doing this because is the right thing for our community. But the impact that has on monetization is certainly not clearly negative. When you think about GDPR, the Facebook family of apps already applies the core principles in GDPR frame, which are transparency and control and we are building on this to make we’re ready to fully comply by May.
We're going to continue to give people are personalized experience to be clear about how are using the data and give choices and we realize that this means that some users might opt out of our ads targeting tool. We also know that there may be a DAU impact for implications on European usage. But from the targeting, we're not forecasting a big impact here. There's some risk and more watching closely. Over the long run, we feel confident that we're very well placed to navigate the transition.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini
Great. Thank you. I had two questions. One, I was just wondering what the advertiser response is then to the lower engagement and also just the kind of I guess cleaning up of the News Feed if you will. What’s kind of there view on this and also can you share with us any metrics on Watch and I know it's really early, but anything that interesting from an engagement perspective here and kind of how do you think this could evolve? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
On the DAU impact any Advertiser response our business is strong. We have over 184 million people using Facebook everyday in the U.S., which is considerably more than the Super Bowl every day on mobile alone. We also have – we think the best stability to target and make advertising relevant for businesses and people who see ads. We're continuing to build the products that allow businesses to get a higher return for the dollars they spend and allow people to see more relevant information in ads on our platform.
So we're pleased with the growth and we believe that that delivering the strong quarter we have shows that. On Watch, it’s just early days. We have a dedicated place for people to watch and comment, where heavily focused on the social aspects of video viewing, but it’s too early to report any really findings.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS Securities LLC
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe following up on the team around engagement and the changes on product. First, how would be defining success? What will you be watching for in terms of either the time spent on the platform or the user growth on the platform or relative engagement to say that you've got the mix right and that people are seeing the right of content and have a healthy experience with Facebook over the next couple of years? That will be number one.
And number two, Dave with respect to the OpEx and CapEx, given the incentive of the company to get a lot of things right on the security side and with repositioning products. Should we expect there to be a different cadence this year in terms of the investments the company might maybe more first half versus second half. Just one note there was any color there? Thank you so much.
Mark Zuckerberg
I can take the first point about meaningful social interaction. So the product directive that I've given to all of our teams is to shift from focusing on showing the most meaningful content to people to instead to now encouraging the most meaningful social interaction. So that will first take hold as the series of News Feed changes, but over time there are going to be new products that we build new interfaces that the team is designed with the goal of encouraging interactions between people.
So the thing that we're going to be measuring is basically the number of interactions that people have on the platform and off because of what they're seeing that they report to us is as meaningful. One interesting thing that I think is worth being clear about in terms of how we develop News Feed. I think that there's this myth that we design News Feed in order to just optimize for time or for likes or comments or some signals like that.
The reality is the way we've done this for years is we've had a panel, a survey of thousands of people who basically we asked what the most meaningful content is that they had seen on the platform or that they've seen off the platform and we design our systems in order to be able to get to that ground truth of what people – real people are telling us is that high quality experience.
So now we're going to shift that that methodology a little bit to instead of just being focused on the content, now to be more focused on trying to measure and have people tell us what is creating the most meaningful interaction in their lives. We're not just on Facebook. It could be a message that you have on Messenger or Whatsapp. But it could also be that you see something on Facebook and have a conversation about that in the world with someone who's meaningful to you and the next to me that we need to understand that.
But that's basically what where we're going to be moving all of these systems towards over the next period of time. And its not just can be one News Feed change that happens overnight. It will be a series of rollouts and then a number of product changes that go to the interface of the products and things that we launch within that as well.
David Wehner
And then Eric, you had a question about, how we might expect expense growth to progress through the year? There is no specific one item that's going to drive it. So we would expect expense growth to ramp throughout the year, largely due to the factors that we've talked about on prior calls in terms of what's driving the overall acceleration. There's the continued investment on the security front. We talked about that in both Mark's comments and my comments and we're continuing to ramp that investment.
We are continuing to invest to support the video strategy on Watch. So we would expect that content investment to continue and ramp. And then finally we're continuing to invest in the long-term initiatives in areas like AR, VR, AI and connectivity. So across the board, we would expect expense growth ramp throughout the year.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Stabler
Thank you. Two if I may, one for Dave and one for Sheryl. First of all for Sheryl, wondering if you could update us on the search opportunity given the rapid growth of product advertising on the platform. Is there an opportunity for Facebook to transition from more of a demand generation platform to demand fulfillment? And then for Dave, can you give us a sense of the timing of the changes to the News Feed? Is this of fully completed rollout were there different cohorts that saw it first? Was there any regional phasing or anything like that? Thank you.
David Wehner
Yes, Peter. I'll take the second part first. We began to make changes around a number of different quality initiatives in the fourth quarter, so that affected metrics that we've talked about including both the time spent and the DAU. But we continue to make changes to improve and to optimize around driving meaningful social interactions as Mark talked about. That's going to be an ongoing journey throughout the year. So there's no – I don't think we ever are going to declare that we are done making changes. So I'd expect we would continue to make changes and evolve.
Sheryl Sandberg
On the search opportunity, there's a growing number of searches on Facebook, but we're still a ways off from monetization. It's worth noting though that because of our ads targeting our ability to reach people multiple times. We do believe that some of our ad success is taking people from demand generation through demand fulfillment.
So we have multiple clients who will show an ad, a video ad to everyone in the U.S. for example or to a big cohort of people and then they'll follow up with an ad that target on either Instagram or Facebook to people who engage with that first that then they can follow up with the next team and we are seeing as businesses are increasingly measuring your ad spend in terms of their real ROI for sales that even within our own platforms. We can move people down that marketing funnel from demand generation to demand fulfillment.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post
Great, thank you. Dave, maybe you can talk a little bit about the sustainability of the pricing growth that you're seeing with advertising. Obviously your outlook for next year suggest decelerates modestly, but it's certainly a very high level and talk a little bit about that. And then maybe Mark or Dave, just talk about how the Watch tab is evolving? Are you seeing a lot of usage there? And how do you think about content in the Watch tab versions the News Feed? Thank you.
David Wehner
Yes. Sure, Justin on pricing growth, I think there we feel like we're making good progress in our goal of driving better outcomes in ROI for our advertisers through things like better targeting, better ad units, driving better conversion, and we think we're making good progress there, and the willingness of advertisers continue to grow budgets with us I think highlights our progress there. You remember they are optimizing at the end of the day for business results for a given dollar spent not the impression price that we're kind of nominally reporting here.
So you can think of all of this work and Sheryl talked about the value optimization efforts as part of that as being an effort to improve the yield of the impressions that we have to drive downstream business results for advertising partners. And if we can drive those affectively that will translate into higher effective prices for our business. And as I mentioned, I think we believe we still have a lot of work to do to continue to improve that. So we think there's opportunities here.
Mark Zuckerberg
And for Watch, it's early, there are some promising signs, but in terms of how we think about this overall compared to News Feed. I would say it's really important to internalize that the News Feed video ecosystem and the Watch video ecosystem are almost completely separate things, right. So the Watch behaviors that we're building is one where people come intentionally to watch specific videos and to interact with the community around that.
That's in contrast to what we worry is too passive consumption of an experience in News Feed today where people just happen to often see a video and maybe they'll watch it for a few minutes, but may not interactive around as much in News Feed. So we're still very optimistic long-term that Watch will be used for video that helps to bring people closer together and that will correlate with all the things that our community is telling us they want and that correlate with the measures of wellbeing that we think that social products can generate by helping people build relationships in terms of all the long-term measures of wellbeing that we care about like long-term happiness and health et cetera.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney
Thanks. Two questions please. European advertising revenue growth or your ad revenue growth in Europe accelerated, is that just currency or anything else you would call out there? And then you talked about progress in moving away from kind of demand or creation towards demand fulfillment or including demand fulfillment. And I was wondering if you could give any more examples of that?
And Sheryl, two years ago or so you mentioned Booking.com being on the platform. I still think those OTAs, based on our work, are still doing like 10x as much spend on Google. So there's a real opportunity versus Facebook. Are there other examples or any other evidence you can show or talk about that that companies are really finding the ability to do demand fulfillment on Facebook and what's caused that to change? Thanks a lot.
David Wehner
Let me just quickly hit on the constant currency question I think you had at the beginning Mark. The acceleration we saw from Q3 to Q4 was currency for Europe, but Europe continues to grow at a very healthy pace on a constant currency basis, so we're very pleased with the results both in constant currency terms and nominal terms. And then Sheryl.
Sheryl Sandberg
So to take the first question, the EU, the strength in Europe was driven by SMBs. We grew across the board with large companies too, but SMBs were really important for this. There are 18 million small businesses on Facebook in Europe, and I had a chance to meet a lot of them on my trip. But to mention just one which shows the point, a couple named Linda and Marius started a company called iELM. They’re a kids clothing retailer. They started in Sweden on Facebook. She was selling clothes in her living room and selling them. Facebook is driving about half their sales. They then opened a factory in Romania and moved back to Romania, where they're now employing 100 people and they're shipping across Sweden, Romania, Germany, and Austria.
There's still a small business at 100 people, but they are a growing business and showing the power of how our work with SMBs is growing jobs. You're asking also for an example of a demand generation going all the way down to demand fulfillment. Here's another one from Europe. Gymshark is a fitness clothing brand based in the UK. They ran Facebook video ads and Instagram Story ads for their Black Friday Campaign and then they target with a look a like people who had previously purchased and custom audiences that people who started, but then complete the purchase. And they saw 9.3 times return of investment over the two week holiday period.
What happens on our platform is often that people will start out during demand generation and then use the repeat opportunity to show people ads, moving down the funnel to demand fulfillment. If you use our targeting tools well, you can actually start out with demand fulfillment. So some of these examples I've shared on this call from holiday end to Gymshark are about people using the targeting tools to find the people who are interested in the products and then you can get closer and down the funnel to demand fulfillment.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Ross Sandler
Hey, guys, just two questions Mark, first on the topic of passive versus active consumption. Can you talk about what percent of the DAUs actively contribute today versus just moving back passive consumption? And how has that ratio maybe changed versus five years or 10 years ago based on some of the product changes that you had in News Feed?
And then Dave just follow-up on pricing, so with the bunch of noise given the growth rates of desktop versus mobile, can you just talk about what pricing growth looks like in mobile like for like geography basis? Is that 20%, 30%, any color there would be helpful? Thank you.
David Wehner
Yes. Ross, I guess I'll take both. Yes, we don't break out the type of metric that you're talking about on the passive versus active consumption. So we don't have anything specifically to share there. In terms of breaking out pricing on a mobile basis. I mean I think overall that the trends reflect a generally what's happening on mobile, but there is still an overlay of a shift from desktop. But overall, we are seeing prices increase on mobile in region, so I think that's consistent with the reported trend.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies LLC.
Brent Thill
Thank you. On Instagram I'm just curious if you give a little more color on the progress you're seeing, any metrics to help fill in what's happening there?
David Wehner
We continue to be pleased with the growth of Instagram both on a user basis and on a revenue basis. It continues to make an increasing contribution to the business. So we're very pleased with the Instagram result, nothing specifically to highlight from a metrics point of view.
Sheryl Sandberg
On the business side, I think we have both pleased with the results. We see a very big opportunity in front of us. We have 6 million advertisers on Facebook, which means we have a lot of opportunity on Instagram, where we only have 2 million advertisers to grow their engagement with us and their spend.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.
Michael Nathanson
Thanks. I have one for Mark on news trustworthiness and then group on sports. So Mark, I realize you're taking great pains not to play the role of the news editor on your platform. You're asking users about trustworthiness, but I wonder does that pick up biases in our own stores of what we believe to be trustworthy and how do you get past that?
And then would it make sense just simply you play the role of pipelining a new News Feed, maybe its own tab with news that we all believe – we believe to be trustworthy. So at some point you take a more active role in identifying the news that your platform believes to be real news and maybe create a new tab that ways. Is that ever something in your thinking?
Mark Zuckerberg
The value that we care about here is helping to build common ground. Right and helping to do our part to fight off news and polarization. So what we're doing. With this specific change which is one of a number of News Feed changes that are geared at improving the quality and trustworthiness of news on Facebook.
What we basically ask people we don't want to assess by ourselves which sources are trustworthy. I think that's not a situation that our position that we're comfortable with ourselves. And I don't think personally that that's something that our community or our society wants us to do. So for all of the feedbacks that we get that we should take more of a view on that, I actually – I don't believe that that is the right thing broadly.
What we try to do is get our community to tell us what matters to them, because we believe that we can get an accurate signal from the community then – people are smart. They know what they want and what's good and they can tell us that, if we can ask them in a simple enough way and get aggregate data.
So what we're doing here is we basically are just asking people, if they're familiar with news sources and whether they trust them. And the effect of that is that it basically normalizes for – there are going to be people who read a given news source, who will probably trust it because they read it.
But the question is that the people who don't read it, who are still familiar with it, do they think it's trustworthy, and that's the example that I gave before the Wall Street Journal or New York Times. A lot of people read those, a lot of people don't, but the people who don't still think that they're high quality journalism in general. And that's not true for a lot of the other stuff that's out there.
And we've found that that's the reliable signal of content that helps to build common ground that is unlikely to be polarizing, that is unlikely to be false news, and what we're doing is helping to show that a little bit more.
Again, we're not going to tell you that you can't share other stuff, right. You can share it on the platform. People can go to your profile. But in News Feed, we're going to just show that a little bit more to do what we view as our role is helping to build common ground, encounter some of these other forces in the world.
Michael Nathanson
Okay.
Sheryl Sandberg
On this sports answer, sports is one of the ways that people get together on Facebook and build community. We're excited to bring the UEFA Champions League Soccer and College Basketball to Facebook, and we're going to continue to experiment with developing many different forms of content for Facebook.
Operator
You next question is from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.
John Blackledge
Great, thanks. Two questions, on marketplace with the expansion to 30 countries, just wondering how the business model evolves over time, does it kind of mirror Amazon’s third-party business or eBay’s marketplace business? And then just on ad units, on the mid-roll video ad units. Just wondering I know it's early, just any color on the ad demand and perhaps how you think about the impact to this ad unit for the next couple of years? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
On marketplace, we're just going to continue to iterate on the ad test. We're pretty encouraged by what we've seen even though it's pretty early days. What we're excited about is that our business is helping people connect with things they want to buy. It's also important to note that commerce is a really important vertical in our ad business. So it's not just the commerce is being driven in ads in marketplace.
But in a much bigger way, commerce discovering product all the way, through to sales is a big part of what's driving our ads business. On Ad Breaks for mid-roll video, early days pretty good result, more than 70% of Ad Break up to 15 seconds in length on Facebook and Audience Network are being viewed to completion. Most are being viewed with the sound on. But again it's very early for this.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI.
Anthony DiClemente
Thanks for taking my questions. Sheryl, just hoping you could help us think about how marketing budgets grow as retail moves online. So investors we speak to ask the question about the addressable market for Facebook. Is the addressable market running out of opportunity as the platform gets larger? So do you believe the overall ad market or the TAM is possibly experiencing structural expansion, due to a shift in e-commerce overall?
And then Mark, I wanted to ask about AI. Can you just talk about the broader applications of the technologies that you are investing into improve the user experience and safety on the platform. So I understand you're using AI to improve the quality of the experience and engagement, but should we be thinking about these investments as also enabling new features and products over time, whether it would be shipping hardware or custom chips or potentially AI as a service externally? Thanks.
David Wehner
Anthony, on the on the marketing budgets, we continue to think we've got great opportunities to grow in the large global advertising market. When you get sort of down to the micro level, you talked about e-commerce. E-commerce is and remains and was one of our strongest verticals in Q4, and we think we're doing an excellent job of building the right products for e-commerce retailers.
And Sheryl talked about value optimization and that sort of work that we're doing, and so I think we've got continued opportunities with e-commerce going forward. So I think we're very well positioned in the e-commerce space. On AI?
Mark Zuckerberg
Yes. I can talk about AI. So machine learning is – the improvement there are by far the largest technological trends that we're seeing in the industry and across the business. And we really see it in three ways, right. The first and most tactical or just the optimization to everything that you see, right, from ranking in News Feeds, your ranking of ads or search, or improving our security systems, and that's driving a lot of the business and the quality improvement that we're seeing and that's really important.
The second category, I would call qualitative changes and how we do business. So for example, for News Feed, historically all the content that's been a News Feed has been content that you're connected to, right. You become friends with someone or you follow a page and then their content can show up a News Feed, but long-term or not even long-term, right.
Over the next several years as we develop an understanding of all of the content on Facebook that won’t be a constraint anymore. At some point, we're going to be able to just understand the meaning of all the content that hosted that you could potentially see and use that as candidates to potentially improve your experience and make it that you could see way more content that you might be able to today to – and of course, we'll do that to help encourage more social interaction.
The way that this is improving the work that we're doing around security and integrity is also very fundamental. Today, that whole model is that people can post what they want and then a person can flag it, and then our systems will look at it. But increasingly as we move into the future, we're going to be able to proactively take down some negative content. I gave the example of the terrorism-related content and some things around suicidal post where if someone posts something that they're thinking about suicide. Now today, we don't have to wait for someone to report it a lot of the time.
In the last few months, there have already been more than 100 instances where we've been able to reach out and get in touch with first responders that they can give you people the help that they need, and that's a big structural change in the way that we do business in terms of protecting the security and integrity of our community. The third major category is going to be completely new products and platforms. So there we talked about all the things that we're building around VR and AR and the ability to be present with anyone, anywhere.
And certainly AI is going to be a big part of that both on the vision side and the voice side. And there are going to need to be big advances there, but that's really exciting. But I think in each of those three categories, the optimization, the upgrading how we do business, and really changing how that works in our products today, and then the new products. I would say that improvements in machine learning are the most important technological trends in the industry now by far.
Sheryl Sandberg
Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Your last question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
Mark May
Thanks a lot. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question regarding Mark's comments that user engagement had declined by I think 50 million minutes in – daily hours in the quarter. I guess the question is how confident are you that that impact was due to News Feed changes that you made proactively versus some other factor outside your control, and if you are still fairly early in the process of making these quality improvements to the News Feed, do you expect for engagement declines to continue going forward?
And just for Dave, I know you choose your words carefully, just want to clarify, you mentioned this year you expect constant currency ad revenue growth to decelerate consistent with trends that we've seen in the last year. I think your constant currency growth rate in 2017 declined by about 12 percentage points. Is that kind of what you're trying to lead us towards? Thanks.
David Wehner
I can take the second question first, Mark. I think what I am trying to say is that we do expect constant currency revenue growth to continue to decelerate consistent with steady deceleration that we've seen over the past year, so we do expect that trend to continue. I'm not putting specific percentages around it.
Mark Zuckerberg
So in Q4, we made a number of quality changes that were largely around video. We are going to continue to make quality changes now going forward around meaningful social interaction. And I do think that that is likely going to continue this trend of decreasing passive consumption, but if we do our jobs well, it should increase the number of meaningful interactions that people have. And we think that that's going to be positive, right. So we think it'll help make the community stronger over the long-term. I mean we think it'll be good for the business over the long-term, but this is what people are telling us is what they want on the product.
It's the unique value that people expect from Facebook. You can go to a lot of places to consume content, but there aren't a lot of services where you can strengthen your relationships, that's what people want, so that's the right thing for us to focus on, and it also lines up with all the well being research that we've done which – and as you know, there have been a lot of debate over the last year about the utility of social media on the Internet, and we take this very seriously, right. It's our responsibility, too, to make sure that we understand everything that's going on on our platform.
And one of the big takeaways from that is that time when people are engaging and building relationships, is good time and that correlates with all the aspect of long-term well being that you'd expect like happiness, and health, and feeling more connected and feeling less alone, and in all of the things that qualitatively matter in our lives. And we think that we can help drive that and improve people's lives by doing that, so we're absolutely going to go do that.

During this call, we may present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
Our community continues to grow, now with nearly 2.1 billion people using Facebook every month and nearly 1.4 billion people using it daily. Instagram also hit a big milestone this quarter, now with 500 million daily actives. And we saw good results in the business, where total revenue grew 47% year over year, and we had our first ever quarter with more than $10 billion in revenue.
But none of that matters if our services are used in a way that doesn't bring people closer together, or if the foundation of our society is undermined by foreign interference. I've expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust. We built these tools to help people connect and to bring us closer together, and they used them to try to undermine our values. What they did is wrong, and we are not going to stand for it.
Now for those who followed Facebook, you know that when we set our minds to something, we're going to do it. It may be harder than we realize up front. It may take longer and we won't be perfect, but we will get it done. We're bringing the same intensity to these security issues that we've brought to any adversary or challenge that we've faced.
The first step is doing everything we can to help the U.S. government get a complete picture of what happened. We've testified in Congress over the past couple of days about the activity we found in last year's election. We're working with Congress on legislation to make advertising more transparent. I think this would be very good if it's done well.
And even without legislation, we're already moving forward on our own to bring advertising on Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency than ads on TV or other media. That's because in traditional media, there's no way to see all the messages an advertiser is showing to different audiences. We're about to start rolling out a tool that lets you see all of the ads a page is running and also an archive of ads political advisers have run in the past.
We're also working with other tech companies to help identify and respond to new threats because, as we've now seen, if there's a national security threat involving the Internet, it will affect many of the major tech companies, and we've announced a number of steps to help keep this kind of interference off our platform. This is part of a much bigger focus on protecting the security and integrity of our platform and the safety of our community. It goes beyond elections, and it means strengthening all of our systems to prevent abuse and harmful content.
We're doing a lot here, with investments both in people and technology. Some of this is focused on finding bad actors and bad behavior. Some of this is focused on removing false news, hate speech, bullying, and other problematic content that we don't want in our community. We already have about 10,000 people working on safety and security, and we're planning to double that to 20,000 in the next year to better enforce our community standards and review ads. In many places, we're doubling or more our engineering efforts focused on security. And we're also building new AI to detect bad content and bad actors, just like we've done with terrorist propaganda.
I am dead serious about this. And the reason I'm talking about this on our earnings call is that I've directed our teams to invest so much in security on top of the other investments we're making that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward, and I wanted our investors to hear that directly from me. I believe this will make our society stronger, and in doing so will be good for all of us over the long term. But I want to be clear about what our priority is. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.
So security and the integrity of our services will be a major focus. Beyond this, our focus is on building community. I talked about this last quarter when we changed our mission to focus on building community to bring the world closer together, and that's more important now than ever. This gets into our roadmap for the next three, five, and ten years.
Over the next three years, the biggest trend in our products will be the growth of video. This goes both for sharing, where we've seen Stories in Instagram and Status in WhatsApp grow very quickly, each with more than 300 million daily actives, and also for consuming video content. We recently launched the Watch tab, where you can discover shows, follow creators, connect with people watching an episode, and join groups with people with similar interests to build community.
But as video grows, it's important to remember that Facebook is about bringing people closer together and enabling meaningful social interaction. It's not primarily about consuming content passively. Research shows that interacting with friends and family on social media tends to be more meaningful and can be good for our well-being, and that's time well spent. But when we just passively consume content, that may be less true.
When done well, video brings us closer together. We've found that communities formed around video like TV shows or sport create a greater sense of belonging than many other kinds of communities. We found that live videos generate 10 times the number of interactions and comments as other videos. But too often right now, watching a video is just a passive consumption experience. Time spent is not a goal by itself. We want the time people spend on Facebook to encourage meaningful social interaction. So we're going to focus our products on all the ways to build community around the videos that people share and watch. That's something Facebook can uniquely do.
Moving along, over the next five years, I expect us to make some good progress on several newer initiatives. In messaging, today already more than 20 million businesses are communicating with customers through Messenger. Now we're starting to test business features that make it easier for people to make the same kinds of connections with businesses through WhatsApp. We rolled out Marketplace to Canada and 17 countries across Europe, giving people the ability to discover, buy, and sell things in their local communities. Today, more than 550 million people are using Marketplace and buy-and-sell groups on Facebook to connect with other people for transactions.
We're also seeing good progress with Workplace, helping companies connect their own teams internally through their own versions of Facebook. It's been less than a year since we launched Workplace, and today more than 30,000 companies are using it. This quarter, we welcomed on Walmart, the largest employer in the U.S.
Over the next 10 years, we are working on the foundational technologies needed to bring the world closer together. I'm proud of the work we're doing with AI. We're now using machine learning in most of our integrity work to keep our community safe. When Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, we used AI to look at satellite imagery and identify where people might live and need connectivity and other resources. Progress in AI can unlock a lot of opportunities. This quarter we opened a new AI research lab in Montreal, and we're building another lab in Paris as well.
This quarter we held Oculus Connect and we announced Oculus Go, our first-ever all-in-one headset that's great for feeling like you're present with someone when you can't physically be together in person. It's great for playing games, watching movies, or hanging out with friends. And at $199, we think it's going to help us bring great virtual reality experiences to more people. It ships next year.
At Connect, I also showed off our new Santa Cruz prototype, which is the first time any company has shown the full experience of positional tracking in a standalone headset and controllers. It's a major technical achievement, and I'm looking forward to getting this into developers' hands next year.
In order to support our community's growth, we need to keep investing in our infrastructure. This quarter we broke ground on our New Albany [Ohio] data center, and we announced that we'll build our 11th major data center in Henrico County, Virginia. As always, all our new data centers are powered by 100% renewable energy. These long-term investments are important for our community's future.
We can do a lot to help people connect through phones and computers, but so much more will be possible in a world where everyone has Internet access, where AI improves all our services, and where we can basically teleport anywhere or be with anyone anytime we want.
With all the issues we've faced, it would be a lot to just invest in addressing those. But we know that we also have a responsibility to deliver these fundamental technical and scientific advances to fulfill the promise of bringing people closer together. So we're going to keep making significant investments looking ahead towards the future too.
We've made some real progress this year. Across the board, we have a lot of work to deliver on our mission of bringing the world closer together, but we're committed to rising to the challenge and doing what we need to for our community.
Thanks to all of you for being a part of this journey, and I'm looking forward to the road ahead. And now here's Sheryl to discuss our business.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone.
We had a strong third quarter, with growth across all regions, Marketer segments, and verticals. Ad revenue grew 49% year over year. Mobile ad revenue was $8.9 billion, a 57% year-over-year increase, making up approximately 88% of total ad revenue.
We're continuing to build our business by focusing on our same three priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing new ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
Today, we're announcing that Facebook has over 6 million active advertisers, and we recently announced that Instagram has over 2 million advertisers. The vast majority of these are small and medium-sized businesses, which are a major source of innovation and create more than half of all new jobs globally. These businesses often have small ad budgets, so the ability to reach people more effectively is really valuable to them.
A great example value is LoveBook, a small business in Michigan which lets you make personalized books for the people you love. During a recent campaign, they used Facebook ads to reach people getting ready to celebrate their first anniversary. They've grown so much from marketing on Facebook that they've been able to hire 10 new employees this year alone. We're proud of the role we are playing in enabling businesses like LoveBook to reach people on mobile, to grow, and to create jobs.
One of our strongest areas this quarter was SMBs in Europe, with revenue growing more than 60% year over year. When I was Germany two months ago, I had a chance to meet Victor, one of the cofounders of Brooklyn Soap Company, which despite its name is based in Hamburg. Victor and his friends came up with the idea for their business while staying in a hostel in Brooklyn. Now they sell their grooming products in 38 countries using mobile video ads on Facebook and Instagram. As a result, their sales increased 62% over the last year. They're one of many small businesses using mobile to find new customers and grow across borders.
Our second priority is developing innovative ad products. Video is exploding, and mobile video advertising is a big opportunity. Until recently, ads were only eligible for Ad Breaks if they also ran in News Feed. But in Q3, we gave advertisers the option to run ads in videos alone. We're seeing good early results, with more than 70% of Ad Breaks up to 15 seconds in length on Facebook and Audience Network viewed to completion, most with the sound on.
As Mark said, Instagram Stories are growing well too. People and businesses are finding creative new ways to use full-screen vertical video in Stories. This quarter, we gave advertisers even more flexibility in the content, format, and reach of their ads in Stories.
We're also seeing how immersive video and images can help people discover new products on Facebook. We added a new creative template to Collection Ads, which helps retailers bring their catalogs online. West Elm, a home décor company, recently used this template to promote its furniture and home accessories. They targeted people who already got their physical catalog and saw a 5.5% lift in purchases in store.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. In Q3, we introduced new tools powered by machine learning and automation to help businesses reach people more likely to spend with them. We also simplified the tools for creating ads, making it easier for businesses of all sizes to advertise with us.
It's important for all businesses to reach the right audience, but it's especially important for small businesses that have limited budgets. Targeting allows them to show ads only to the people they want to reach. Neon Retro Arcade in L.A. is a great example. They advertise to people within 10 miles of their location who are interested in video games and comic books. Last year, they moved their entire ad budget to Facebook and Instagram, and their revenue was up 25%.
Relevance and effectiveness are also about giving businesses more control over where their ads run. In Q3, we clarified which publishers and creators can include ads next to their content. This is good for creators who want guidance on how to earn money from their content on Facebook, and it's good for advertisers who want transparency and control to make the right decisions for their brands. We're also working to give advertisers more clarity on where their ads are shown so they can make more informed choices about where to run them in the future.
I want to close by talking about what we're doing to protect our platform and help ensure that the ads and content people see on Facebook and Instagram are legitimate and authentic. When I was in Washington a few weeks ago, I made it clear that we are determined to do everything we can do to minimize abuse going forward.
As Mark said, we're investing heavily in new technology and people to review ads and posts. This will enable us to look more closely at the content of the ads, targeting, and the advertiser who submits them, as well as tighten our ads policies, particularly for ads directed at social and political issues. We believe that ads are important to free expression and we will continue to accept ads on issues, but we will also do our part to elevate the quality of that discourse.
Transparency helps everyone keep advertisers accountable for their messages. We're working with Congress on new requirements for online political advertising, but we are not waiting for legislation. We're building a tool now that will allow anyone to see the ads of pages running, even if those ads are not targeted to them. We will test it soon in Canada and then in the U.S. in the coming months.
For ads related to U.S. federal elections, we'll start sharing even more information, including an archive of past ads, the total amount spent, and demographics about the people the ad reached. We're also going to require more thorough documentation from these advertisers and will label their ads so it's clear who paid for them. We believe these actions will set a new standard for transparency in online ads.
Because the interference on our platform went beyond ads, we're also increasing transparency around organic content from pages. We're looking at ways to provide more information about who's behind a political or issue-based Facebook page. We believe this will make it harder for deceptive pages to gain large followings and make it easier for us to identify malicious activity.
We are all committed to getting this right and to investing and strengthening our platform so we can better serve our community. We are also committed to continuing to help businesses all over the world attract customers, sell their products, and create jobs. As always, I'm grateful to all of our clients for their partnership and to our global Facebook teams for their hard work.
Thank you, and now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone.
Q3 was another great quarter for Facebook. We saw continued growth in engagement in our community as well as strong performance in our ads business.
Let's begin with our community metrics. Daily active users in Q3 reached 1.37 billion, up 16% compared to last year. This number represents 66% of our 2.07 billion monthly active users in Q3. MAUs were up 284 million year over year or 16%.
Our community growth was again driven by product improvements, promotional data plans, and internet.org. Note that in Q3 we began to lap the introduction of promotional data plans from mobile operators in markets like India.
Before going to the financials, let me touch briefly on our ongoing effort to improve our user aspects. This quarter we implemented a new methodology to help identify duplicate accounts. As a result, we increased our estimates for duplicate accounts to approximately 10% of worldwide MAUs from our previously disclosed estimate of 6%. Duplicate accounts are those that we believe are used by the same person and represent real activity and engagement on Facebook.
We have also increased our estimate for inauthentic accounts to approximately 2% to 3% of worldwide MAUs. Inauthentic accounts are largely those that are used for spam and other policy violating reasons. We continuously monitor and aggressively take down those accounts. These accounts tend to be less active and thus we believe impact DAU less than MAU.
Now turning to the financials, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q3 total revenue was $10.3 billion, up 47% or 45% on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange tailwinds contributed $128 million of revenue in Q3. Q3 total ad revenue was $10.1 billion, up 49%. On a constant currency basis, our ad revenue growth rate was 47%, down 2 percentage points compared to the growth in Q2.
Ad revenue growth was strong globally, led by Europe and APAC with 56% and 54% growth respectively. Mobile ad revenue was $8.9 billion, up 57%. In Q3, the average price per ad increased 35%, and the number of ad impressions served increased 10%, driven primarily by Feed ads on Facebook and Instagram.
I would note that compared to a year ago, price is a much more important driver of our ads revenue growth. Payments and other fees revenue was $186 million, down 5%.
Total expenses were $5.2 billion, up 34%. Q3 was our biggest hiring quarter ever. We added over 2,500 people and ended the quarter with over 23,000 employees, up 47% compared to last year.
Operating income was $5.1 billion, representing a 50% operating margin. Our tax rate in the third quarter was 10%. Excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our effective tax rate by 6 percentage points, a level that was driven by appreciation in our stock price.
Net income was $4.7 billion or $1.59 per share. Year-to-date capital expenditures were approximately $4.5 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, office facilities, and network infrastructure. In Q3, we generated over $4.3 billion in free cash flow, and ended the quarter with over $38 billion in cash and investments.
Year to date, we have bought back over $1 billion of our Class A common stock.
Turning now to the revenue outlook, our ads business remains strong, but it's worth noting that in Q3, our year-over-year ads revenue growth rates decelerated for the fifth consecutive quarter on a constant currency basis, and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Going forward, we also expect the growth in advertising revenue will increasingly be driven by price. This is a shift from prior years, when growth was primarily driven by increases in supply.
Turning now to expenses, we anticipate that our full-year 2017 total expenses will grow approximately 35% to 40% versus our prior range of 40% to 45%. We anticipate that full-year 2017 capital expenditures will be approximately $7 billion. As mentioned previously, our tax rate will vary based on our stock price. At the current stock price, we would expect that the Q4 rate will be in the low teens.
I also wanted to provide some comments on 2018 expenses and capital expenditures. Please recognize that these are preliminary estimates, as we have not yet finalized our 2018 budget. That said, it is shaping up to a be a significant investment year, and I wanted to provide initial guidance to align investors with our most current thinking.
We expect full-year 2018 total expenses will grow approximately 45% to 60% compared to full-year 2017. We continued to invest aggressively across the business, but there are three important factors driving an acceleration in our expense growth rates from 2017 levels.
First, as Mark outlined in his earlier comments, we are making sizable security investments in people and technology to strengthen our systems and prevent abuse. Secondly, we are investing aggressively in video content to support the Watch tab. Finally, we continue to invest in our long-term initiatives around augmented and virtual reality, AI, and connectivity. Given our expectation of continued deceleration in revenue growth rates, we expect these significant investments will be net negative on our operating margins.
In addition, we expect to make substantial investments in our infrastructure to support growth and improve our products. As such, we expect full-year 2018 capital expenditures will roughly double from 2017 levels.
We would also anticipate that the full-year 2018 tax rate will be in the mid-teens.
In summary, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook across the board. We are excited about the opportunities we see ahead and will continue to make significant investments to support our growth and our mission.
With that, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan, UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe revisiting Mark's comments at the beginning of the call, I would love to get a better sense or granularity about what sort of video content you'd like to see on the platform that could drive a more active or interactive experience than passive.
And then the second question would be, what does that mean in terms of the business model? Would there be licensing content, funding content that you have to do to build the sort of business you're aiming for over the medium to long term? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So the strategy here around helping people connect reflects more on what we do around the videos than some of the content itself. So hopefully, the experience on Facebook will not just be that you come and watch a video and you get informed, you feel entertained, and that's it. We think that the most valuable thing that people do are help build relationships with other people on the platform. So to the extent that video can serve as a touchstone for building community and helping facilitate interaction, then that's the thing that we feel like we can uniquely do.
So we're going to continue investing heavily in video content for Watch that is centered around people, that is centered around the things that people want to talk and connect around, that give people a sense of pride and bring people together. But we're going to invest as much in just making sure that we build out the community features around that. And that I think is going to be the thing that differentiates this over time.
Operator
Your next question comes from Brian Nowak, Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just, Mark, to go back on your focus on community and video, I was wondering if you could share with us or help us understand what you're seeing in engagement trends or maybe time spent per user on the core Facebook platform, as you've had so many efforts focused on community and video.
And then secondly for Sheryl, you made such good progress growing the advertising business across SMB in a lot of verticals. I wonder. If you step back, could you talk to any areas or any verticals where you really see the potential for material improvements or verticals you're having a hard time cracking into that you think can really be bigger drivers of ad revenue growth going forward?
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
So, Brian, just on engagement metrics, we're continuing to see good growth in DAU, as you saw in the 16% growth that we posted this quarter. In addition, we do continue to see time spent growth per DAU on the Facebook family and on Facebook.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
For my part, when I think about our Marketer segment, we have SMBs; we have brand, direct response, and developers. We're seeing strong growth across. I think if you think about where the growth remains, it really is in increasing the relevance of the ads, because the ads I think are getting better in terms of reaching the right people at the right time. But I think there's still a lot more we can do. And as people really use our Custom Audiences, our targeting tools, the quality of the ads improve and the returns improve. And the more we – the better we get at measuring those returns, the better the ads get.
And so I'll share just one example but one I really love, which is the Alameda County Fair, which is a local fairground in Pleasanton, California. I happened to meet this woman, Angel [Moore], who's running their marketing this year. And they use Facebook to target people within 25 miles of their fairgrounds age 20 to 51 who have specific interests in concerts, music festivals, and theme parks. And what they saw for season pass ticket sales for 2017 was a 50% increase compared to 2016, and they attribute that to Facebook. And that's really about finding the people that are interested.
And if you look at the percentage of our ads business where people are using our most sophisticated approaches to finding the right audience, I think we still have a lot of opportunity for growth there, and that will improve both the quality of the ads people see but also the returns to marketers. And I think that will hit all of the verticals and all of the segments.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark May, Citi.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you. I had two related questions on video. First on the OpEx guidance, one of the real consistencies of the business is OpEx growth. You've been growing that at $4 billion to $5 billion incremental spend per year, but the midpoint of your guidance is looking like a $14 billion increase next year. Is the differential there, the additional $6 billion to $7 billion, should we be thinking of that as the video content spend that you're setting aside possibly to spend next year? I'm just trying to understand where this significant increase would be coming from.
And then related, the 35% increase in ad prices – would you say that that's predominantly being driven, the acceleration there, by the mix towards video, Ad Breaks, and other longer-form video ads? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, Mark. So on the acceleration of the growth rate in expenses from 2017 to 2018, I would really look at the growth rate that we grew at in 2017, apply that to the total expense base, and look at that growth in 2018. And then I would say the additional expense that leads to the acceleration is driven by three factors, not just one factor.
And those three factors are the ones that I outlined in my commentary: number one, the substantial investment that Mark highlighted that we're making to just improve the security on our platform; two, the video content investments we're making for Watch tab; and then three, additional investments we're making in the long term initiatives like AR/VR, AI, and connectivity. And each of those are significant, so it's really the combination of those three factors that's driving the expense growth acceleration.
And then on the 35% increases in ad prices, this is really being driven off of a couple things. One is just the auction dynamic, which as supply growth has slowed, then there's more competition, and you're seeing prices increase as demand continues to grow.
But I think what is important here is we've been getting better and better at targeting as we optimize for real business results for advertisers, and we're better at converting the signals that we get from those advertisers into finding the right ad spots for them. And I think that's really what's allowing us to improve yield and effectively driving higher effective CPMs for us while still delivering business outcomes to them at attractive ROIs.
So that's really what's driving it, not a shift to a different format like video. It's really about us getting better at targeting and working with especially people where we get those downstream signals like direct response advertisers.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to hit on two topics. First just on the security comments, you talked about head count increasing from 10,000 to 20,000. I was hoping you could just help us understand. Is that 10,000 fully in the 23,000 head count that you have today, or is there a part of it that's not included in there, perhaps because it's not full time?
And then just secondly, just going back to the ad pricing changes, Dave, just to clarify on that, it sounds like what you're saying is it's not that advertisers across the board are seeing that substantial of an increase in pricing, but that's more in output in your eCPM. Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Right, Doug. So on the first one, the 10,000 number, that encompasses both employees at Facebook and also employees at partners, so it's not all Facebook employees. So that's a fully loaded number. So that's also in the OpEx guidance as well. But yes, you can't compare the 10,000 to the 23,000 directly.
On the ad pricing, what you're seeing is that most of the advertising that we get isn't necessarily bid on an impression basis. You're getting people bidding for other actions and optimizing against other actions like a click to a website or a downstream e-commerce transaction, an app install. And our ability to optimize the inventory that we have against those downstream activities allows us to deliver those at still good prices while still seeing effective CPMs go up.
You do have obviously people who are bidding on impressions if they're looking for a brand campaign or a reach campaign, but those aren't necessarily a part of the business that's driving up prices. It's more around just us doing a better job at being able to optimize campaigns for people who have downstream activities that we can do that for.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great, thank you. I wanted to just ask a question about your content strategy, and I was wondering. How do you think about Facebook Watch in terms of Facebook-produced content versus the licensing of content that you might engage in? And I was wondering if there's a certain type of content that you think will be best suited to optimize the Watch experience. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I think it might be useful to talk a step back and first talk about why we're funding lighthouse content and Watch overall. So video is growing incredibly quickly on Facebook. And today, most of that is in News Feed. But most people who come to News Feed and who come to Facebook today in general are trying figure out – they're trying to see what's going on with their friends, see what's happening in the world. They're not coming necessarily to engage in a specific type of video or specific community around video. So the Watch tab is mainly – it's a way to give people a tool to do that. When they want to specifically come and engage around video or communities around that, they can go to the Watch tab. So the intent there is different.
Now in order to build that up, we think it makes sense to first invest in a bunch of lighthouse content, some that we may produce or some that we may license, to get to your question. We're pretty agnostic on how that goes. We just want to start the flywheel going, so that way there's content and communities that are there that support this use case of people coming to Facebook specifically to engage in that.
Long term, our hope is that the business here will primarily be through revenue shares of videos that normal creators and businesses put into the system rather than ones that we proactively go out and license ourselves. So that's a look at where we're trying to get on this. But first, we need to build this behavior where people want to come intentionally to engage with this content.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Sena. Wells Fargo Securities.
Ken Sena - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, thank you. Just going back maybe to the investment and security comments, maybe could you provide a little more detail just on what that investment could look like and how we could think about that showing up in R&D, cost of revs, G&A, or maybe a combination, and then maybe any early thoughts on GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] and potential impact there and maybe some of these transparency efforts if they could have possible benefit? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
So on the first part, Ken, you're going to see that show up in a variety of different line items that we don't have it specifically broken out. We're making substantial product and engineering investments. So as part of the overall hiring on R&D head count, there's going be a pretty significant allocation of that to some of the product-related security initiatives that we're doing. So that's going to show up in R&D.
You're going to have some of the ads work that we're doing, the ads quality work showing up in the sales and marketing line, so you're going to see some there. And then you're going to also just have overall impact on G&A as well for things like policy-related expenses and the like. So I think you're going to see it impacting across the spectrum of our lines, but overall one of the significant factors driving the acceleration in growth rate.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On GDPR, the Facebook family of apps already applies the core principles in the framework because we built our services around transparency and control, and we're building on this to ensure that we comply in May of next year. It's too soon to tell whether this will impact the extent to which EU users opt out of certain services, but we're going to continue to give people personalized experience and be clear about how we're using the data. We believe that we'll be able to obtain consent for uses of the data across Europe and that people still expect the content and their ads to be relevant. And so we expect a good result here and we're going to do it very carefully and very seriously, as we always do.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great, two things. First, as you've integrated more video content into Facebook, are you seeing better time spent per user? Is that really showing up in more engagement on the site?
And then secondly, it looks like you're running around $80 a year per user now in the U.S., quite, quite good improvement over the last couple years. Just thinking about benchmarking that versus other media categories or other things in traditional media, do you still think you have a lot of room ahead to grow that $80 over time? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I'll talk about video engagement, and then Dave can jump in on some of the stats. So one of the important points here that I tried to communicate in my comments up front is that connecting with friends and family and having those meaningful interactions is more important than just consuming content. So video is growing incredibly quickly, and that goes across both social content and more passive public consumption of content. And they create different dynamics in the system, and I think that's an important thing to understand.
When your friend posts something and you get to engage with it, it might inform you and entertain you. But you also, if you interact with it, you're building a relationship with that person or you feel closer to that person, and that is a really important part of what social networking is supposed to do. Whereas when you engage with public content, you might get informed or be entertained, but it's not necessarily increasing social capital in the same way or building relationships between people.
So we really differentiate what the core thing is that we're trying to do, which is help people connect with each other and build meaningful relationships. And that's why on a lot of these calls, I emphasize products like Instagram Stories or WhatsApp Status, which are very video-based products, but they're improving social interactions. And we're going to focus a lot more on helping people share videos of their moments in their lives. Because in a lot of ways, I think if you take a video of yourself and your family out trick-or-treating, that's more engaging than a photo and a better representation of that than writing it out in text.
But overall, I would say not all time spent is created equal. That's why I tried to stress up front that time spent is not a goal by itself here. What we really want to go for is time well spent. And what the research that we found shows is that when you're actually engaging with people and having meaningful connections, that's time well spent, and that's the thing that we want to focus on.
So out of this big video thing that's growing very quickly, I think that is the real opportunity and product area that we should be focused on more. And to the extent that there is going be a lot of public content, which there will be, a big part of the focus is going to be around building community and interactions around that content.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Justin, then your question on ARPU in the U.S., we do think that there are opportunities to continue to grow the business in the U.S. on a lot of different fronts. So we can continue to grow engagement on core Facebook, as well as there are opportunities with Instagram and the other services that we have that are not monetizing significantly today, so there are opportunities there.
But most importantly, I would go back to the fact that we're getting better on the ad product side of being able to optimize our inventory for the advertisers in a way that will we think drive good pricing in the system for us and good outcomes for the advertisers. So we do think that that will lead to the potential for additional revenue growth in the U.S.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler, Barclays.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great, I had two questions for Mark. One, so, Mark, as you look to make changes around safety and security and ring-fence the fake news issue, do you think that will have any adverse impact on engagement, or is it just too small to even be material?
And then a follow-up on the video consumption comment happening mostly in the Feed, is the deceleration you guys are seeing around impression growth right now a function of promoting video in the Feed versus what other things that might be in there? And I guess asked a different way, should we see impression growth revert back to view (43:52) growth at some point? And is that likely next year, or is that further off into the future? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
So I can take the second one, which is the question about impression growth. So there are a couple factors there. Certainly, this quarter we saw that ad load had a much less significant impact on impression growth. So overall, that story has played out as we thought, and that's one of the reasons you're seeing the impression growth come down. And then yes, I do think that there are less impressions when people are consuming video, so that also is a factor as more time is spent on videos. So I think you have both of those factors coming into play.
In terms of how those play out going forward, hard to say. I would just point to our overall comments on just continued revenue growth deceleration. And I believe the first question was whether the security investments would have an adverse impact on engagement.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yes, and I can speak to that. Let me be clear on this, that people do not want false news or hate speech or bullying or any of the bad content that we're talking about. So to the extent that we can eradicate that from the platform, that will create a better product, which will also create a stronger long-term community and better business as well.
So the reason why we haven't been able to get these things to the level that we want today is not because we somehow want them on the platform. It's that it's a really hard problem. And we're going to invest both in people and technology because we think that both are really important parts of the solution here, to go after all different parts of these problems.
And that was what I tried to stress earlier on. We're going from 10,000 people working on safety and security to more than doubling that to 20,000. We're building – we're doubling – in some cases more – our engineering teams focused on security. We're building AI to go after more different areas of harmful content and finding fake accounts and other bad actors in the system. And I expect that all of these things will make our product better over the long term, but we will incur the expenses a lot sooner as we ramp up these efforts.
And I also just think that going forward, we're going to be investing in these things at a much higher level because we realize that this is important, not only for our community and this company, but it's part of our responsibility to society overall.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield, BTIG.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question, a couple things. You talk about creators, I think, Mark, creating for the platform on their own without you having to invest. But I'm just trying to frame it in the sense of Hollywood. I look at what Apple is doing now and hiring a couple of Sony executives and doing a $5 million an episode buy of a Steven Spielberg show.
I'm guess what I'm trying to understand – or I think a lot of investors are trying to understand is what type of content do you ultimately want? Because I don't think someone like Spielberg is going to work for an ad revenue share, no matter how good that advertising is. So how do you balance what type of content business you ultimately want to build?
And then when you look at sports, which I also think about as being really relevant content that has a huge community around it, something like the NFL mobile rights I think come up next year. I'm wondering how important is that type of content? I know you were bidding on cricket rights overseas, but how important is sports in this mix?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Well, I think the answer to that is we don't know all the answers around what kinds of content are going to work and are not, so we will probably experiment with a number of different things.
I do think your point is right that not all kinds of content can be supported by ads, no matter how effective we make that. That said, the current model that we have for at least getting some of the lighthouse content onto the platform is to pay up front. And what we would like to transition that more to over time and what an increasing amount of the content is, is revenue shares for ads shown in the videos. And as we do better and better on the monetization there, that will support people with higher production costs and doing more premium production and bringing their content to the platform.
And we've certainly found on the Internet and YouTube and in other places that there are whole industries around creators with different cost structures than traditional Hollywood folks who can produce very informative and engaging content that a lot of people like and enjoy and that builds communities and that helps people connect together in a way that definitely can be supported by this ad model.
So I think the answer is we're going to try a bunch of things. That's a bunch of what the budget is. I'm very optimistic that a lot of this stuff will be able to be supported long term, but you're certainly right that not all of it will be able to be supported by ad models alone.

Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies.
Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. On video, there's been a lot of questions about the ultimate profitability of this going forward. I was just curious if you could share your view. I know it's early, but what your thoughts are there.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
I think – look, today we're talking about the additional investments we're making in terms of the lighthouse content on the Watch tab, so we are putting a substantial investment behind that. That clearly is going to have implications for margins along with the other big investments that we're making next year. And then even after we establish a flywheel here and get content being produced for ad revenue share, that's going have a different margin structure than core News Feed. So even going forward, there's going be revenue share back to the content creator, so it's going have a different margin structure than the core business.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
I think it's worth adding that the ad inventory itself is really valuable for marketers and our clients and also works very well with our other ad products, so I'll share a recent one. Visa with SocialCode and BBDO created 10-second videos with text overlays showing people making digital payments. And they targeted millennials and early tech adopters. And they ran ads – one group for Facebook News Feed only, one group for Ad Breaks only, and one group for News Feed and Ad Breaks combined. And the best results combined the Ad Breaks and the News Feed. They had a seven times lower cost per video view compared to News Feed alone.
And so one of the opportunities we have here is increasing inventory, and it's particularly good inventory for marketers because we're seeing nice adoption of video views and really nice impact from those sales. And it's also the case that our ad products work together. The ability to show something in News Feed and then show a video in Watch and then show something on Instagram and measure results across the full funnel we think are very worthy investments for the long-term health of the business.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney, your line is open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Sorry about that, a comment and two questions. I think this incremental spend or this materially increased spend on security is highly unfortunate, but I think it makes eminent sense. I think most long-term investors realize that community maximization, including security, would lead to long-term profit maximization. So I think it makes eminent sense.
Two quick questions, the Watch tab, is there any evidence or any data points you can give us to what kind of traction you're seeing with that so far? I was surprised by how many people are on the Marketplace. Any relevant data like that for Watch tab?
And then secondly, of all the regions, Europe really stuck out to us as one that showed surprising acceleration. And I know you talked a little bit about that, Sheryl did, about the SMB pickup in traction there. Any other color for why Europe would have accelerated so much in terms of its revenue growth? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, let me I guess hit both of those and then Sheryl can add any color she'd like. On the Watch tab, I think it's just early. So I think it's too early to be talking about any stats there.
In terms of Europe, one thing to note is that we did pick up currency advantages there. So it was 56% on a reported basis but 51% on a constant currency basis, still a healthy growth rate. I think it's a strong economy there. I think the team is executing well there, so I think you've got a variety of factors. As then as Sheryl commented in her prepared remarks, SMB has been particularly strong in Europe. And so I think that's one of the key drivers and one of the things we're really happy with.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
One clarification on your question two is that the 550 million people is across both Marketplace and buy-and-sell groups, not just the Marketplace tab. So that's the total amount of activity that we're seeing there across both of those things.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian, Baird.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks for taking my question, first, a quick follow-up on safety and security. I guess I'm wondering why more of the AI and machine learning that you've built for product and the ad platform can't be utilized or cross-utilized to help mitigate some of the costs of adding people and technology to handle those issues.
And then secondly, related to how much time younger people are spending or not spending on the Facebook apps, I wonder if you've looked at over the course of time the trend in usage as younger people hit different milestones in life such as graduating from college or getting a job and how their usage of the app changes over that timeframe, for example, if you're seeing a steady stream of the users come to Facebook once they hit those milestones. Any color on that would be interesting. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, I'll speak to the safety and security investment, and then Dave can speak to the other question. So we need both technology and people for this. And the best articulation of this that I can make is that today, AI has different strengths than people do. So the AI tools that we've built can enable a system to look at millions of pieces of content and make rough assessments on them and figure out what to flag for people. But ultimately, if you want to get those high-quality judgments today on sensitive content and you want to do it quickly when the stakes are pretty high in terms of taking down content or leaving things up, and we take that extremely seriously, you want people to be looking at that.
So earlier in the year, when we were working on problems like seeing issues when people were going live, there was this really serious issue around people with self-harm and in some cases suicide on Live, and we made an investment in AI tools and in dramatically increasing the staffing of the team that was working on that and brought the amount of time to review those Live videos down through a combination of those things to – I think it's under 10 minutes now. That might still be a conservative estimate, and we're continuing to work on that.
So now what we're trying to do is just increase the SLAs that we have across all of these different types of content and security threats that we might see. So that way, through a combination of the AI tooling that we build and having people to look at these things, we can get it right faster for more of the types of content.
And you're definitely right that a lot of the AI research that we do is applicable to multiple areas, but we still need to build those tools. So it takes a lot of engineering investment, and we will be prioritizing that, in some cases by adding people to teams and in other cases by trading off and doing more security work instead of other product work that we might have done, but this is really important and this is our priority.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
I think on how people use our products in life stages, I would just – I would say generally, what we're trying to do is build a variety of different types of social products that can help in a variety of different use cases, so it can be one-on-one messaging with WhatsApp and Messenger. It could be sharing to Groups with Facebook. It could be the friends that you have on Instagram. So we're trying to make sure that we flesh out the full range of sharing experiences, and we think that has applicability across all the different life stages. And depending on the ages, people use the products differently, but not sharing any specific breakouts on that.

Your last question comes from the line of Youssef Squali, SunTrust.
Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Thank you very much, just one question. You guys unbundled the video buy. Can you speak to pricing relative to that 35% average increase in ad pricing? Can you maybe just help us understand the disparity that exists today between pricing on the new video platform and the legacy video platform? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
So I'm not totally clear on what you mean by the new video platform and the legacy video platform, but I would just say that this is primarily driven by News Feed pricing, and then you have right-hand-column pricing as well, so you have impressions on Facebook News Feed, Instagram feed, as well as Facebook right-hand column. Ad Breaks are really a relatively small – a very small factor today. So the pricing is really about what is the pricing that you're seeing in the overall system primarily driven on the Feed-based products. So that's really what the driver is. And, again there, I would point to the comments that I made about getting better at targeting and driving towards good outcomes for advertisers as being the reason that we've been able to support higher prices.

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today.
This quarter we reached an important milestone for our community. 2 billion people now use Facebook every month, and more than 1.3 billion people use it daily. We also saw good results on the business, with total revenue growing by 45% year over year to $9.3 billion, and advertising revenue up 47% to $9.2 billion.
We're proud of the progress we're making, and it also comes with a responsibility to make sure that we have the most positive impact on the world that we can. That's why last month we updated Facebook's mission. For the past decade, we focused on making the world more open and connected. We have a lot more to do here to give people a voice and help everyone stay connected with their family and friends, but now I believe we have a responsibility to do even more. Our new mission is to bring the world closer together.
A big part of this mission is building communities. Communities give us the sense that we're part of something bigger than ourselves, that we're not alone, and that we have something better ahead to work towards. Last month, we had our first-ever Facebook Community Summit to talk about our product roadmap, focused on building what we call meaningful communities. Meaningful communities on Facebook are groups that quickly become an important part of your social network experience and your real world support structure. And right now, over 100 million people are members of these groups, from new parents to people suffering from rare diseases. These groups often span online and offline and bring people together physically as well as over the Internet.
Our goal is to help more than 1 billion people join meaningful communities. And part of this involves helping people discover the right groups, which is why we're building technology like AI to better understand people's interests and suggest groups that might be meaningful to them. And in the six months after we started working on this, we've already helped more than 50% more people join meaningful communities than had before them, so we have a lot more to do here.
We also want to make it easier for people to build and lead communities. Last month, we launched new tools for group admins, making it easier for them to get Insights into who their members are, filter member requests, and remove bad actors and their content quickly to keep a positive and safe environment.
Next, I want to give a quick update on what we're building over our three time horizons: making our existing services more useful now; building new ecosystems over the next five years around our products that a lot of people already use; and creating foundational technologies to achieve our mission over the next ten years.
So we're pleased with the growth that we're seeing with Stories. Instagram Stories now has more than 250 million people using it daily, and WhatsApp Stories also now has more than 250 million people using it daily. We're always working to improve and give people more ways to share. And this quarter we added the ability to reply to Stories with a photo or video and share a replay of live video on Instagram.
I am excited about how AI will improve people's experiences across our products. We're finding AI is both delivering consistent improvements to many of our systems, like News Feed, search, ads, security, and spam filtering and more. But more than just improving these existing experiences, I expect AI to change the way that we do business in some important ways. So for example, today to keep our community safe, we rely on people flagging content that might violate our community standards for us to review. In the future, AI will be able to help flag more of this content faster before people have even seen it.
Now we've started using AI to fight terrorism and keep propaganda and extremist accounts off Facebook. We've even started experimenting with using AI to understand texts that might be used to promote terrorism.
When it comes to News Feed, we currently mostly show you content from people and pages you're connected to. And we can write this better with algorithm improvements, but the really big improvement from AI will be when we can understand all the other content that's out there so we can help you discover much more of what matters to you beyond just what your friends are up to.
On the business side, we're seeing a large shift in the way that marketing works. In the first wave of marketing, people would buy ads and media they thought their customers might watch like a TV show that had similar demographics, but they wouldn't know who saw their ads. The Internet gave people the power to target their messages to people who actually might be interested and to measure results much more precisely, and that was a big improvement. And now AI is taking this a step further. Now you can put a creative message out there, and AI can help you figure out who will be most interested. A lot of the time you don't even need to target now because AI can do it more precisely and better than we can manually. This makes the ads that you see more relevant for you and more efficient for businesses. Those are just a few of the reasons why I'm optimistic about how AI is going to improve our core services over the next few years.
Over the next five years, we're going to build ecosystems around products that a lot of people are already using. We've talked about how video will continue to be a big focus and area of investment for us. It's growing quickly, and we're introducing new features to make the video experience even better. For example, in May we made the option to go live with someone else available to all profiles and pages on iOS. And we also launched closed caption to make Live more accessible.
We're also working to build a business ecosystem around Messenger and WhatsApp. Messenger and WhatsApp both have large communities, and they're growing quickly, with 1 billion people now using WhatsApp daily. It is still early on the monetization side here, although we have started showing ads to a small number of people on Messenger. I want to see us move a little faster here, but I'm confident that we're going to get this right over the long term.
Now finally, over the next 10 years, we're working on foundational technologies that are necessary to achieve our mission. In VR, we launched Live from Spaces, so you can go live with friends in different places. And we think that this has the potential to be a powerful tool to bring people together and help build community in some new ways.
We're also working to help everyone in the world access the opportunities that come with the Internet. In May, we successfully flew Aquila, the solar powered plane that we're building to beam Internet to parts of the world that currently don't have access, and that was the second successful flight. These initiatives and other projects require a lot of ongoing aggressive investment in the infrastructure to serve our communities. Last quarter, our Fort Worth data center went live and is now serving traffic using 100% renewable energy, and we're also expanding our data centers in Los Lunas, New Mexico and Altoona, Iowa.
This first half of 2017 has been an important period for Facebook. We've achieved some major milestones, delivered good business results, and set clear goals around building strong communities and bringing people and the world closer together, but we have a long way to go. So thanks to our community, our teams, and our partners for all being a part of this mission. I'm looking forward to making more progress together.
And now here's Sheryl.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone.
We had a strong second quarter and a great first half of the year. Our business continues to deliver terrific results. Q2 ad revenue grew 47% year over year. Mobile ad revenue grew 53% year over year to $8 billion and is now 87% of total ad revenue. Our growth continues to be broad-based across regions, marketer segments, and verticals.
Our goal is to build meaningful connections between people and businesses by focusing on our three key priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing innovative ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
Our first priority is helping businesses leverage the power of mobile. People are rapidly increasing the time they spend on mobile, and businesses know they need to be where consumers are. Given the size and engagement of our audiences, Facebook and Instagram are the best platforms to reach people and drive business results. We have over 70 million businesses on Facebook, and I'm excited to announce today that we now have more than 15 million business profiles on Instagram.
Video is an important part of our mobile strategy. More video is being shared and watched on Facebook than ever before, and it's increasingly helping people and businesses connect. That's because video on Facebook is personal, so it's around connections, conversations, and communities. This is why it creates opportunities for businesses to reach people in new and creative ways. People consume content faster on their phones, and marketers are increasingly recognizing that this behavior is different from other media. This means that developing short-form snackable content is a big opportunity on mobile. We're working hard to help marketers adopt mobile-first video ad strategies for Facebook and Instagram.
In a mobile environment, native mobile video ads typically outperform more traditional ads. For example, when Tropicana launched its probiotic juice, the company tested 6-second video ads against 15 and 30-second ads. The shorter ads resulted in higher brand metrics across the board, including a 16-point lift in brand awareness compared to a 6-point lift for the longer ads.
Our second priority is developing innovative ad products. We're listening closely to feedback from marketers around the world to develop new ad formats and innovate on existing ones. Last quarter, I talked about how our Dynamic Ads help retailers and e-commerce companies promote their products across devices. Dynamic Ads show people the products that are most relevant to them based on actions they've taken, such as viewing items on a company's website.
This quarter, we continued to improve Dynamic Ads and extended them to new verticals and categories. Delta Airlines used our new flight format to reach people who had searched for a flight but not yet booked one. Delta was able to run personalized ads based on the routes people viewed on their site and then bring people back to their booking page. This resulted in a 12.7 times return on ad spend.
This quarter we also rolled out ads in Instagram Stories for all types of marketer objectives. As Mark described, Instagram Stories are growing incredibly well and are, therefore, a big opportunity for marketers. From driving brand awareness to increasing sales, businesses can now use full-screen Instagram Stories ads for any goal. For example, Ben & Jerry's created a brand awareness campaign using vertical video in Instagram Stories and saw a 14 point lift in ad recall and a 2 point lift in purchase intent for its new Pint Slices ice cream.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. This means better targeting and better measurement across Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network. Marketers of all sizes are increasingly following our best practices, like optimizing their ads to drive real-world outcomes rather than focusing on proxy metrics such as page likes and video views. 53% of our revenue from SMBs is from campaigns that use these tools and strategies, up from 23% in the beginning of last year.
This quarter, we also added new ways for marketers to improve their targeting and spend more efficiently. For example, we introduced value optimization, which helps businesses show ads to people who are most likely to spend based on previous purchase behavior. We also introduced value-based Lookalike Audiences, which use machine learning to help marketers reach people who are similar to their most valuable current customers.
For example, California-based accessory company, Nomad, built a custom audience of people in the U.S. who bought something on their site, and then created a multi-country Lookalike Audience of people with similar characteristics. They targeted ads to their international audience across Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network, resulting in a 2.7 times return on ad spend.
We know that many marketers want to verify and compare results across platforms, and that's why we're focused on giving our clients more options for third-party measurement and verification. We now have 24 partners in our measurement system, including three partners measuring viewability, and we're in the process of adding two more viewability partners, DoubleVerify and Meetrics.
As the first half of 2017 comes to a close, we feel good about the progress we're making. As marketers build more meaningful connections with people on mobile, we help them grow their businesses, which in turn grows ours. I continue to be grateful to our clients and partners all around the world and to our global team to make all of this possible.
Thanks, and now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Echoing Mark and Sheryl's comments, Q2 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We continue to see strong growth and engagement in our global community as well as momentum in our mobile ads business. Let's begin with our community metrics.
In June, 1.32 billion people visited Facebook on an average day, up 17% compared to last year. This number represents 66% of the 2.01 billion people that visited Facebook during the month of June, which was up 294 million or 17% compared to last year.
Our community growth was again driven by product improvements on Android, our Internet.org effort, and ongoing third-party promotional data plans in markets like India. We will begin lapping the impact of these promotions in Q3 of this year.
We're also pleased to see strong adoption and community growth across video, Instagram Stories, Messenger, and WhatsApp. While these products do not monetize at the same level as News Feed, they are providing new ways to build global communities.
Turning now to the financials, all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $9.3 billion, up 45%. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with last year, total revenue would have been approximately $140 million greater, or up 47%. Q2 total ad revenue was $9.2 billion, up 47% or 49% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue growth was strong globally. Rest of World and Asia-Pacific grew at 56% and 54% respectively, while the U.S. and Canada and Europe grew at 45% and 43% respectively.
Mobile ad revenue was $8 billion, up 53%, and represented approximately 87% of ad revenue. Desktop ad revenue grew 17% despite an ongoing decline in desktop usage. Note that our Q2 desktop ad revenue benefited from our efforts to limit the impact of ad blocking technologies.
In Q2, the average price per ad increased 24%, and the number of ad impressions increased 19%, primarily driven by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram. Payments and other fees revenue was $157 million, down 20%. Total expenses were $4.9 billion, up 33%.
We ended Q2 with over 20,000 employees, up 43% compared to last year. Our hiring growth rate increased for the third consecutive quarter, as we continued to invest in the many opportunities ahead.
Q2 operating income was $4.4 billion, representing a 47% operating margin. Our tax rate was 13%. In the quarter, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our effective tax rate by 6 percentage points.
Net income was $3.9 billion or $1.32 per share. Q2 capital expenditures were $1.4 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, office facilities, and network infrastructure. We generated over $3.9 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with over $35 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook, growth engagement and advertising demand remain healthy, but there are certain factors that will impact revenue growth that are worth mentioning. As we have discussed before, we continue to expect that Facebook ad load will play a less significant factor driving advertising revenue growth going forward, and that desktop ad revenue growth rates will slow in the second half of 2017 when we begin to lap efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers.
In addition, we expect that our strategic focus on driving engagement with mobile video may slow advertising impression growth, given the relatively fewer ad impressions in video relative to News Feed. I would also note that we do not see our early efforts in Messenger monetization offsetting the factors that I just mentioned.
For these reasons, we continue to expect that our ad revenue growth rates will come down as the year progresses. We continue to expect full-year 2017 payments and other fees revenue to decline compared to full-year 2016.
Turning now to the expense outlook, based on our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are tightening our initial expense guidance range. We expect that full year 2017 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 40% to 45%, narrowed from our previous range of 40% to 50%. I would note that we expect to accelerate our head count growth rate in the second half of the year, as we remain solidly in investment mode. We also expect that our video content investments will contribute to operating expense growth in the second half of 2017.
In terms of capital expenditures, we expect that full year 2017 CapEx will be in the lower end of the prior range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion. We are ramping our infrastructure investments to support global growth and anticipate more data center building activity in the second half of this year. For example, we recently broke ground on new buildings at our New Mexico and Iowa data centers.
Turning now to tax, as I have previously noted, our tax rate will vary based on our stock price. At the current stock price, we would expect that our Q3 and full-year 2017 tax rates will both be similar to our Q2 rate.
In summary, the first half of 2017 was a strong period for Facebook, both financially and in terms of growth and engagement of our community. We will continue to invest aggressively in the many opportunities we see ahead, as we make progress on our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
With that, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Mark. Mark, the offerings on the core Facebook app have improved and changed a lot over the years from Groups, Live Video Search, et cetera. I'm curious to hear how you've noticed consumer behavior on the core product, the core Facebook app change as Instagram has grown. And how do you think about that evolving over the next three to five years? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So the main value proposition for the Facebook app is helping people share any type of content that they want with any audience that matters to them. So you can go from text to photo to video, from small groups to larger groups, from your friends to everyone in the world. And that's always been where the Facebook app has excelled. There have been different experiences that are more focused on specific things. But with a strong technological foundation supporting all of these different use cases, the Facebook app has always supported people using all of them.
Now the biggest trend that we see in consumer behavior is definitely video. And there's a strong technological underpinning for that, which is that if you go back five years and you tried to watch a video on your phone, it would probably have to buffer for a minute or so before you'd actually get to watch it, which wasn't a good experience. And if you wanted to upload a video, whether it was a longer video like what you'd post to News Feed or a 10-second story like what you'd post in any of the apps, even that might take 30 seconds to upload, so it wasn't a good experience.
So now as the technology on the network level improves to support that, what we're seeing is the ability to serve what is a large amount of demand for what's a very engaging type of content. And that demand flows across social content like we're seeing in Stories and Feed to clearly a huge amount of public content. Pages are engaging in this, and some of the trends that Dave just talked about for just a lot of video behavior across the platform.

Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Schackart from William Blair.
Ralph Edward Schackart - William Blair & Co. LLC
Good afternoon. Mark, in the prepared remarks you talked about Messenger and WhatsApp being on the early innings of monetization, and then you also talked about your desire to move faster on Messenger. Just curious what are the factors driving your willingness to move faster. And then how should we think about that both from a consumer and monetization experience? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
On Messenger, there are two basic things that we're doing. One is we're starting to put some ads into the product just to see the basic parameters around how that performs, how people like the ads or don't, how they work for businesses, and just try to get an understanding of that. So we're starting to run that across the world. But as Dave said, even though we're starting to roll that out in a lot of places, the volume starts off pretty small. The biggest strategic thing that we really need to do in messaging right now is make it so that people organically interact with businesses and that that is a good interaction both for people and for the businesses.
So here's one way to think about this. If you're a business and you have a higher ROI for interacting with a person in your messaging thread than you do on the mobile web or trying to get them to install an app, then that creates this positive feedback loop, where you're going to point your ads towards the Messenger thread. You're going to invest more of your engineering resources in building out the content and experience on the Messenger thread.
So we're currently working on making it so that that is the highest ROI thing. I think we're making progress there. It's not that we're going to crack every market at once, but in sum I think we're definitely getting there. We're getting some positive feedback from the market. But once we start to achieve that in more and more verticals, I think that's going to start unlocking a lot of behavior, and a lot of businesses are going to want to push more interactions to happen there, which I think will really be the foundation for building that into a big business.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Ralph, it's Dave. I would just add that with messaging
monetization, this is early and it's not a near-term overall Facebook growth driver. And much like Instagram in its early days, we're going to be cautious. But unlike Instagram, this isn't a feed product, so just there are more unknowns here.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great, thank you. I was wondering. Sheryl talked a little bit about Instagram Stories. I was wondering if you could share with us the initial feedback from advertisers. Do they see it as similar to advertising in the IG feed, or are they using it to reach people in a different way, if you've noticed anything over the period that you've been doing it? Thank you.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
So it's pretty early for ads in Stories. And I think the way people largely think about this is this is another way of using the Facebook ad system, including our targeting and measurement capabilities, to create ads that are great creative that can reach people. So the fully immersive format with the targeting and optimization of Facebook ads is a pretty unmatched opportunity. We also have a huge opportunity within Instagram. And obviously, the use of ads in Instagram is much, much bigger than the use of ads in Stories.
The way we think about this is we're trying to help marketers reach their customers, both their existing and their new customers, effectively. And we think it's a combination of all these offerings that really are the strength of our business and explains why we can continue to grow. So within one interface, we're working with one sales rep. If you're a large company or a small company, you can buy Facebook. You can buy Instagram. You can buy Audience Network. You can buy the different ad formats within Facebook and Instagram. And that means that you have multiple targeting opportunities, multiple opportunities, and even opportunities to see who engages in an ad in one place and then reinvest to continue the conversation with those customers. So we think all of these things work together. And these new formats fit in really nicely with the ad system we built, which underlies all of the opportunity.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks, good afternoon, one for Sheryl, if I could. Sheryl, you guys have rolled out some initiatives designed to address specific advertising categories like Dynamic Travel Ads. Could we anticipate more efforts going forward to address categories that may be relatively underpenetrated by Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network? I'm thinking about categories like financial services, auto, for example. Thanks.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
So we're really happy that our growth has been really strong across our verticals, and that continues to be the case. Our top verticals are pretty consistent in e-commerce, CPG, entertainment, media, retail, and gaming. For the most part, when we build products, we build them to work for all verticals, and you see us do that. So being able to upload your catalog of products can be used no matter what your product lists are. We do build vertical-specific ad products when they are necessary, so Dynamic Ads for travel, for example, as you mentioned, being an example.
I think the heaviest lifting of the work we do is really helping marketers in different verticals focus on the right metrics, which are the sales metrics, because for too long our industry has been focused on proxy metrics, how long someone viewed a video, even brand lift, measurements we care about, but these are all proxy metrics. What really matters is you see an ad and you buy a product. You see an ad and you drive a car off a lot. You see an ad and you order a service.
And so there are very different processes with these different verticals in terms of helping them understand their own purchasing data so that we can connect our ads to their ultimate purchases. We believe that's one of the most important things that we've been very, very focused on, and we have a long way to go. And part of the results you see from us in different verticals are actually explained by the ability of us to help those marketers measure sales at the end of the day. The more that we can tie ad viewing to sales, the stronger our case is with our clients, and so we need to do a lot of work around the measurement with different verticals.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great, thanks for taking the question, two, if I could. Mark, you visited many different parts of the country over the last several months. Just curious how you're applying what you've learned to Facebook and the broader platform.
And then, Dave, can you just give some more color on how things have changed in terms of OpEx and CapEx, just given that you're coming down toward the lower end of the ranges? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So a lot of the themes around building community and bringing people closer together have been underscored by a lot of the experiences that I've had traveling around. And I've tried to write about them. I don't write about each visit that I make on Facebook. But it's been really striking to me when you talk to folks in a lot of different communities how important local institutions and their local communities are for supporting people there.
And there's been a clearly documented trend across the world of declining membership in a lot of different kinds of communities. And I think that that's an important problem that is eating at the social fabric not only of our country but around the world that I hope that we can play a role in addressing. And that's not something that we can do directly, but I believe that we can empower people who want to build local communities and want to play a leadership role in their local community to have the tools that they need. And I think if we can do that, then you start bringing people together at a local level. And when people feel more comfortable in their lives at a local level, then I also think that that helps bring people and bring the world closer together at a global level too.
So that all has been underscored by a lot of the visits and what I've seen as well as a lot of the research that we've done at Facebook, and it's all reflected in the new mission.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Doug, it's Dave. I don't think there's anything that's really fundamentally changed. We are tightening the range to 40% to 45% expense growth due to better visibility. We remain solidly in investment mode. And if anything, we're finding new opportunities to invest in.
From the perspective of hiring growth, I'd really point to the fact that we've been consistently accelerating hiring so far in 2017, and I pointed to the fact that we expect to accelerate hiring in the back half of the year as well. And this quarter was the biggest recruiting quarter in terms of net hires ever for Facebook.
We're continuing to invest in a number of key areas, hiring engineers to drive the three, five, and 10-year priorities. We're going to be investing in content to help build a platform for content producers to find an audience and monetize. We are also continuing to invest in areas like community operations and other areas. So, we remain solidly in investment mode from a total expense point of view.
On CapEx, we still expect to be within the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, and we're investing aggressively in our data center footprint to support the global growth that we see. So, I think across the board, we're investing heavily.
On head count, I would just point out that our payroll growth tends to lag head count growth, because head count is an end-of-period number, so the acceleration that we're seeing in 2017 will obviously play out in 2018 as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great, guys, a couple questions on the messaging apps. I think two years ago at F8, you talked about WhatsApp user base about really north of 1 billion sending out 50 billion messages a day, and Messenger was about 1 billion and 20 billion messages a day, so implying kind of like 2.5 times the engagement on WhatsApp compared to Messenger. Is that accurate? And where does that stand today? And then both of these messaging apps started in different geographies around the world. So, how does that impact your thinking around monetization ideas between Messenger and WhatsApp? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think we're sharing detailed stats on engagement by messaging platform. They're obviously both critical platforms. Both have over 1.2 million monthly actives. And WhatsApp has demonstrated significant engagement with crossing 1 billion daily actives. So, I think that indicates the engagement that you have on that platform. There are different geographies where the messaging platforms are stronger. And depending on that, that shifts our priorities in different ways.
But overall, from a monetization perspective, I think the strategy there is clear. We're focused on growing the user base, first and foremost. And then secondly, it's about building organic connections between businesses and consumers. And then third, it's about how do we build monetization around those relationships. And I think there, we're further along with Messenger than we are with WhatsApp. And so, I think you see us rolling out the global beta there with ads. So, I think we'll watch and learn from that. And as we learn things, we can apply them in other areas.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. Maybe a question for Mark. I know video is a priority for the company. To start with, any change in user trends or engagement as you've added video to Facebook? And then secondly, just how do you think about semi-professional or professional video for Facebook? Is that a good business, given all the content-sharing costs and the production costs when you compare it to your existing social business? And do you see it as cannibalistic or additive as far as usage? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
I can share a little bit about it, then Mark would want to jump in on any other color. I mean, I would say, as I mentioned, Justin, in my commentary, as people spend more time with video, and more time is going to video, that is going to have a limiting factor to how much time they spend in News Feed. And so, that's going to have an impact on impression rate growth. So there is, in that sense, a cannibalistic effect of sorts that happens there.
But what Mark alluded to was video is where people – as networks improve and devices improve and our products improve, video is the most engaging experience that we can offer. And so, we're seeing consumers adopting that and we're building products for them. In terms of the types of content, I think we're looking at a wide variety of content from – of course, at the core is people sharing experiences in their lives. And that's at the base of what we offer in terms of bringing the world closer together. It's that community content. But then there's opportunities for semi-professional and professional content. And we're exploring things around the platform of making sure that we're a platform where professional content providers can come, find an audience, and then also monetize that audience.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I think you pretty much got it.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks. Mark, I wanted to ask a question on conversational interfaces, and specifically if we should think of Facebook becoming integrated as the skill app or feature on platforms such as Alexa, or should we think of things like Oculus, Messenger, and perhaps even a dedicated device as part of Facebook's own alternative platform? And then, Dave, just hoping you can put a finer point on the timing around the reduction in ad load growth. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I mean, to the first question, we're going to build the services that we think are useful. Some of them are going to be platforms and some of them are going to be apps and different things on top of platforms that other folks build. But fundamentally, we're trying to serve our community the best we can, and we'll do that across all these platforms.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. And in terms of ad load growth, I pointed to the fact that we continue to expect that ad load will be a less significant factor in the remainder of 2017, and that's certainly the case. That starts in Q3, but there's a number of other factors that I also pointed to, including the desktop lapping some of the efforts we made on desktop in terms of unblocking or working against the ad blocking technologies. And so, that has a factor on desktop growth. And then of course, I talked about video and our focus on driving and serving the consumer demand for video, and that's also leading to potentially lower impression growth as well.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield from BTIG.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On one of your blogs, you put a post up basically detailing basically what people were doing during TV, and you showed a control group where Facebook usage was really constant. And then you did a group that was watching the TV show, and you saw huge spikes of Facebook usage during the television – during the ad breaks during the show.
Wondering like, as you go talk to marketers, obviously, TV ratings are down a lot. How does that type of study – I realize it's just one TV show. But as you make the pitch of why are you not shifting dollars faster to Facebook, how does that type of research start to play into their thinking? And what's holding them back? Is it just the creative doing, or the embracing of 6-second ads? What's the block to getting more of that $70 billion of TV ad dollars to shift over faster? Thanks.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
That was just one study, and I don't want to overstate its importance in how we sell ads. We make the case to our clients that consumers are moving to mobile and that they need to move to mobile. And not that mobile should replace all of their other advertising, but responsible marketers with great companies, large and small, still advertise on TV, and they advertise on mobile, and they advertise in other places. Our goal is to be the best dollar and the best minute anyone spends, and the case we make is that we want them to take advantage of the opportunity that is mobile and the opportunity for the targeting we offer and the measurement we offer.
I think what has taken us time and continues to take us time is we need to convince marketers to make mobile-first video and other ad formats. We talk a lot about how the first TV ads were people reading their radio ads in front of microphones. And we're still in the case that when people go to put an ad on mobile, they often will take an ad that's really produced for TV and put it on mobile. And those work and they can work well, but they do not work as well as ads that are natively mobile, like the Tropicana example I shared in my earlier comments. Mobile ads when they're video are shorter. The brand comes in faster. They tell a story that doesn't evolve but really gets you to understand the brand and the offering really quickly. We talk about it as thumb-stopping creatives.
And so the work that we have cut out for us is to help marketers and working with their agencies evolve the format of the ads so that they're optimized for mobile, optimized for Facebook, optimized for Instagram. I think we're making progress, but we have a long way to go there.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great, thanks. Mark, you talked about maybe trying to accelerate a little bit the messaging monetization end. I'm wondering if there's anything more behind that statement. Is it that you were frustrated with the level that you had seen to date, or that you saw some opportunity that you thought you could accelerate the push towards I guess monetizing?
And maybe big picture, I want to ask. I know the monetization is very early stages. It's barely even begun. There's very few platforms around the world that have got 1 billion users that are unmonetized, so you would think that there's a lot of opportunity there, but maybe not. And maybe people are making a mistake in trying to look at Asian assets and seeing what they've done there and thinking that you can do with your asset. So what's the upside? When you think about the real opportunity, what gets you excited about the ability to monetize those assets five years from now?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So we're currently going through the process of figuring out what we want to invest in over the next year and doing our long-range planning, and this is certainly one of the areas where I think we want to be investing a lot more in and believe that there's a big opportunity and can accelerate all the effort.
I do think, as you say, this is one of the rare times in business where you can look at messaging platforms that exist and see how they've successfully monetized in other parts of the world and have that be a floor. I think that over time, we should be able to do better, but that at least provides this existence proof that despite – regardless of what our internal logic is of what we're doing, that someone has done it. So that gives us some degree of confidence there in addition to our own execution on other things.
But I feel there's a pretty clear playbook that we have here of first building up the consumer usage, then building up the organic person-to-business interaction, making sure it works for both people and businesses. And then once you have that, the quality of those interactions is really what contributes to the scale of how much you can grow.
We've seen this in News Feed too. One of the factors that's contributed to ad load over time is the quality of the ads. If ad quality was low, we wouldn't be able to put as many ads in because people wouldn't want them. But in a lot of markets around the world, we see that ad quality is increasing at a very fast rate, and that makes it so that a lot of times people do ask for the content, which of course creates a very different dynamic.
So we need to get to that in messaging. And because messaging really started from the place of people communicating one to one with each other and is now adding all these other uses, it's just a lot of investment and a lot of different functionality that needs to get added. But for all the reasons that I've said here around our own experience doing this in other contexts with Facebook and Instagram, proof points in the market of how it's worked, I think over the long term I'm pretty confident that we will get there, and it's our job to just go do that.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
And I would just add. We don't know at what level that is. We've had more experience with feed-based products, so we know how those play out, and so this is in very much early days mode.

Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
John Blackledge - Cowen and Company
Great, thank you, two questions on the Messenger ads. I recognize that it's early days, but just wondering if you think those ads will be more complementary for core Facebook and Instagram advertisers, or perhaps serve a different advertiser base or different use cases versus core Facebook and Instagram.
And then second question will be, at the high end of the OpEx guide, it implies 53% year-over-year OpEx growth in the back half of the year versus plus 36% in the first half. Just wondering if you can discuss other key drivers of the OpEx growth in the back half of the year aside from head count. Should we consider investment in video content the number two driver of OpEx growth in the back half of the year? Thank you.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On the Messenger ads, I think the way we think about it is, as Mark said, we have a lot of work to do to work on the format of that. This is not a feed-based product, and this is a messaging product. So it's a different consumer format, and we believe that the ad format should follow the consumer format, so it's really integrated as part of the experience. And that's where we have a lot of work to do.
We do think that the advertiser base and the targeting and the measurement we offer once we figure out the format will be a very considerable advantage. We already have 5 million advertisers on Facebook, 1 million advertisers on Instagram. And one of the reasons we were able to scale into Instagram ads more quickly is because we were building off of the Facebook advertiser base. And similarly, the work we've done in Facebook and Instagram and Audience Network will help us expand to Messenger.
But we really want to emphasize, especially since there are so many questions on Messenger monetization on this call, that we're going to be slow and deliberate. We are always looking at the long run. We do not manage this company quarter to quarter. We protect the consumer product and the consumer engagement. Messaging is really strategically important for the company and the long-term engagement with our users, and the organic feel of the engagement with businesses and consumers is where we will be focused. So it's early days this year, and it's going to continue to be early days for a while.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
So on the OpEx guide, clearly the biggest driver there is going to be the accelerating head count growth. In addition, I mentioned video content as being a driver. And then also, we're just supporting the global growth of the platform. We continue to see growth in users. We continue to see growth in time spent per DAU across the Facebook family of apps and Facebook, and we're bringing more data centers online and the like towards that growth. So those will start hitting cost of revenue with depreciation.
So there's going to be a variety of contributions to that growth. But like you mentioned, I would point to both head count, specifically in R&D. R&D head count grew 48% year over year in Q2, and that's what's going to be a key driver along with the content layering in.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions. Sheryl, in your prepared remarks about a case study, you discussed the benefits of shorter video ads. But I was hoping you could provide an update on the mid-roll Ad Breaks that you've now been testing for a few months and maybe what kind of progress that you're seeing in terms of completion rates. Are you at a point where Ad Breaks can start to roll out more broadly?
And then, Dave, you mentioned that a greater focus on video could impact growth in ad impressions. But would you also assume that a greater focus on video ads could also drive improved ad pricing and yield on your available inventory? Thanks.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On Ad Breaks, we're currently really just testing the ability to put a short Ad Break in uploaded videos. We do it if a video is longer than 90 seconds or live videos are longer than 4 minutes. We're just in the process right now of expanding to more publishers in the United States, so it's really early.
In terms of the metrics we're looking for, it's a great question. And obviously, we care that people view the ads, but the most important thing is tying those ads impressions, even if they're short views, all the way through to that same purchase data that we keep talking about. And so as we work on rolling out more Ad Breaks, and we are rolling out slowly, we're really focused on finding ways to help marketers measure the right things, and that's a very important focus for the company going forward.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Now, Mark, you were asking about video and its impact on pricing growth. I would probably step back and look at it from an overall system perspective. And so starting with the supply side, there's a variety of factors that will impact impression growth, and I mentioned slower ad growth and then increasing video watch time as being two of them. And given there's an auction that drives the pricing in how we run the business, there's always an interplay between supply growth and pricing growth. And so what we're really focused on is driving better ROI for our advertisers.
And Sheryl alluded to it in her earlier commentary about if we get better at converting our impressions into things that are valuable for advertisers and we get more efficient in doing that, we'll be rewarded with better pricing and higher demand at better pricing as a result of that hard work. That doesn't necessarily specifically pertain just to video. It really is across the board. So if we're effective at continuing to do that, then that should benefit pricing growth. And if we can grow demand faster than we grow supply, then we're going to see that play through in price. And that's really the goal of a lot of the hard work that the ads team does to make our products better and more effective for advertisers.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.
Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC
Thank you. I have one for Dave and one for Sheryl. Dave, going back to your prepared comments, I think you mentioned there was 24% growth in pricing this quarter, in unit pricing. Can you help us explain or understand underlying that growth which products you're seeing the greatest inflation maybe quarter over quarter or year over year?
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
I would really just point to the overall dynamics of the system. And again, what we're seeing is with slower supply growth, that's going to play out to higher pricing. And again, are we effective? And we've been effective at delivering good return on investment for our advertisers and getting better at converting what we have as inventory into what they care about as outcomes. And that from a systemic point of view is what's playing through there.
From a product perspective, as we get things like Dynamic Product Ads rolled out, those are incredibly valuable. As we connect more advertisers with those and bring more data into the system and we can get more of the impressions that are very highly targeted and very relevant, then we'll be rewarded with better pricing as we can expand that out into things like Lookalikes. We've talked a lot about it on this call. That basically takes some of that really good targeting and extends that into a much bigger audience, and then we can get more impressions at better value because we're really connecting that with end results that the advertisers value. So it's really all that type of work that we do to get the system better and better, and so we're constantly working to get better penetration of these key ad products.
In terms of the supply side, obviously News Feed is incredibly valuable because it's very present for the consumer. And we've improved the quality of the ads in News Feed, and that's another driver from the supply side.

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Sanderson from MKM Partners.
Rob J. Sanderson - MKM Partners LLC
Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. It already feels like a call about Messenger monetization, so I'm almost reluctant to ask another, but just two things. Compared to what you saw in the early phases of testing News Feed ads, what can you say so far about users' responsiveness to ads in Messenger?
And then second, obviously, there's a lot of momentum in the development of bots on the platform. And do you see this enabling of great organic interactions, as Mark put it, as a way to ultimately make Messenger a great ad platform, or do you think that enabling these other business services can lead to other monetization opportunities down the road, independent of advertising?
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
It's really too early to understand the impact of the ads on consumers because there aren't enough of them and they haven't been rolled out for long enough. In terms of the bots, what we really think about is our businesses and people making useful connections on both sides on Messenger or any platform. If the connection is useful for marketers, businesses, and useful for people, then it will grow. And we're open to automated bots being useful. We're open to other forms of things being useful.
I think when you think about what bucket of spend that is in, which is a question we get, it really is both marketing spend and any other spend companies have where they're reaching their customers, of which if you think about marketing spend and customer service spend, marketing spend is way bigger, because marketing spend grows as you can grow sales. And customer service spend is something that people generally try to minimize. So, the way we think about it is we want to grow the organic connections, whether they're automated or whether they're personalized, and make sure that that is growing the business of our customers.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment on how you think the European Commission's GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] and related privacy initiatives will impact the business, either generally positively, negatively, and whether or not those policies around privacy might yet become global standards. I'm curious how you think that impacts both the consumer product as well as the advertising business.
And maybe separately, I'm just curious if among those advertisers who have expressed particular concern around third-party tool access, we certainly heard from some who have said very publicly that they're going to reduce their spending. Obviously, others clearly are increasing their spending. But curious how far you've gone towards allaying those concerns and possibly regaining any lost spend.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
When we think about any regulatory issue, GDPR or anything else, we respect local laws and regulations. And we have to work really closely with regulators to make sure they understand our business practices, understand how we contribute to economic growth in their countries, and understand the steps we take and continue to take to protect privacy. Certainly, regulation is always an area of focus that we work hard to make sure that we are explaining our business clearly and making sure regulators know the steps we take to protect privacy as well as making sure that we're in compliance.
When you think about the metrics question you asked, how we think about what is – so what I think you're asking about is third-party verification. We're very interested in making sure that marketers can verify or measure outcomes through third-parties, and that's why we're working to actively expand those partnerships.
Operator
The next question is from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks for taking the question. Another one on Messenger. So, you guys have talked of building – the importance of building organic consumer-to-business interaction here. So wondering if you can share what sort of adoption you are seeing in those kind of interactions. And are there certain verticals or geos where it's really taking off?
And then a second, if I can. We've talked a lot, obviously, already about ad impression growth and how it's set to slow in the second half. You're already seeing a big slowdown in impression growth in the first half. And yet, as you've noted, with supply growth slowing, pricing has gone up, as you've added a lot of ROA as to your customers. So wondering why should this phenomenon not continue to carry ad revenue growth in the second half?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I'll take this. So, there have been a number of questions about Messenger. And in general, we're seeing – I'm happy with the rate of growth in the experiences that we're seeing on Messenger. But if there's one message here that I think is actually important to say, it's that we're trying to communicate that the pace of growing the Messenger business, it's a longer-term thing. I actually think over the next couple of years or few years, the much bigger driver of the business and determinant of how we do is going to be video, not Messenger.
Messenger, I think, is a really important thing and WhatsApp over a three- to five-year period, and we're investing a lot in it. I think it's a huge opportunity. But as has been noted on the call, video is both at large scale and the economics are quite different from the current feed-based businesses that we have today, especially around how, with mid-roll ads and rev share around that, the margin structure will be different.
So, I mean, one of the big questions that we're focused on as we build this out, we're very committed to building it out because it's what people in the community want. But one of the big things that we're really very focused on is making sure that we get this right so that even though this business will likely be – not likely, I think almost certainly will be a lower margin source of revenue than the current thing that we do, there's this big question of how incremental is that behavior going to be.
And I'm just throwing this context out there because so many of the questions here today have been about Messenger, and I want to make sure on these calls that we do an accurate and a full job of conveying what we're actually thinking about as a business and what we think the outlook is going to be. And I think that those questions around video, which I'm optimistic about, but there are real questions there that we need to manage well, is going to be a much bigger driver of the business over the next two to three years likely even than the trajectory of what we're doing on Messenger and WhatsApp.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
And, Lloyd, you asked about why the good work that we've done so far in basically providing value for advertisers is playing through into price. Look, that's not just happening. That's a bunch of hard work that goes into making our ads more targeted that makes the outcomes that advertisers get more valuable. We're going to continue to work to do that, and we're going to continue to invest in making improvements in the ad products, and we think there are great opportunities to continue to make improvements to ROI.
But obviously, if you have rising prices, it's going to make that work against an upstream trend, so we need to continue to work hard to deliver more value for advertisers in the face of that. So we've got our work cut out for us, and we think we've got a great team working on those challenges.
Deborah Crawford - Facebook, Inc.
Operator, we're going to take one last question.
Operator
The last question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Thanks for taking the question. Mark, you stated that AR mixed reality could be the next computing platform. Obviously, this is way out in the future. But if that implies something so large, how do you think about allocating resources for that? How much are you willing to spend on it, and any new thoughts on how this all evolves? And then related to that, the next iPhone is coming out soon. Do you think that there will be capabilities there that will impact the AR evolution meaningfully? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
This is certainly something that I'm really excited about long term. Not only does it have the possibility of being the next major computing platform, AR and VR together, but I think it has the possibility of being much more social and intuitive and natural than some of the devices that we have today, whether they're computers or phones. So that's why I'm really excited about that.
When you think about AR glasses, the technology and science to build an experience that would be both comfortable to wear and something that people would actually want to wear out in public, that doesn't exist yet. So there's a lot of foundational work that needs to get done there. That's partially why I'm excited about doing the VR work because it doesn't have that constraint. You're not wearing VR out in public. But also recently, one of the things that we've seen is that there are a lot of AR experiences on mobile. So the work that we started talking about at F8 that we are releasing slowly over the course of the year is certainly one of the precursors for building out that ecosystem that I'm excited about.
But look, if I was just saying that video is going to be the primary driver or one of the big drivers over the next few years and Messenger maybe after that, I think AR is quite far down the road. But when you're running an operation and serving people at this scale, I think you have a responsibility to invest in all these things that are downstream that could help shape and improve people's lives, because I don't think that there are that many other folks in the world who will.
So I think that that's a thing that we take seriously, whether it's connectivity and making sure that people actually all around the world get to enjoy and benefit from the opportunities that the Internet has or the improvements that come from AI, or eventually upgrading the computing platforms that we all get to use. This stuff doesn't just happen automatically. And someone in the world needs to focus on building it, and we want to play a role in that.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. We started the year off with a good quarter. Our community continues to grow, with more than 1.9 billion people now using Facebook every month and almost 1.3 billion people using it every day. Our ads business is doing well too. Total revenue grew by 49% year over year to $8 billion, and advertising revenue was up 51% to $7.9 billion.
In my letter to our community back in February, I talked about how for the past decade Facebook has focused on connecting friends and family. Now with that foundation, our next focus will be building community. There's a lot to do here. Building a global community is bigger than any one organization, but we can help by developing social infrastructure for communities, for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for including everyone.
Building a global community that works for everyone starts with building millions of smaller supportive communities. This is especially important, since membership in many physical communities is declining. We recently found that more than 100 million people on Facebook are members of what we call very meaningful groups, like parenting or rare diseases, support groups that are an important part of their support structure. My hope is to help more than 1 billion people join meaningful groups to strengthen our social fabric over the next few years.
To help build a safe community, we launched Community Help, a tool that allows people to give and get things like food, shelter, or transportation in the wake of a natural disaster. We also launched a new fundraising tool that allows people to raise money for themselves, a friend, or a cause that isn't already on Facebook.
But it's clear we have more to do here. We're going to continue building new tools to keep people safe on our platform. Over the next year, we'll be adding 3,000 people to our Community Operations team around the world on top of the 4,500 we already have today to review the millions of reports we get every week and to improve the process for doing that quickly.
To help build a more informed community, we make changes to our News Feed ranking to reduce the financial motivation to spread hoaxes. We're working with independent fact-checkers to give people more information on whether an article has been disputed. We launched an educational tool at the top of News Feed in 14 countries to help people spot false news. And we're beginning to test related articles that appear before you read an article, giving you easier access to more perspectives and information.
We're also helping to build a more civically engaged community. In March we launched Town Hall to help people find and connect with their government representatives on a local, state, and federal level in the U.S. In just the first month, we created more than 1 million new connections between people and their representatives. We also rolled out a tool in France ahead of their election that allows candidates to share statements about where they stand on different policy issues. So these are some of the changes we've made to help people build stronger communities.
Next I want to give a quick update on what we're building over our three time horizons, how we're making our core services more useful and engaging right now, how we're building ecosystems around products that a lot of people are already using over the next five years, and how we're investing in the technologies that will give more people a voice and make sharing more immersive over the next 10 years.
This quarter we launched a set of new cameras. Photos and video are becoming more common than text, so the camera is becoming more central then the text box in all of our apps. In the Facebook app, you can now swipe right from News Feed to access our new camera with masks, frames, and filters. We've developed new computer vision tools that can apply the style of a painting to a photo or video, and we can do that in real time on your phone for the first time.
This is part of making the camera the first augmented reality platform. We want to give developers the power to build all kinds of AR tools in the camera so more people can experience augmented reality on their phone. Creating the first open camera platform is a huge step forward, and we're excited to keep pushing augmented reality forward.
We also expanded the Stories format to give people more new ways to share. Instagram Stories now has more than 200 million daily active people using it. And just a couple months after we launched it, WhatsApp Status has more than 175 million daily active people using it. More recently, we also rolled out Messenger Day and Facebook Stories, and we're going to keep putting video at the center of all these services.
Over the next five years, we're going build ecosystems around our products that a lot of people are already using. I put live video in this category. Last month we announced that one in every five Facebook videos is a live broadcast. And over the past year, daily watch time for Facebook Live broadcasts has grown by more than four times.
This year we also gave people the ability to go live in 360. Messenger is in this category too. And we just announced that 1.2 billion people use Messenger every month. At F8, we launched the second generation of our Messenger platform and introduced the Discover tab to make it easier to find the best experiences quickly.
Finally, over the next 10 years, we're developing consumer use cases around technologies that are a big part of our future, but won't be a part of our business, a big part of the business for a while. On the connectivity side, in April we successfully simultaneously beamed 16 gigabits of data in each direction between a location on the ground and a Cessna aircraft circling more than 7 kilometers away. Eventually, we're going to use this technology along with Aquila, our solar powered plane that we're building, to beam Internet to parts of the world that currently don't have access.
In virtual reality, we launched Facebook Spaces, the first social VR platform that lets you create your own avatar and hang out with your friends. And we also released the Facebook 360 app for Gear VR that makes it easier to discover and experience in 360 photos and videos. And we continue to ship RIFT and Touch to people everywhere and deliver a strong content ecosystem across both RIFT and Gear VR.
As people share more video, as we explore more things like augmented reality, and as we build more tools to keep our community safe, we're going to keep investing aggressively in the infrastructure that we need to grow and serve our community. That's why we announced that our next two data centers will be built in Odense, Denmark and Papillion, Nebraska.
We've made some good progress. We have a lot more to do to help build community and connect the world. I want to thank everyone in our community, our teams, our partners, and all of you for being a part of this journey with us.
And now here's Sheryl.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a strong first quarter and a great start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 51% year over year. Mobile ad revenue was $6.7 billion, up 58% year over year, and was approximately 85% of total ad revenue. Growth again this quarter was broad-based across regions, marketer segments, and verticals.
Our goal is to build meaningful connections between businesses and people. We're doing this by focusing on three key priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing innovative ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
Our first priority is helping businesses leverage the power of mobile. More businesses around the world are shifting to marketing on mobile. Over 70 million businesses are now using Facebook Pages around the world on a monthly basis, and more and more of them are becoming advertisers. We also recently announced that over 5 million businesses are actively advertising on Facebook, including more than 1 million in emerging markets. Most of these advertisers start by using our free Pages product because it's easy to use.
People are increasingly recognizing that the small screen is big. Our Creative Hub is providing tools that make it easier to create ads optimized for mobile, what we talk about as thumb stopping creative. Marketers can see previews of their ads across Facebook and Instagram before rolling them out and get tips to help drive business results.
Our second priority is developing innovative ad products that help businesses make the most out of their campaigns. We continue to improve Dynamic Ads, which enable advertisers to promote their full range of products across all devices. Advertisers can now target Dynamic Ads to broad audiences and are seeing great results.
Last week I visited home retailer Wayfair in Boston. They use Dynamic Ads to reach a large audience with personalized recommendations from their catalog of over 8 million items. By finding higher revenue customers at a lower cost, the campaign beat Wayfair's return on ad spend goal by more than 20%.
We're also helping marketers use video to capture shoppers' attention. People are watching more video on Facebook than ever before, and it's changing how they connect with businesses. In a recent study Facebook commissioned with Kantar, 30% of mobile shoppers said video is the best way to discover new products.
This quarter, we introduced a new ad format called Collection. Collection helps marketers tell stories on mobile by combining creative videos or photos of product images. Clicking on the products leads to an immersive shopping experience, driving purchase consideration and ultimately sales.
For example, adidas, which is how you pronounce them at their headquarters, and its agency, iProspect, created a video highlighting the innovative future of a Z.N.E. road trip party. Using our Collection ad format, adidas featured four more items from their product catalog below the video. They saw a 5.3 times return on ad spend and a 1.8 times decrease in cost per conversion. It's still early for this new format, but it's a great example of how we can deliver innovative mobile experiences that work for advertisers and work for people.
This quarter we also launched full-screen sound-on ads in Instagram Stories. Advertisers can now reach over 200 million daily actives on Stories to do everything from building brands to selling products.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Measurement is critical. We recently introduced new and expanded verification partnerships and committed to audits with the Media Rating Council. Whether marketers are trying to get people to buy something on their website or in their store, we now have systems in place to help them measure results and third-party partnerships to verify those results. These are important steps as we continue to build the advertiser trough.
Bud Light's NFL campaign is a great example. To promote the designs of their new team-specific cans, Bud Light took a national and regional approach. They ran video ads featuring the new cans to people ages 21 to 49 in the U.S. Then they also ran more targeted ads in each region featuring the two cans of the teams playing each other. Using Facebook polling and Oracle data cloud, they saw a 24-point lift in ad recall and a 4.4 times return on ad sales.
We know marketers want to compare results across platforms and placements. Historically, we've enabled larger marketers to do this. In Q1 we started testing a set of advanced measurement tools that make it easier for marketers of all sizes to compare the effectiveness of Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network alongside other publishers.
We're off to a strong start in 2017. We're helping marketers leverage the power of mobile, developing innovative ad products, and delivering proven and measurable results. We're excited about the growing adoption of our platforms, and we're going to continue to invest in helping businesses and people connect.
Thanks, and now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for Facebook. We continued to see healthy growth in engagement trends across our community as well as broad-based growth in our ads business. Let's start with our community metrics.
In March, 1.28 billion people visited Facebook on an average day, up 18% compared to last year. This daily number represented 66% of the 1.94 billion people that visited Facebook during the month of March, which was up 282 million or 17% compared to last year. Our community growth in Q1 was driven by product improvement, internet.org, and ongoing third-party promotional data plans in markets like India. Note that we do not control the timing or terms of these promotions.
Before diving into the financials, I want to highlight that we are no longer reporting non-GAAP expenses, income, tax rate, or EPS. Given that stock is an important part of our compensation structure, we believe that investors should focus on our financial performance with stock-based compensation included.
Turning now to the financials, all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $8 billion, up 49%. Ad revenue was $7.9 billion, up 51%. Exchange rates did not affect our overall growth rate this quarter, as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others.
In terms of regional advertising growth, rest-of-world and Asia-Pacific were our strongest growers in percentage terms at 66% and 60% respectively. Both regions benefited from particularly strong advertiser demand. Europe and North America both grew at 47%.
Mobile ad revenue was $6.7 billion, up 58%, and represented approximately 85% of ad revenue. Desktop ad revenue grew 22% despite a decline in desktop usage and was aided by our recent effort to limit the impact of ad blocking technologies, which we began in Q3 of last year. Our mobile ads business continued to be driven by healthy supply and demand in apps (15:41). In Q1, the average price per ad increased 14% and the total number of ad impressions served increased 32%, primarily driven by mobile feed ads.
Payments and other fees revenue was $175 million, down 3%. Q1 total expenses were $4.7 billion, up 40%.
In 2017, we have continued to accelerate our hiring efforts. We added over 1,700 employees in Q1, predominantly in technical and recruiting functions, and ended the quarter with approximately 18,800 employees, up 38% compared to last year. This marked an acceleration from the 34% growth rate in Q4.
Q1 operating income was $3.3 billion, representing a 41% margin.
Our tax rate was 10%, which reflects the adoption of ASU 2016-9 in the fourth quarter. Excluding this adoption, our tax rate would have been approximately 9 percentage points higher. Note that the new accounting guidance does not impact the cash taxes we pay but merely how the tax provision is presented under GAAP, whereby now excess tax benefits are flowing through the P&L and in this quarter positively impacted EPS.
Net income was $3.1 billion or $1.04 per share.
Q1 capital expenditures were approximately $1.3 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure. In Q1 we also broke ground on our ninth data center in Nebraska.
We generated approximately $3.8 billion in free cash flow. In the first quarter, we repurchased $228 million of our Class A common stock and used $771 million in cash for taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards. We ended the quarter with $32.3 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook, with regards to revenue, we continue to expect that our ad revenue growth rates will come down meaningfully over the course of 2017. We expect that ad loads will play a less significant factor in driving revenue growth after mid-2017. We also expect desktop ad revenue growth rates to slow in the third quarter when we begin to lap our efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers. We continue to expect that our full-year 2017 payments and other fees revenue will decline compared to full-year 2016. As a reminder, payments and other fees revenue is primarily generated from payments related to games played on personal computers.
Turning to the expense outlook, we continue to expect that full-year 2017 GAAP expenses will grow 40% to 50% compared to full-year 2016. I would note that as we look into 2017 and beyond, there are going be a number of initiatives we believe are valuable to the community and to the company in the long term that are going be net negative on our operating margin. We are embarking on a significant ramp up in infrastructure supporting global growth, and we continue to expect that full-year 2017 capital expenditures will be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, which is up over 50% compared to last year.
Turning now to tax, as we noted in the last call, under the new accounting guidance, our tax rate will vary based on our stock price. At current stock prices, we expect that our Q2 and full-year 2017 tax rates will both be in the mid-teens, so up from the first quarter rate.
In summary, Q1 was a strong quarter and a great start to the year. Growth in the Facebook community remains strong. Engagement across our family of apps is healthy and growing, and advertiser demand from our growing base of marketers is robust. Importantly, we continue to invest aggressively to build our business and drive value for our community over the long term.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question, maybe one thematic question on Instagram for Mark and Sheryl. I wanted to understand what you're seeing in terms of the development of the community on the user growth side, the engagement side, as well as on the monetization side with respect to breadth of advertisers and ad product evolution, what that means for Instagram's future and how it compares to maybe what you've learned growing the business on the Facebook side over the last couple years. Thanks so much.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Eric, why don't I take that and then Sheryl can augment with some additional color? So when you think about Instagram, we're seeing great growth there with the community. So this past quarter, we announced 700 million monthly actives, so that was a big announcement. And that's broad-based growth across the globe, so we're pleased with that.
In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know, because that's sold through the same Facebook ad interfaces, but we're seeing really good contribution and good growth there. And we're developing it across a wide variety of ad products, so VR is becoming a more significant part of the Instagram story, where it was originally more brand-focused. But we've expanded the product offerings on the Direct Response front, and we're continuing to bring more ad products to Instagram.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
We're pretty excited about what's happening in the Instagram ad space because Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad platforms. And there's a special property with Instagram, which is that the increasing visualization of ads and the creative canvas it offers with the science behind the Facebook targeting and measurement system is really a pretty unusual combination. We're also seeing very broad adoption, including small customers. We are pretty excited to have 1 million advertisers and 8 million Instagram business profiles on the platform.
To share one example, an online store in Brazil called Loja Nama, they sell decorative items and accessories. Their business owner, Joanna [Cariello], took photos of her products on her phone and then created ads with our Shop Now button. She targeted young audiences in Brazil who are interested in fashion, decoration, movies, and architecture. And during the period of her campaign, Instagram accounted for 79% of her sales. And I think what that shows is the power of the very sophisticated targeting we offer across our platforms along with really the ability to use very simple tools like a phone to create very sophisticated but visually compelling ads.

Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question, one for Mark and then perhaps one for Sheryl or Dave. Mark, first just on the video strategy, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how that's evolving in terms of the type of content that you're licensing and featuring within the Facebook Video tab, and then if you have any more clarity just on how the economics are going to work there around revenue share and gross margins.
And then on ad revenue, the U.S. and Canada was very strong at 47% growth, but at the same time it also did decel a little bit more than we've seen in recent quarters. I was just wondering if there was anything else to call out there. Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yes. Doug, why don't I take the decel question on the U.S. and Canada? I don't think there was anything particularly surprising about the deceleration in the growth in the U.S. and Canada. We've been talking about expecting a deceleration in ad revenue growth, and we saw that play out in the U.S. and Canada modestly.
Obviously, we were particularly pleased that there was really strong demand that benefited regions like APAC and rest-of-world, so really broad-based strength in APAC. And then rest-of-world, we saw a rebound in Latin America, especially Brazil, so we're seeing some particular strength there. So I think that I think was a big highlight.
On the content front, we're looking at investing in kick-starting an ecosystem for longer-form content on Facebook, and that involves us working with content providers to develop that content. In the long run, we expect to see a revenue share model on the platform. And obviously, we're going to be in an area where we're sharing revenue with content providers, so it's going to have a different margin profile than core Facebook News Feed from an expense profile perspective.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I think you pretty much got that.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Mark on Messenger monetization. Can you just talk about some of the biggest trends you're monitoring and what you're most excited about as you think about ways to monetize Messenger over the next two or three years?
And then on engagement, you continue to grow Instagram and Messenger user bases really healthily. I guess I'd be curious to hear, do you still continue to see rising time spent per user across all three of those platforms, even as the DAU base gets bigger? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Can you start with the stats, Wehner?
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. Yes, I can start with the stats, Mark. On the engagement front, we're seeing time spent growth per DAU across the Facebook family of apps, and that includes Facebook itself. Instagram has been strong, especially with Feed Ranking and Stories. We're not breaking out specific time spent stats on a quarterly basis on those. And then on the Messenger monetization front...?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I can talk about the strategy. The first thing that we need to do on Messenger and WhatsApp is get a lot of businesses using it organically and build the behavior for people that they reach out to businesses for different things, like customer support or for getting news content, things that may not eventually be the big business use cases but establish the behavior of people interacting not only with their close friends, but also with businesses.
In terms of making money on that, once we have that behavior, I think there are going to be a number of ways that we can amplify that. We're already experimenting with a couple. One is ads that actually display a News Feed, not in Messenger or WhatsApp, but that link to the ability to communicate with a business directly in Messenger or eventually WhatsApp. And that's great, it converts better for the businesses. They can have a better dialogue with the person and a persistent relationship. So that's one way that I think that this will be valuable. The other way is of course eventually showing paid content in Messenger, whether that's in the inbox or in relevant ways throughout the product.
But the top priority right now is just building out the base of organic interaction between people and businesses that they want to interact with. And once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of opportunities to build a business, and the business will be proportional to the amount of that activity that people want to do organically.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Great, thank you, a couple things on advertising and modeling. When we think about Q1, can you help us at all think about how much the ad load growth is contributing and what drove the improvement in pricing in the quarter?
And then, Dave, when you look out to the third quarter and you lap the ad blocking on desktop, are there more ad blocking you can do to help maintain that growth, or are there other drivers there for desktop that we can think about? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, Justin. I'm not breaking out specific drivers on the supply side. Supply growth was healthy, and we had contributions from users' time spent and ad load in the quarter.
In terms of what drove the improvement in the pricing, it's strong demand, so that's playing through in the face of a little bit slower supply growth. And so you're seeing – of course, the auction drives pricing and there has been interplay between the supply growth and the pricing growth, and we're seeing the strong demand play through on the pricing side.
When we get to lapping our efforts on desktop, I do think you're going to – you have a secular trend away from desktop. So that's going be an overall factor in desktop, our ability to grow and maintain the desktop business, so I think that's an underlying factor. We're always going be in a back-and-forth with ad blockers on the desktop side. So I think that's going to constantly be a thing that plays into the desktop revenue.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great, thanks. First off I guess is a follow-up on the earlier video question from Doug. Could you add some perspective on engagement trends with video content and video ads such as average viewing time and whether this mix is what is impacting impression growth? And then more broadly, if you can offer some perspective on how much of the video ad spending on Facebook applications are incremental to television budgets, or if there's any evidence you're seeing of a share shift. Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, Colin. I'll take that first one. So impression growth was 32% in Q1, as I noted, and that was a bit slower than in previous quarters.
Those of you who have been following us for a while know that periodically we make changes to the product that is going to impact some of the metrics. One of the things that I would call out in Q1 as a contributing factor on the impression growth side was our decision to rank longer-form video higher in News Feed. That means more time in video, and that does come at the expense of some impression growth in News Feed. So I think you do see some interplay there on the impression growth side due to our focus on video. And then Sheryl was going to follow up on the video ad spending.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On TV, we are definitely seeing people continue to advertise on TV and use us as a complement. So over time, we believe that the dollar shifts with eyeballs and we want to earn it from our clients and be the best dollar and the best minute they spend and help them measure across channels.
I think increasingly, the question is not if you can do without TV, but it's if you can do without mobile. And we're working hard to help advertisers develop the video creative that really works for mobile because that really makes a really big difference. And we think the combination of the creative working for mobile but also the measurement and targeting we can do is a very powerful offer.
To share one of my favorite new examples, Subway working with their agency 360i developed video ads and images for Facebook and Instagram to promote the limited time offer Reuben sandwich. And they used Audience Insights, targeting people ages 18 to 49 who purchase meat and cheese, and that's just pretty incredible targeting. Nowhere else I don't think you can actually target that way and people interested in fast food and encourage them to visit Subways. They then used Nielsen Brand Effects and were able to measure a 16-point lift in ad recall and a 5-point lift in intent to visit Subway. So it's a really unique combination of the power of creative that was designed for video for mobile with very specific targeting and very specific measurements.

Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thanks, two questions. Mark, you mentioned adding 3,000 reviewers to content at Facebook. Could artificial intelligence be used over time to help solve some of the monitoring? And then just more broadly, how is AI being employed in the processes at the company now versus a couple years ago?
And then second item would be, could newer ad units like mid-roll video help mitigate the decel from the lower ad load growth contribution in second half 2017? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I'll talk to the content and AI questions, and then someone else can talk about the ad piece. The short answer is yes. AI tools over time will be able to do a better job of flagging things for the set of people who are in the Community Ops teams that we can prioritize what we look at. A lot of what we're trying to do here is not just about getting content off Facebook. Last week there was this case where someone was using Facebook Live to broadcast – or was thinking about suicide. And we saw that video and actually didn't take it down and helped get in touch with law enforcement who used that live video to communicate with that person and help save their life. So a lot of what we're trying to do is not just about taking the content down, but also about helping people when they're in need on the platform, and we take that very, very seriously.
Over time, the AI tools will get better. Right now there are certain things that AI can do in terms of understanding text and understanding what's in a photo and what's in a video. That will get better over time. That will take a period of years, though, to really reach the quality level that we want. So for a while, our strategy has been to just continue building as good tools as we can because no matter how many people we have on the team, we're never going to be able to look at everything. So that's going be a big challenge.
But given the importance of this and how quickly live video is growing, we wanted to make sure that we doubled down on this and made sure we provided as safe of an experience for the community as we can, which is why we're almost doubling the size of the Community Ops team to focus on some of these issues around safety on live video. But over time for sure, more AI will do this, but this is over a period of years.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
John, I think your question then was on Ad Breaks and then the mid-roll type of format. I think there we're testing the ability and are putting short Ad Breaks into longer-form live and on-demand videos. Tests are going well, but it's really early days to talk about that being a significant contributor, so we're working to continue to make those products better and continuing those tests, but it's early. On that front, we're focused on building out the best video experiences for our community and growing longer-form content as a priority. And Ad Breaks is going to allow us to have a monetization strategy with that longer-form content. But like I said, it's early.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thank you. I guess I had a question just related to Instagram and Facebook Stories. We've talked a lot about ad load growth over the last year, and Dave's been talking about the pending slowdown, which I think we're all expecting. But how do we think about these new applications or new ways to engage with the apps at the top of your phone, where you're starting to see ad insertion show up as well? Is that thought of as different than the general ad load comments that, Dave, you're making? I'm sorry to split hairs here, but I'm just trying to get a sense of how to think about when they're starting to show up in new places.
And then I guess I just had a follow-up for Sheryl. And one question in particular was if there's any measurement metrics that advertisers are asking for now that if you could help them with, it would make them even more eager to shift their budgets over from TV and follow their eyeballs? Sorry, thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
So, Heather, on Stories, again, it's a pretty similar answer, I think, to Ad Breaks in the sense that it's early in terms of using the ads formats in Stories. We've certainly rolled those out. They are not in the ad load calculation per se. So it is different, as you said, from the ad load commentary that I've given. But obviously, it's very early on those products. And then, Sheryl, you had the question about measurement metrics.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yes, we know that measurement is so critical, and we really want to measure core business results and focus on becoming the number one growth driver for our clients. We are continuing to constantly review our metrics. When we find bugs or errors, we're reporting them to our clients and addressing the issue and continuing with that analysis as we work through all of our metrics.
We're also very focused on extending measurement partnerships and third-party verification. This last quarter we extended viewability measurement to the Audience Network, added another verification partner, DoubleVerify, for video and display measurement, and introduced our MMM [Marketing Mix Modeling] portal so that we can help people measure across all of the different platforms and compare the effectiveness of their ad spend no matter what their end goal is.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura Instinet.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet
Thank you very much. I have one for Mark and one for Sheryl. Mark, at F8 and in your comments today, you talked about making the camera central to the app, making the camera the first augmented reality platform. I know it's early, but can you maybe share with us your thoughts about the potential commercial application of augmented reality as you see it today?
And then, Sheryl, there's been more lately about the use and effectiveness of influencer marketing on both Facebook and Instagram. How is Facebook thinking about sharing in the economics of when brands use celebrities or influencers to market their products using their Facebook posts? Is it by bringing more transactions onto the platform, building on the shopping experience on Facebook? How is Facebook going to share in those economics? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
All right, I can start by talking about augmented reality. The big step forward that we announced at F8 is that there are lots of different apps that have cameras in them or that independent developers just build an app that has a single camera effect. But what we're basically saying is that there's so much innovation and so many different types of effects that people are creating that we don't want developers to have to build their own separate app and get to a huge scale in order to build some new kind of visual tool.
So we built – we're making the cameras inside the whole family of apps into the first augmented reality platform, into an open platform, which is different from what any other app that has a camera has done before. It's going to open up a much greater diversity of use cases, not only making it so that use cases like facemasks or style transfers that we already have, you're now going to have thousands of options instead of just 10 or 20 at a time. But there are also going to be all these new kinds of things that we're not even building today that developers will be able to experiment with.
One of the examples I showed at F8 was around using object recognition and computer vision to be able to point your camera at something and then tap on it and get a card of information and maybe even a buy button. So there are lots of different ways that over time this kind of content is going to both augment existing real-world objects and eventually replace them, which I think is going to be an interesting opportunity. maybe not on augmented reality on the phone but on glasses eventually.
When you have that, I think we're going get to a point where things like TVs, you no longer need a physical TV. You'll get a $1 app that you can watch it screen on. And it will just be an interesting exercise to see how many of the things that we have that are physical things don't actually need to be physical in that world, and how much innovation that opens up for independent developers all around the world. A lot of people don't have a factory, so they can't build a TV. But think about how many kids and different developers around the world, kids sitting in dorm rooms and all these different places are going be able to create things that today they couldn't.
So I hope this is going to create a pretty interesting economy. So a lot of that stuff is pretty far out, five, ten years. But we want to be pushing this forward. I think we're a little bit late to the trend initially around making cameras the center of how sharing works. But I do think at this point, we're pretty much ahead in terms of the technology that we're building, and making it an open platform I think is a big is a big step forward. A lot of people are using these products across our family of apps, and I would expect us to continue leading the way forward on this from this point on.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
When you think about influencer marketing, we definitely see publishers interested in it, brands interested in it. And so we've worked on branded content, the ability to tag a sponsor and share posts and insights. And the financial arrangement remains between the sponsor and the publisher. It's early, but we're seeing some positive results with publishers of many different types bringing branded content to Facebook. In Q1, we opened this up to unverified pages so we could enable more people to take advantage of this kind of targeting.
We see this in the broader context of better targeting. When you think about what really drives great performance for both people who are using Facebook but for marketers, it's well-targeted ads. And so influencer marketing is one way to get there, but we're focused on a very full range of ability to target well. We've been really pleased with the adoption of our targeting products from Custom Audiences to Lookalikes to Dynamic Ads, and we think all of these can improve the relevance of the ad by making ads more targeted, because when they're more targeted, they have higher returns for marketers and they're more enjoyable or relevant for people.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great, thanks. First, I think it's a great move to go all-in GAAP in terms of reporting. Second, David, when you talked about the ads, your ad load commentary, I couldn't tell if there was a subtle shift there when you were saying that the ad load pressure would occur after the end of the year rather than in the second half of the year.
And then third, this is for Sheryl and Mark. The recent stories about gender bias amongst engineers at Facebook, and I know you quickly responded to that and said if there were anything, there may be a rank bias, but in my mind it creates the opportunity potentially for Facebook to better tap into what is probably underappreciated female engineering talent in the Valley and across technology. How do you think about that as an opportunity for the company? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
I'll just real quickly address the ad load issue, Mark. Sorry if it wasn't clear, really no change in outlook there. We continue to expect that we'll see deceleration in ad revenue growth. And that's going to be particularly pronounced as we get into the second half of 2017 because ad load will be a less significant factor driving growth starting in the second half.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On the issue you raised with the Facebook female engineers, I'm really glad to have a chance to address this because this is an issue I take very seriously. On the specific report on this study, the study was conducted by a former employee with very incomplete data. When that study was shared with people internally, and we have that culture where people do studies and share things, and we're really glad because that helps surface issues, we immediately conducted our own research using the full data.
And what we found is that the main reason code was sent back at different rates was not correlated with gender. It was correlated with level, and the fact that we have more male senior engineers was explaining it. If you compared male and female engineers at the same level, there was not this discrepancy.
Then that leads to the obvious question is are you promoting men and women at the same rate and the broader question of are you paying men and women fairly. And we do a comprehensive look at that every single promotion and pay and performance cycle we have, which is six months. And we know that we're promoting men and women at the same rate as men.
Now that said, our industry still has issues and we still have issues. We don't have enough senior female engineers. We don't have enough women going into computer science, and we take this very seriously, from the work we've done with LinkedIn to get CS&E Lean In circles all over college campuses, to encourage more women and under-represented minorities to come into our field. We've had a really nice program in extra internships where we're taking people who are not yet majoring in computer science but we think have the ability, and teaching them for a summer and seeing them return, to the work we're doing with our female engineers to make sure that all forms of bias are surfaced and eliminated. And we can continue to use the full talents of the population. Nothing is more important to us.

Your next question comes from the line Ross Sandler from Barclays.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, guys. Just had two questions on video. We know it's early, but what kind of traction do you see with the video tab that's in beta? And do you think longer term the video consumption is going to be in that dedicated tab, or will it stay in the News Feed based on what you're seeing right now?
And then, Dave, just to follow up on your previous answers, so are the costs related to video ad rev share or licensing of video content, is that baked into your OpEx guidance for 2017, or is that something that will step up after this year? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I don't know if we have any public stats on the video tab, probably not. But in terms of the strategy, I can talk about that quickly. There were two basic use cases for checking in with Facebook and seeing what's going on in the world. What people do with News Feed a lot of the time is they have a few free minutes, or you want to sit down for maybe a longer session to see everything that's going on in the world. You don't have a specific intention to watch a specific type of content. You just want to check in and see what's going on in the world.
There's this whole other use case around content, which is going to the app or sitting down at a TV because there's some content that you want to watch and you want to go directly to it. And that's what we're trying to do with the video tab, to make it so that all the different folks, whether they're pages that you follow or creators that you like, who you want to subscribe to and get the updates to what they're doing, that you have a place that you can go to with more intent to consume that content.
The reason why it needs to be a different tab or at least a different service from News Feed is because people come to it with a different intent. I think you're going to start in the future getting people coming to Facebook for the News Feed use case of checking in and people coming with an intent to go to the video tab to watch a specific video. So that's what we're doing there. That's the strategy, and I guess we'll update on stats when we have them.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
And, Ross, on the costs related to the video ad rev share, yes, our guidance on total cost is all-inclusive, so it includes all the R&D investments we're making. It includes the content. It includes things like the Community Operations investments that we talked about today in the announcement. But I would say that the nature of the types of video content deals that we're doing will make them more likely to show up after 2017. So there will be some content expense in 2017, but I think it will be something you will see step up after 2017.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you. Mark, in your prepared remarks, you talked about doing more to foster local communities and groups, and it would seem like one of the more interesting test cases here already is in Local Marketplaces. I was just wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the kind of adoption and engagement that you've seen with Local Marketplaces and maybe anything that you've learned that you can apply to some of the newer initiatives that you're looking at?
And then secondly, probably for Sheryl, for Ad Breaks to scale, it appears that content creators need to adapt their programming for this, and of course, users need to engage with the ads. So I guess the question is how are completion rates for Ad Breaks? I know it's early, but what are you seeing so far? And how would you characterize the willingness of content creators to adapt?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I can talk about Marketplace Groups first. So I think your basic point is right, that the reason why we started working on Marketplace and the tab around that is because when we were exploring what the biggest use cases were of Groups, we uncovered that a very large number of people, hundreds of millions, use Groups to buy and sell different things. And so these whole communities have formed, which was somewhat surprising to us honestly, because we hadn't developed that product specifically for buying and selling. It was for group communication and that's what people were using it for. So we decided hey, we're going to put together a team that's going to invest in making this actually good for buying and selling and see how much we can grow that economy. So I don't know that we have any public stats on that yet, but that's an area that I'm certainly very excited about.
And then in terms of local communities, one of the big trends in the world that we've seen is just that participation in all kinds of different physical communities, whether they're sports teams or some religious groups or different kinds of different things, have been declining a lot over the past several decades. And that I think is a big social issue that is eroding the social fabric of the whole society, not just our country, but around the world. And that's one where I look at that and I wonder if Facebook can play a role in helping to strengthen that.
We look at – there are more than 1 billion people every month who use our Groups product. But if you think about your own use of the Groups product, you probably are a member of a bunch of different groups that you maybe check in on very infrequently. So that's very different from – there's a handful of people, around 100 million or a bit more, who are a member of what we call a very meaningful group. So that could be a parenting group or you're diagnosed with a rare disease, and you can now connect with people all around the world to share stories around that. These are groups that upon joining, they become one of the things that you spend the most time with on Facebook, one of the most important parts of your experience, and a really fundamental part of your real-world support structure.
So we look that that and we ask the question of hey, if 100 million people are in those very meaningful groups today, can we get that to be 1 billion people over next several years? And if so, then that can help reverse some of the decline in community membership and help strengthen the social fabric, not only in our country, but around the world. So that's a big part of what we're focused on across a number of different initiatives.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
And I'll talk a little bit about the Ad Break, what we're seeing. It's really early both in terms of testing the ads and getting any feedback from users, so people who use Facebook, so we don't have that data to share. But we're pleased that the test is active. We're pleased that it's going well and that we can do both live and uploaded videos. We think over time that marketers will follow where people are spending their time. And if the ads can be well-targeted, we think we'll be able to see engagement, and we already see that. When ads are really well targeted and taking full advantage of the kind of targeting we offer, so you're showing people something they want to see, we see engagement that we think is really critical.
It's also worth noting that the metrics that really matter at the end are driving sales. And so any of the engagement with ad metrics, whether it's remembering an ad going back to – people have been measuring that for a long time too, how long a video ad is viewed, are only proxy metrics. What matters is the impact on sales. And so we think the better we can do at getting the measurement to what actually matters, which is the end behavior marketers are trying to drive, the more people will shift their focus to business metrics, the better it will be for the returns they get and ultimately our business.

Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC
Thanks. I have three philosophical questions on video for you guys. Anyone can grab them. The first is, it was interesting to see the NFL games go from Twitter to Amazon. I wonder. Do the NFL games fit with your video strategy, and why or why not? That's one.
Two is, I know the model is revenue share, but a lot of the more traditional companies would like a license fee or the ability to sell their own inventory on your platform. Is that something you'd consider?
And last but not least, the question about monetization, why is mid-roll optimal to pre-roll, and can you share anything about the testing of that concept?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I can talk about sports. So in terms of experimenting with different content, I think we'll try a number of different things here. In terms of working with folks to produce all kinds of content, sports is probably something that we'll want to try at some point. But again, like Dave said before, the goal is going to be creating some anchor content initially that helps people learn that going to the video tab that that's a great destination where they can explore and come to Facebook with the intent to watch the videos that they want.
And then the long-term goal is actually not to be paying for specific content like that, but doing a revenue share model once the whole economy around video on Facebook is built up. But we're working on that, and I think we'll probably look at different pieces of content like this around the world, but at this point don't feel like any specific one of them is a must-have for us.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
And I think Mark touched on the question of business model here, and our focus really is on revenue share. We'll be investing to kick-start the ecosystem with content, so derisking it for some of our content partners to start off with, but the focus is really to build a rev-share model over time that's sustainable. That's the focus as opposed to other models.
In terms of why mid-roll is preferable to pre-roll, Facebook is well suited for shorter-form content where we're ranking things to be longer-form as well. So we're ranking longer-form video, but that's still relatively short video views. And for that reason, we think mid-roll is a better user experience.

Thanks very much, one for Sheryl. Sheryl, you talked a lot about the targeting advantage of Facebook, and you have a number of data signals and sources informing that. I'm wondering if you could talk about the relative importance of collecting signals on the platform versus off the platform, for instance, the behavior of Facebook users interacting with third-party websites. Is this the depth of your off-platform collection? Is this a significant competitive advantage for you? Thank you very much.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
We think that targeting end measurement are significant competitive advantages for us. We're very focused on the privacy of what people do, wherever they do it, and using the information we have in a very responsible way. We believe that because people are sharing interests, because people are themselves their real identity on the Facebook platform, we have a significant advantage just in basic targeting itself. Just age and gender, we're 38% more accurate than broad-based targeting according to Nielsen in the U.S., and that's just age and gender. And then if you think about some of the key studies I shared, targeting people who purchase a certain item, targeting people who are interested in a certain item, we think that's very substantial.
We also think that there's a real competitive advantage in focusing on business results, as we have. We're really working on shifting people to understanding what their real objectives are so that they can focus on driving businesses. At the end of the day, when you show an ad, you want to move a product off a lot, off a shelf, into a shopping cart, whether it's online or offline, and that's where our focus is and will continue to be.

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Deborah. And thanks, everyone, for joining today. This was another good quarter and a good end to 2016. Our community continues to grow, and now with nearly 1.9 billion people using Facebook every month and more than 1.2 billion people using it every day. We've seen continued growth and engagements on our platform, and our ads business is doing well, too. Total revenue grew by 51% year-over-year to $8.8 billion, and advertising revenue was up 53% to $8.6 billion.
Facebook stands for connecting people and creating a global community. And, in 2016, more people than ever made their voices heard. We saw billions of conversations about everything from important elections to the Olympics to breaking news stories around the world. And more people are taking advantage of new tools to connect and share on our family of apps, especially with video.
2016 was also a year that reinforced the importance of connecting the world. Today is the five-year anniversary of the day we filed to go public. In our letter to potential shareholders, I wrote that there is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future. I believe that now more than ever. And as the largest global community, I see our responsibility as very important, and we will continue to focus on doing everything we can to bring the world closer together.
I want to give you an update on our progress over our 3, 5 and 10-year time horizons, with a particular focus on what we're going to be doing over the next three years. I've said before that I see video as a megatrend on the same order as mobile. That's why we're going to keep putting video first across our family of apps and making it easier for people to capture and share video in new ways.
To make it easier to find and watch videos, we've added a tab at the bottom of the Facebook app with top videos and recommendations. We've already rolled the tab out to everyone in the U.S., and we're planning to bring it to more countries soon.
We're also improving live video as more people use it. New Year's Eve was our biggest live moment ever, with more people going live than at any other time since we launched the product. We're experimenting with Live 360 video, audio-only live for people with slower connections, and live face masks and more camera effects, and we'll have more updates soon.
Finally, we're looking for ways to grow the ecosystem of video content on Facebook. We want people to think of Facebook as a place for interesting and relevant video content from professional creators as well as their friends. Last year we started to invest in more original video content to help seed the ecosystem, and we're planning to do more in 2017.
We're also focused on building a more informed community. We see Facebook as a community, and ourselves, our role, as supporting that community. We don't write the news that you read, but we want to be a place where people can access information and have meaningful conversations, and this is a responsibility that we take very seriously.
In the past, we've taken steps to reduce spam and clickbait, and now we're approaching misinformation and hoaxes the same way. In Q4, we started working with third-party fact-checkers in the U.S. to flag disputed stories and make them less likely to appear in News Feed. We've made it easier to report and identify misinformation and we're working to build stronger ties between Facebook and the news industry.
Our primary goal here is to do the right thing for our community. If we can help people stay informed and make Facebook a better place to understand what's going on in the world, then we think that's going to make our community stronger and a more positive force for good in the world. So that's the three-year update.
Over the next five years, we're going to keep building ecosystems around our apps that a lot of people are already using. Growth and engagement on Instagram have been strong. We announced in December that Instagram now has over 600 million monthly actives and recently passed 400 million daily actives. Instagram Stories reached 150 million daily actives just five months after the launch, and we've added new features like Boomerang and Live into Stories and I'm excited to see that continue to grow.
Our messaging services are making good progress as well. In Q4, Messenger launched a new camera, group video chat for up to 50 people, and games. 400 million people now use voice and video chat on Messenger every month.
WhatsApp is growing quickly, too. We recently reached 1.2 billion monthly actives and more than 50 billion messages are sent through WhatsApp every day. In the last quarter, we also added the ability to make video calls in the app.
Over the next 10 years, we're going to continue to invest in these platforms and technologies that is going to give more people a voice and make sharing even more immersive. Through our efforts with Internet.org, we have now connected more than 50 million people to the Internet. And, in November, our Connectivity Lab set a world record by transmitting 20 gigabits per second over 13 kilometers using the same amount of power that it takes to light a single light bulb. Ultimately, this technology is going to make it into the solar-powered planes that we're building to beam Internet to parts of the world that aren't connected.
On artificial intelligence, we developed a new technique called style transfer that uses AI to study a painting and then can take your photos and videos and draw them in that style in real time on your phone. And if you post on Facebook looking for a place to eat or suggestions for where to go, we can now use AI to understand the text of your post and understand what you're asking and surface (07:20) recommendations from the comments.
We're still early in our 10-year plans for virtual reality, but we've made some good progress. In December, we shipped our Touch controllers, and the community response has been very positive. Samsung announced that they've now shipped more than 5 million Gear VRs. And we're bringing more social experiences to VR with apps like Oculus Rooms for Gear VR. We're going to keep making big investments in VR content, and I'm excited about what's coming in 2017, from new games to more immersive educational experiences.
As I said in our call last quarter, we're going to continue to invest and hire aggressively to help improve our products, but also to build the infrastructure that will help us grow in the future. A few weeks ago, I visited our newest data center in Fort Worth, Texas. It's going to be the biggest data center we've built, powered by 100% renewable energy, and it's a great example of the investments that we're making to help us serve our community even better.
So we've made some good progress, but we have a lot more to do to help bring the world together. I want to thank our community, our teams, our partners, and all of you for being a part of this journey with us.
Now here's Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Mark, and hi everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter capping off a great 2016. Q4 ad revenue grew 53%. Mobile ad revenue reached $7.2 billion, up 61% year-over-year, and was approximately 84% of total ad revenue. Our growth this quarter was broad-based across all regions, marketer segments, and verticals.
We're really excited to announce today that 65 million businesses are using our free Pages product and 5 million are using Instagram Business profiles. More and more of these businesses are becoming advertisers with over 4 million advertising on Facebook and over 500,000 on Instagram. As a result, our revenue base is becoming more diverse. In Q4, our top 100 advertisers represented less than a quarter of our ad revenue, which is a decline from Q4 last year.
We continue to focus on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. In Q4, we saw consumers use mobile for more of their holiday shopping. comScore found that mobile drove over $1 billion in total Cyber Monday sales for the first time ever. Marketers are increasingly seeing mobile as the opportunity it is. In 2016, we saw more marketers prioritizing mobile and especially mobile video.
People consume video differently on mobile, so the best marketers are optimizing their creative. For example, Hershey's used Facebook Live and Video ads for the launch of their Cookie Layer Crunch. They optimized their video ads to grab attention in the first few seconds and used captions for people who were viewing without sound. Nielsen Brand Effect measured an 11 point lift in brand awareness and a 20 point lift in ad recall.
We are helping more businesses connect with more people on mobile, both on Facebook and off. Last month, we announced that advertisers can reach over 1 billion people a month on the Audience Network.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. It's clear that businesses of all sizes are using our platforms to reach customers. Two weeks ago, I visited Holzconnection, a family-run furniture maker in Berlin. When competition increased several years ago, the owner worried that he might have to close stores. His son joined the family business and convinced his father to market on Facebook. Holzconnection didn't change anything about their traditional craft, just the way they reached customers. Since then, they've opened five new locations both domestic and internationally. We want to help more small businesses grow, so we've invited companies including Holzconnection to participate in Small Business Councils around the world.
We continue to invest in making our free and paid products easier to use, expanding our online tutorials and offering creative tools to businesses of all sizes. For example, the owners of Distinctive Gardens, a gardening center in Illinois, watched one of our online tutorials and then used their mobile phone to shoot a holiday-themed video. They sold out their holiday inventory.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Our goal is to drive value for our clients. As we grow the diversity of businesses on our platform, we've invested in building ad products that meet a broad set of objectives, from building brands to moving products off shelves online and in-stores.
To make our ad products as relevant and effective as possible, we're increasingly tailoring them by vertical. In 2016, we invested in Dynamic Ads, which allow advertisers to automatically promote products from their entire catalog. We expanded Dynamic Ads across Facebook, Instagram, and the Audience Network, and tailored them for verticals like travel and retail.
Dynamic Ads for travel enable businesses to show ads based on dates and destinations people are interested in, while Dynamic Ads for retail show people the products available at nearby locations in real-time. Last month, we introduced Dynamic Ads for broad audiences to help businesses reach new customers based on their interests on Facebook and online behavior. We're going to continue to work on building effective ad products and proving the value they drive.
We know that measurement is important to building advertiser trust. Last year, we discovered several metrics issues. And while no billable metrics were affected, we took action to fix the errors and reviewed all of our metrics. We also expanded our partnerships with third parties, given the important role they play in verification. We're going to continue to invest in measurement, including third-party partnerships, in the upcoming year.
We believe our strong 2016 is because of the value we drove for businesses on our platforms. We're inspired by the entrepreneurs we work with, like the owners of Holzconnection and Distinctive Gardens, and we're grateful for the opportunity to help them reach customers, grow their businesses, and hire more people.
With only a small fraction of the businesses on Facebook and Instagram advertising, we know we have a lot of opportunity and hard work ahead. In 2017, we'll stay focused on helping businesses of all sizes reach customers around the world and grow.
Thanks. And now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. 2016 was another year of strong, profitable growth, and we continued to invest in building our business for the long term. Full year 2016 revenue was $27.6 billion and grew 54% or 56% on a constant currency basis, and we generated over $10 billion in GAAP net income.
Let's start with our community metrics. In December, 1.23 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 189 million or 18% compared to last year. 1.86 billion people used Facebook during the month of December, up 269 million or 17% compared to last year. In addition to our ongoing Internet.org and Android product efforts, we benefited from an increase in third-party promotional free data plans in Asia and rest of the world.
Mobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.15 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in December, up 212 million or 23% compared to last year. Given that the vast majority of monthly and daily usage now occurs on mobile devices, my comments will focus on total MAU and DAU beginning next quarter. And we do not plan to include mobile and mobile-only usage breakdowns in our supplemental investor materials after this quarter.
Turning now to the financials. My prepared remarks will focus on our GAAP results unless otherwise noted. As I have noted before, we focus on GAAP results because stock-based compensation plays an important role in how employees are compensated in our business and industry more broadly, and we view it as a real expense. Q4 total revenue was $8.8 billion, up 51%. Q4 ad revenue was $8.6 billion, up 53% or 54% on a constant currency basis.
Mobile ad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 61%, and represented approximately 84% of total ad revenue. Desktop ad revenue grew 22%, despite a decline in desktop usage, helped by our efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers on advertisements served on personal computers.
The same supply and demand factors we have discussed in the past continue to drive our mobile ads revenue. On the demand side, we continued to improve our targeting, measurement and ad formats to drive strong results for marketers. As Sheryl mentioned, these efforts are working for an increasingly broad set of advertisers.
On the supply side, growth in users, time spent, and ad load also contributed to our strong results. In Q4, the average price per ad increased 3% and the total number of ad impressions served increased 49%, driven primarily by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram. Payments and other fees revenue was $180 million, down 12%. Q4 total expenses were $4.2 billion, up 29%. We ended the year with approximately 17,000 employees, up 34% compared to last year and an increase from the 31% growth rate last quarter.
Q4 operating income was $4.6 billion, representing a 52% margin. Our tax rate was 21%. Note that our tax rate reflects our early adoption of a new accounting standard ASU 2016-9. Under this standard, the tax benefit related to the difference between the vesting price and the grant price of RSUs is now reflected in our income tax provision, whereas previously it was reflected as an adjustment to equity. This is purely an accounting convention change and does not change the cash taxes we pay. Excluding the impact of this new standard, our Q4 GAAP tax rate would have been approximately 26% and in line with the guidance we provided on the Q3 call.
Net income was $3.6 billion or $1.21 per share. Full year 2016 capital expenditures were approximately $4.5 billion, up 78%, as we continue to invest to support the rapid growth of the business around the world.
Over the course of 2016, we expanded four of our existing data centers and began construction of four new data centers. In 2016, we generated over $11.6 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with $29.4 billion in cash and investments.
Also note that the new accounting standard changed how we present operating cash flow and the free cash flow calculation. In the past, we treated the excess tax benefit as a financing cash flow item and thus was not included in either cash flow metric. Adoption of this standard also resulted in a retrospective adjustment to certain 2016 quarterly financial line items. For more detail on these adjustments, please refer to the supplemental earnings slides available on our investor website.
Turning now to the outlook. First, on revenue, the outlook is unchanged. Consistent with my comments on the Q3 call, we continue to expect that our ad revenue growth rate will come down meaningfully in 2017. The factors driving this expectation remain the same. We also expect that our full year 2017 payments and other fees revenue will decline compared to full year 2016.
Second, on expenses. Consistent with what I said last quarter, we expect that 2017 will be an aggressive investment year. We saw hiring growth accelerate in Q4, and we plan to accelerate hiring further in 2017 from the 34% growth rate. In addition to head count, we expect to increase investments in R&D, content, sales and marketing and other areas as we execute on our near, medium and long-term priorities.
We expect that full year 2017 total GAAP expenses will grow 40% to 50% compared to the full year 2016. We anticipate that full year 2017 share-based compensation expenses will be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion, approximately $1.3 billion of which is related to acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp.
We also expect full year 2017 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. Accordingly, on a non-GAAP basis, we would expect total expenses to grow approximately 47% to 57% compared to the full year 2016.
We anticipate our expense growth rates will increase over the course of the year. We expect our full year 2017 capital expenditures will be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, as we fund the expansion of data center capacity and office facilities to support the continued rapid growth of our business.
Turning now to tax. At current stock prices, we expect that our full year 2017 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates will be one to two percentage points lower than our respective 2016 tax rates. Let me note two additional factors with the new standard. First, our tax rate will vary based on stock price. And secondly, we anticipate the tax rate will start to lower in Q1 and then trend up throughout the year.
Before wrapping up, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter, our board of directors authorized a $6 billion stock repurchase program beginning in 2017 with no fixed expiration date. Our main priority is to invest aggressively to grow the business while maintaining a strong cash position. At this time, the company's strong balance sheet and financial performance puts us in a position to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock from time to time to help offset the dilution incurred through equity issuance.
To conclude, 2016 was a strong year for Facebook in terms of community growth, engagement, product innovation and the growth of our advertising business. We believe we have significant opportunities ahead of us as we invest in our mission to make the world more open and connected.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my question. Mark, it's been a couple of quarters that you've talked about video first. Can you just talk about the strategic importance of longer-form content? And then also how do you think about that in terms of distribution platforms both on the Facebook mobile app and then through other distribution formats as well? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
We're focusing more on shorter-form content to start. So the thesis that we have now is that there were different parts of short-term content. There is the type of content that people will produce socially for friends. There's promotional content that businesses and celebrities and folks will produce. But there's also a whole class of premium content that the creators need to get paid a good amount in order to support the creation of that content, and we need to be able to support that with a business model, which we're working on through ads to fund that. So the biggest change that I think that we're going to see on the consumption in News Feed and in the tab over the next year or two is going to be much more video inventory and content coming in as we work through and make that business model start to really click for a lot of folks.
Over the longer term, I think as that works, people will experiment with longer forms of video as well and all kinds of different things. But that, I think, is the primary focus for the foreseeable future.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. And Doug, I think you asked about platforms. I mean we've always been focused on a variety of – getting our services on a variety of platforms, but main focus is obviously on mobile.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one Mark is on Instagram, the 400 million daily active users. Curious to be – hear (24:39) how you think about the core use of Instagram now and how it differs from core Facebook. And how do you think about that evolving over time and the monetization of Instagram evolving over time? And then the second one, just to go back to Doug's question on the content, I know Dave, you mentioned content spend as being part of the investment. Should we think about the content investment as being more driven on rev share or do you see yourselves going out and writing and doing licensing deals? Thanks so much.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
I can start on that latter question. Our goal really is to kick-start an ecosystem of partner content in the video tab, for example, and our model is really oriented towards revenue share with creators. We are funding some feed content to get the ecosystem going, but the focus is on rev share. And then I think your question was on how the core use case between Facebook and Instagram differs.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah, I can take that one. There are a number of differences. I think a lot of this comes down to the graphs in the community that you have in the different places. Instagram is a follow model, right, so it's – they're not all bidirectional friendships. A larger portion of the content is public content. More of the content is visual, right. Facebook has a mix of text and news and links and visual content like photos and videos. And Instagram creates a pure experience that's focused on photos and videos. So all those good and subtle decisions that Kevin has made over the years add up to creating a different kind of community that what we're finding and that's great, is that it's really complementary to what people are doing on Facebook.
And some of what we found is that as we encourage people to use both Facebook and Instagram, engagement on both can increase. So that is great. And that I think speaks to how you can build these different kinds of communities with different connections in a way that really is creating new value in people's lives.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, sticking on the same theme as what Doug and Brian just talked about. Sheryl, for you; would love to get a sense of how you think about some of the opportunities and challenges sitting ahead of the business now on monetizing all of the video that's being consumed on Facebook. And then maybe, Dave, for you. When we think about the P&L impacts of both monetizing video and investing in video, is there anything we should be thinking about or you want to call out in terms of gross versus net on either the revenue side or the revenue share side that could be leading to mix shift to incremental revenue growth but possibly lower margin revenue coming into the business? Thanks so much.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On the video ad opportunity, we're seeing consumer video exploding on our platform, as Mark has talked about, and that really creates the opportunity for video ads in the feed. And a lot of this happens within the current News Feed product. People post videos. People consume News Feed stories. Those stories include video stories from consumers, and then we have an opportunity to serve ads.
As consumer video has grown in News Feed, it's given us that opportunity for video ads because the format of the ads fits the format of what consumers are doing. And we're seeing a lot of great examples of people using ads in the feed across Instagram and News Feed.
In terms of monetizing some of our newer attempts at products in News Feed such as Ad Break, those are really in early experimental stages, and for now, we're really focused primarily on our core business, our core ad products, of which video is one.
One of the things that's really important in this is helping marketers understand that they need to optimize those video ads. An ad that works really well 30 seconds in other platforms and more traditional platforms can work on ours, but the ones that are optimized and use our targeting really perform better. And we're working hard with advertisers to help them see that.
So to share one example, Motorola working with Ogilvy and Moto Mento (28:55) launched the Moto Z phone, and they did awareness boosting before they launched, targeting Android users and Verizon subscribers. And they optimized their video for the Facebook and Instagram mobile feeds. And then after they launched, they did purchasing ads and re-targeted people who had viewed those initial ads.
That's just a great example of someone using video ads, optimizing a format, but also using the pretty unique targeting we can offer to drive sales. They measured that they had over a 3.5% lift in sales driven by the Facebook and Instagram video ads. And so we're pretty excited about the opportunity we have in our current business, and we're going to work client by client to get the video format of those ads right, get the targeting to be as good and as deep as it can be and make sure we're measuring all the way through to sales.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
And Eric, you were asking about content and where that's going to get picked up in the P&L. There's no real simple answer in that. I would say in general where we're going to be, rev sharing with creators, that's going to be picked up in cost of revenue. So that's probably the simplest answer.
But as we do arrangements to get the ecosystem going, some of that could get picked up in sales and marketing, and then we have content as well that's getting picked up in R&D for the efforts we're making with Oculus. So you're seeing some of those get spread across several different lines in the P&L, so it's not going to be a clean one spot where you're going to find it.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. With the strategic shift to video, how do you view the state of the digital/mobile video measurement? Any callout on improvements being done industry wide and within Facebook? And then just on video search, could you just comment on improvements in video search capabilities for users? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sheryl, do you want to take the question on video measurement and...
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
...how that's evolving?
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. So new platforms demand new measurement, and so people are measuring all kinds of different things from viewability to how many people see the ad to how long they run the ad. We're focused on all of these metrics and working hard with third parties and with our advertiser to get those metrics right.
We really believe that at the end of the day what matters the most is all the way through to sales. What matters the most is the A/B test that these people saw ads on Facebook and Instagram, these people didn't, and here's the sales lift. And all of the other metrics, although important and we're working hard, are proxy metrics, and those metrics are going through a platform shift that we need to work on.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
And then, Mark.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
And for video search – search is a big priority and a thing that we're working on across all of the different verticals, not just video but also all the posts on Facebook, all of the content that people are selling in Marketplace, the groups that people are joining and sharing and all the news content. And it's an area that we've been working on for a while. It's growing steadily and doing well, and we hope to have more updates on that soon.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions. I think the first one might be directed at Sheryl. Your reported pricing metric, I realize there's typically been noise in that. I think it's up 3% year-on-year. First of all, is that sort of representative for general pricing changes in the Marketplace? And do you think that there's still room for upside in pricing? And if so, where are some of the key areas where you see that coming from?
And then another question on video. As you've begun to push more video content to users within the Facebook app itself, are you witnessing any meaningful changes in engagement, time spent with a typical Facebook app user? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Mark, it's Dave. I can take those on the metrics. From the price-volume perspective, yeah, the price per ad increased modestly 3%. There's lots of different underlying metrics, but the overall kind of reported metric is really – continues to be driven by the mix shift away from right-hand column ads, which are lower price and lower value. And then, obviously impression growth is driven by the users' time spent in ad load.
In terms of the opportunities for price, it's really just continuing to focus on making our ads better targeted, more relevant, improving all the different ways in which we can drive better outcomes for our advertisers and sort of meeting them with the results that they care about and delivering those results. We think there's – continue to be great opportunities to do that, and how the supply-demand dynamics play out will kind of impact the overall direction of price. And it's going to depend obviously also on regional mixes too, because some regions have obviously lower prices.
I think the other question was on video. Video is one of the big drivers of engagement growth on Facebook. It's also helpful on Instagram where we're also seeing the benefit of ranking changes. So we continue to see good engagement and time spent growth across the Facebook family and on just Facebook, and video is a part of that story. So it's an important part of that story.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. A couple things. First, we had a lot of political activity obviously in Q4. Did that contribute anything abnormally to revenues or users? Second question, and I know you'll be getting a lot of this over the next two or three months, but just any difference on trends – Millennials on the platform versus other cohorts or groups? Just thinking about how those are trending versus the other groups. And then finally, I think we've seen some ads on Messenger being tested in certain regions of the world. Any commentary on that would be helpful. Thank you.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. I'll take a few of those. So on elections, we run a very large and diversified business. So there are these events that are obviously big like the U.S. elections, the World Cup, Super Bowl, but there are enough of these all around the world that no one event is that big for our business. Even last quarter, political spending even within the U.S. alone was not a top-10 vertical for us.
When you think about ads in Messenger, we right now are really focused on consumer growth and engagement because we know that over time that creates the monetization opportunity. We're seeing a lot of organic connections between businesses and consumers. We're now per month at a billion messages sent between people and businesses, and we think that's very promising for our ability for people to use this platform to make those connections that will ultimately drive business opportunities.
We're in the very early stages, some of those ads you're seeing of exploring how to build more of these connections. But right now, we're going to remain focused on user experience and the experimentation we're doing.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. And Justin, just adding to the question on elections, I'd also point out that our reported daily active and monthly active numbers reflect usage in December. So even for the U.S. that doesn't really pick up the election period just because of the way that we tabulate those results.
On Millennials, we were really pleased – this was a fantastic quarter for overall growth of the Facebook community, our strongest absolute MAU and DAU additions year-over-year since being a public company, so really pleased with that. So within that context, we're not breaking out specific cohorts, but we remain a great place for advertisers to reach Millennials. And Instagram is obviously another great place to reach Millennials, and we continue to build our products to serve a wide variety of audiences, including Millennials as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
David, I think you just talked about these pretty material increases in MAUs. Could I ask two questions? The Asia area MAU growth in particular – I think it was something like 44 million sequentially, that's the biggest that I think you've ever had. So could you just talk about was there some particular markets in particular region there that added to it? And then talking Asia, could you just comment, Mark, on China and how you think about it at long-term as a market opportunity and your level of optimism that Facebook can have a material presence in that market in 5 to 10 years? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So, Mark, Asia benefits probably more than any other region around the sort of three factors that I called out in my prepared remarks. And those are Internet.org efforts, Android product improvements that we've continued to make a big area like Android – Facebook Lite platform on Android has been a great grower for us. But then particularly in the fourth quarter, one of the callouts that we've seen, an increase in third-party promotional free data plans in places like India. So that clearly is having an impact in APAC and India was our strongest growth market. So that would be something that I would say is a little bit more unique this past quarter.

Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
My (39:08) China question.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. Sorry. Mark's going to take China second (39:12).
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So as I've said a number of times before, our mission is to connect everyone in the world, and it's hard to do that over the long term if we don't find a way to serve more than a billion people who live in China. So that's certainly a thing that we're going to look out at over the long term. In the specific time horizon that you mentioned, I think it's really hard to predict how this will play out or what we will end up doing. But one of the big things that we need to think about here is, of course, we're only going to do this in a way that we're comfortable with over the long term. So this is something that we're going to continue engaging in and thinking about, how to move forward on, and long-term it's very important. But no news at all in the near-term.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you for taking the questions. I had two. I was just wondering, Mark, you mentioned similar to how you referenced Facebook and Instagram being complementary, how do you think about WhatsApp and Messenger? And I'm wondering if there's different paths to monetization over time for each of these?
And then my second question, I guess, might be for any of you. Just you, Dave, have mentioned expectations for slower growth in ad load on core Facebook in the second half of this year. How should we think about the potential for ad load growth on Instagram? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I'll take Messenger and WhatsApp and you can take ad load. So yes is the basic answer that Messenger and WhatsApp serve somewhat different utilities for people. WhatsApp really takes the place of SMS in a lot of the markets where it operates. The graph is based on phone numbers. You're as likely to text your barber or someone that you're going to transact with, who you would have a phone number with, as you would be a friend. Whereas on Facebook Messenger, the graph is your friends, and you're more likely to, say, wish an acquaintance happy birthday on Facebook Messenger than on WhatsApp or you might not have their phone number in the first place.
So you can think about some overlap in the core use case, you might message your close friends and family on either. But what we found in general is that if you look at some of the markets that are strongest for both of them, they can each grow in those markets, and as messaging has become more affordable and more reliable for people, the volumes of messaging have just gone through the roof in terms of what people want to do.
My understanding from looking at a bunch of analytics is that the peak of global SMS reached somewhere in the low 20 billion messages per day, and we already have many times more than that. Three times or more, more than that across WhatsApp and Messenger. And, of course, there are other messaging products in the world besides these as well. So we're pretty confident that this is going to keep on growing.
I do think to your point that the monetization paths are going to be somewhat different, reflecting the differences in product philosophy. So Messenger is much more focused on being an expressive and rich environment that has lots of different types of content. Kind of more like Facebook to the Instagram example that we used before, whereas WhatsApp I think is a much more utilitarian experience with a much more stark UI where there's just not as much emphasis on having a lot of different ways to engage.
So we did the experiment that you asked about before around ads and Messenger and different ways that businesses can interact and there's a lot of flexibility around how we can explore there, which is why I think you'll see more of that on the Messenger side than on the WhatsApp side in the near term. But giving businesses the opportunity to connect in WhatsApp and reach the people that they want and eventually have increasingly, hopefully, transactional interactions I think will be a really useful thing on that platform as well.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Heather, it's Dave. Just on Instagram versus Facebook and ad load, clearly the biggest driver of our business is core Facebook just in terms of sheer size and even sheer contribution to growth. Instagram is growing quicker on a percentage basis, but it's much smaller. The ad load opportunities are higher on Instagram because Instagram is at a lower ad load than Facebook, so there is an opportunity for us to continue to grow ad load on Instagram probably beyond – in a longer timeframe than there is on Facebook because of that disparity in terms of where they are today. But given the scale of Facebook and the importance of driving overall revenue, that's why I continue to express what our expectations are for advertising growth in 2017 and the reduction in the growth rate that we expect, given the potential to grow ad load on Facebook that we expect to come down in 2017.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much. Two for Sheryl, if I could. First of all, Sheryl, when it comes to measurement, I'm curious if you could comment on what appear to be the really successful efforts you've had in linking on Facebook ad exposure to both offline and online sales of your customers. And, I guess, when we think across maybe your 1,000 largest clients, any chance you could give us a sense of what percentage are utilizing this level of kind of advanced measurement in terms of measuring actual sales lift and share gains?
And then, secondly, just wondering if there's any color around the pretty recent rollout of buy buttons on Instagram? Thank you very much.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Yeah. So when you think on measurement, your question gets to the heart of the matter, which is, there's a lot of conversations on what we measure. And when you see platform shifts, as you are in the ad market, from more traditional forms of media to display, to now mobile, we're seeing those metrics change, and there's obviously a lot of conversation and a lot of concern out there about what we're measuring. We think the answer to all of this is to remember that what really matters is going all the way through from the ad itself to the sale, whether that sale is online or offline. And we are working hard to work on the data in a privacy protected way to be able to do that. And we're making progress across verticals, across our large customers.
I don't have the percentage of exactly how many customers are working on this type of measurement with us. It's certainly growing. It's certainly something we're working on vertical-by-vertical. But it has really important impacts, not just in their ability to serve the right ads to the right person at the right time, but also their ability to optimize their ads for our format. That once they understand what's really moving their product off shelves, online and off, that's where we get to the real work we need to do to optimize the ad and really work on the targeting. And so I remain very optimistic. We have a lot of hard work to do to get to all of our ad campaigns having that kind of measurement. That's going to take a long time. But the more we can do it, even in studies with each client, the better our ads get.
Operator
Your next question...
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Oh, buy button. Yeah, sorry. Just to address the buy button. The core of our business is really connecting people with what they care about. And so we're looking at getting the right message the right time. We've worked hard on products ads that get to products. So you've seen us work on dynamic ads, carousel ads, estimated store visits. Things that help our ad business sell products. You are seeing us take other steps like a buy button, like the Marketplace launch, which are really aimed at improving some of the experiences we think people are trying to have and already having in organic ways on Facebook. But the core of our focus is still very much focused on ads and how we can do ads at the product level.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Sena from Evercore ISI.
Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI
Thanks. Just on the OpEx for 2017, you mentioned R&D, content, sales, marketing. As we think about R&D and also the talent shortages that are in data science and engineering, not to mention the potentially getting worse around immigration, et cetera, how should we think about that potentially factoring in as we look out through 2017 and maybe a little bit further out? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, Ken. I mean, we obviously are focused on hiring top engineering talent. It's key to our 2017 goals and executing on our three, five, and 10-year roadmap, the one that Mark outlined. One thing that we're optimistic about is our ability to hire technical talent outside of the Bay Area as well as in the Bay Area. And that's because we've built up engineering locations in key areas like Seattle, London, New York, Boston, Tel Aviv. So we've got other markets in which we can recruit and grow engineering and other technical team. And that's really different from where we were a couple years ago. So that's an important part of the infrastructure that we've put in place in the last two years that we're pleased with.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies.
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies & Company, Inc.
Thanks. Mark, on AI maybe. You mentioned improved recommendations and we've interacted with chatbots on Messenger. Maybe curious overall how you see artificial intelligence and machine learning processes impacting your business over time?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Well, I think AI is going to be great for the experience that people have in our community. So there are a few types of systems here that we're working on around understanding content. One is around visual content and the other is about language. So, for visual content, we want to be able to look at a photo and understand what's in it, right, and whether that's something that you're going to be interested in, right? And similarly, we want to be able look at a video and watch it and understand whether that's something that you're going to be interested in.
And you can imagine that today, we consider putting things in your News Feed that you're connected to in some way, right, that are from a friend or a page that you're following or that one of your friends likes. But there's no reason that we shouldn't be able to match you up with any of the millions of pieces of content that you might be interested in that gets shared on Facebook every day, except for the fact that we don't have the AI technology to know what those are about and if they match your interest today. So, a combination of being able to understand the text that people message, read the articles that people would want to look at, watch the videos, look at the photos, are going to be great, too.
Another area where I'm really excited about this is our ability to keep the community safe, right? So there's an increasing focus on objectionable content, right, and a lot of unfortunate things, right, that people share on Facebook. And it's a minority of the content, but I'm really focused on making sure that our company gets faster at taking the bad stuff down. And we can do better with people, but ultimately the best thing that we can do is build AI systems that can watch a video and understand that it's going to be problematic and violate the policies of our community and that people aren't going to want to see it and then just not show it to people before bad experiences happen and things like violence gets spread through – violent content gets spread through the network.
So I think it's both going to be – AI is both going to be great on showing people content that's really good and helping us enforce the community standards that we have to make sure that everyone has a good and fair experience.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt from Stifel.
Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thanks. I have two questions for Mark. Wondering, Mark, if you could talk a bit more about the new video tab, just early engagement trends, user feedback, and really just how the product works in terms of categorization of content, user preference targeting, and maybe how the content flows into the tab versus being in the News Feed and, to the extent, that there's duplication there.
And then separately, VR and AR continues to be in the 10-year vision for the business. Mark, I was wondering if you could provide some detail on what you think the friction points are that are keeping that from being on a more accelerated commercialization path. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So I'll take video first and then I can talk about VR as well. So, for the video tab, the goal that we have for the product experience is to make it so that when people want to watch videos or they want to keep up to date on what's going on with their favorite show or what's going on with the public figure that they want to follow, that they can come to Facebook and go to a place knowing that that's going to show them all the content that they're interested in.
So that's a pretty different intent than how people come to Facebook today. Today, for the most part, people pull Facebook out when they have a few minutes, when they want to catch up and see what's going on in the world with their friends and in the news and everything that's going on. That's very different from saying, hey, I want to watch video content now. And that's what I think we're going to unlock with this tab.
So, all of the content that is on Facebook is eligible to go in the tab. I mean, we're showing video content, not all the rest of it, but there isn't a concrete difference between what can be a News Feed and what can be here. It's just that the experience is designed to deliver on that promise of, you want to watch videos, you want to keep up with the content that you watch episodically week-over-week, this is going to the place where you go to do that.
I do think that it's going to get a lot stronger once the business model really starts to click here, right? Because a lot of the best episodic content is professionally created, and those folks need to make a good amount of money in order to support their business model. So having mid-roll ads, we're committed to doing this in a way that's very good on the user experience, but that is going to enable the kind of content that I think is going to take us to the next level.
The early trends are good, but I think this is really going to be an area that is proportional to the amount of quality content that is in the system, and the business model is really going to be the thing that enables that.
All right. Sorry. I forgot about that for a second. All right. So VR and AR, what can accelerate that? I think that there are parts of this that are on a good trajectory and parts where we're a little behind where we would want to be.
I think Samsung shipping 5 million Gear VRs. I mean, that's their product, not ours, but we build technology that powers it. I think that's quite a good result, right, and one that we're very happy with, and just shows how strong of a company Samsung is at being able to build these products and sell them through into the world.
On the side of the products that we built, Rift and Touch were both a little delayed, so that was obviously somewhat of a disappointment. And if you want to accelerate development, obviously, we need to get our products in the market at a good pace. But in terms of the content development, I actually think that that's coming at a reasonable clip.
Early on, there is this issue, which is that if you're a AAA game developer, until there's a certain volume of units in the field, you're not going to be able to make enough money to fund your game development just based off of people buying your content. So that's why we're investing so much capital in content to feed the ecosystem and solve this chicken and egg problem if you need the content in order to create the ecosystem. But I don't think that there is really a strategy to pull this in from 10 years to five, I just think it's going to be a 10-year thing.
The analogy that I always use is the first smartphones came out in 2003, right, the BlackBerry and Palm Treo, and it took 10 years to get to 1 billion units. And, I mean, I don't know if there was something that folks could have done to make that happen fast, but I think that was pretty good. And, I mean, if we can be on a similar trajectory of anywhere near 10 years for VR and AR, then I would feel very good about that, and I feel like we're making the right bets now to plant the seeds for that. But I would ask for the patience of the investor community in doing that because we're going to invest a lot in this, and it's not going to return or be really profitable for us for quite a while.

Your last question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura Instinet.
Anthony DiClemente, CFA - Nomura Instinet
Thanks a lot for fitting me in. A couple for Mark. Mark, just on the theme of video, given the strong cash position that Facebook has, the cash on the balance sheet, the free cash flow generation of the company, are there any possible acquisitions out there that you think would or could supercharge your growth in the video space, in the original content space, given this evolution?
And maybe along those lines, what do you think about live sports in terms of the video use case? Is that working on Facebook? You've experimented with NBA games on Facebook outside the U.S., NBA D-League on Facebook, so just wanted to get your thoughts on how those have gone. Thanks a lot.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
So, Anthony, I can just take the first part of that at least, which is – look, our focus is on kick-starting the ecosystem here for the video tab that Mark talked about. We're looking at a wide range of content, and we're really working towards a revenue share model with creators. We're certainly going to be seeding content to get the ecosystem going, but that's not about doing big deals. So we're certainly looking at a variety of different types of content to look at.

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today.
We had another good quarter. Our community continues to grow around the world. We're pleased to see nearly 1.8 billion people now use Facebook every month and nearly 1.2 billion people use it every day. It's also great to see the continued growth and strength of engagement on our platform, and our ads growth is growing at a healthy rate as well. Total revenue grew by 56% year over year to $7 billion, and advertising revenue was up 59% to $6.8 billion.
I want to start by talking about our work around putting video first across our apps. People are creating and sharing more video, and we think it's pretty clear that video is only going to become more important. So that's why we're prioritizing putting video first across our family of apps and taking steps to make it even easier for people to express themselves in richer ways.
One way we're putting video first is through live video on Facebook. Since May, the number of people going live at any given moment has grown by four times. And people have gone live from all seven continents and also from outer space.
Another recent example is Instagram Stories, which we launched in August. Instagram Stories is a lightweight way for people to share moments of their day through photos and videos that appear in a slide show format and disappear after 24 hours. Stories now has more than 100 million daily actives. We also improved the Explore tab in Instagram to include more videos and stories, and it has 100 million daily actives now as well.
In addition to making it easy to share video, we also want to make it easier to capture video. In most social apps today, a text box is still the default way we share. Soon, we believe a camera will be the main way that we share. We're already testing this in our main Facebook app with a version that has a camera, directly just one swipe away from News Feed, with creative effects for your photos and videos. And in Messenger, we're testing new camera and video features. We'll be experimenting with even more visual messaging tools over the next few months as well.
So those are a few examples of some of the things that we're doing to put video first across our family of apps. Now, I'll give you an update on our progress over our 3, 5, and 10-year time horizon.
Over the next 3 years, we're focusing on making our core services more useful and engaging. The 2016 Summer Olympics were huge on Facebook, with more than 270 million people creating 1.5 billion interactions. Facebook helped bring the world together. And athletes, fans, and media went live throughout the games, including athletes who went live from the Olympic Village, and Michael Phelps, who even announced his retirement on our platform.
This election season has also driven a lot of conversation, including on Facebook, where we've made it easier for voters and candidates to communicate with each other. In the first nine months of this year, 109 million people on Facebook in the U.S. generated over 5.3 billion posts, comments, and likes and shares related to the election. During the primaries and in September, we also added a Register to Vote link at the top of our Facebook app that we estimate helped more than 2 million people register to vote, some who were registering for the first time. Facebook really is the new town hall, and we're proud of the role that we've played in enabling dialogue and increasing civic engagement. That's the 3-year update.
Over the next 5 years, we're going to keep building ecosystems around products that a lot of people already use every day. Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp each have large communities, but we have a lot more work to do on all of them. I think about our progress here in three phases. The first phase is building a great consumer experience and getting it to scale. The second phase is about enabling people to organically interact with businesses. And then the third phase is to give businesses tools to reach more people, and that's where we build our business.
Right now, Instagram has moved into that third phase. Instagram has more than 500 million monthly actives and more than 300 million daily actives. We're making good progress helping businesses and marketers use Instagram in new ways, and Sheryl will talk more about that in a few minutes.
Messenger is early in the second phase. We're helping businesses and consumers increasingly interact in richer ways. Today there are 33,000 bots live on Messenger. We also launched Messenger Lite, which is designed to make messaging fast and easy with a wide variety of Android phones and for people who are on slower networks as well.
A lot of businesses use WhatsApp already, but we're going to really start working on the second phase in the next year. Right now, we're testing new camera features and we're continuing to keep features fast and reliable on multiple devices and every network condition.
Finally, we're starting to build communities around completely new apps. This quarter, we launched Workplace to help make organizations more connected and productive. Workplace is a communications platform that uses features that people know, like News Feed, groups, and messages to help them collaborate and share at work the same way that they do everywhere else. Already, more than 1,000 organizations are using Workplace, including Starbucks, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Danone, and we're adding more all the time.
We're also getting new services to scale in the core app. In October, we also launched the Marketplace tab to help people discover, buy, and sell things with people in their community. While we just launched Marketplace, many millions of people have been buying and selling things in Facebook for-sale groups for a while, and we think this is going to be an important tool going forward.
Over the next 10 years, we're going to continue to invest in the platforms and technologies that will connect more people and more places and allow everyone in the world to have a voice. We focused our long-term innovation roadmap around three areas: connectivity initiatives that bring more people online; artificial intelligence; and virtual and augmented reality.
On connectivity, through our efforts with internet.org, we've connected 40 million people, based on our best estimate. And we're making good progress with our Express Wifi program, which empowers entrepreneurs to build a business by providing their community with access to the Internet.
On artificial intelligence, we're starting to see the impact that AI can have on enhancing people's experiences on Facebook and showing them more of what they care about. More than 40 teams at Facebook and more than 25% of our engineers are already using AI to power the products and services they build. We've made changes and improvements to our AI in order to filter out misleading clickbait stories from News Feed. And we're using AI to help find terrorist propaganda on Facebook. It's still early, but we think that AI will help improve the quality of what people see and can share on our platform.
We also took some important steps forward on virtual reality to help people experience the world in richer and more immersive ways. At Oculus Connect, we announced that touch controllers for Rift will ship in early December with 35 games and experiences exclusively built for touch. And since we believe the next phase of VR is great software experiences, we're investing another $250 million in virtual reality content on top of the money that we've already invested.
So this was a very busy third quarter, and 2016 is shaping up to be a year of important progress for Facebook. Our business is performing well. And while I'm happy about what we've accomplished, we're really just getting started. We want to continue to invest aggressively to accomplish our goals, which is why we're hiring, especially in engineering, which is going to be one of our top priorities going into 2017, and Dave will say more about this in his remarks.
Everything we do is about opening the world to everyone and helping more people to connect and share. So I want to thank our entire community, all of our teams, our partners, and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us.
Now, here's Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone.
We had a great third quarter. Q3 ad revenue grew 59%. Mobile ad revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 70% year-over-year, and was approximately 84% of total ad revenue. Our growth was broad-based across all regions, marketer segments, and verticals. In Q3, we announced that we have over 4 million active advertisers on Facebook and over 500,000 active advertisers on Instagram. The number of advertisers on both platforms continues to grow quickly, and we're pleased to see more and more of them using the full range of our ad products.
We continue to focus on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile, people have shifted to mobile, and we remain focused on helping businesses catch up. We know that marketing shifts take time. The first TV ads showed people standing in front of microphones reading their radio ads. Similarly, many of the first mobile video ads were TV ads dropped into mobile. Ads optimized for each platform often perform better, so marketers are increasingly tailoring their creative for mobile.
We're excited to see the world's largest advertisers realize that the small screen is big. In September, P&G Chief Brand Officer, Marc Pritchard, GM CEO, Mary Barra, and I addressed the Adweek audience together. Marc described how P&G is creating mobile video ads designed to grab attention in the first few seconds. He shared the example of Tide. In a typical TV ad, they start with a clean dress or shirt, show it getting stained, and then cleaned it with Tide. On mobile, they need to communicate the product's value more quickly, so they start by showing Tide cleaning a stained garment.
Mary shared GM's success with Facebook mobile video ads. In Q3, GM subsidiary, Holden, used carousel ads with video to maximize its sponsorship of Australia's premier rugby tournament. Holden created a video series about their support of the youth rugby. The ads generated an 8-point lift in brand favorability for the overall audience and a 15-point lift amongst their target audience of women over 35.
For many small businesses, the shift to mobile means leveraging video for the very first time. Rather than needing a camera crew and production budget, anyone with a smartphone can shoot a video and share it on Facebook. In the past month alone, over 3 million small businesses have posted a video on Facebook, including organic posts and ads.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. We continue to focus on our advertiser pipeline. In Q2, we announced that over 60 million businesses use our free Facebook Pages product each month. And we introduced the Instagram equivalent, Business Profiles, which are being used by 1.5 million businesses.
On past calls, I talked about product simplification as a driver of advertiser growth on Facebook. Now with the launch of Promoted Posts, we are seeing that on Instagram too. Like Boosted Posts on Facebook, Promoted Posts on Instagram are an easy way to start advertising, and we're pleased with the adoption.
Over 85% of business pages are active on mobile, so we're making it easier for advertisers to manage campaigns from their phones. In Q3, we added a feature that shows marketers a preview of a potential ad in News Feed, just as their customers would see it. They can then run the ad with just a few taps from their mobile device.
Making it easy to advertise from a mobile phone is especially important in emerging markets. For businesses operating in areas with weak network connections, we continue to build advertising tools into Facebook Lite, our low bandwidth app, and are making more of them available offline.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Our goal is to be the number one driver of growth for our clients. In Q3, we introduced tools to help businesses find people around the world who look like their current customers and target the ones most likely to convert. For example, SA Company, an outdoor gear and apparel business started by a young man out of his parents' home, used international Lookalike targeting to reach customers in 32 countries and increase sales by 37%.
We're focused on driving purchases online and in stores. In Q2, we launched Estimated Store Visits, which show advertisers how many people came to their store after seeing an ad. And this quarter, we made it possible for advertisers to optimize campaigns for in-store visits. We also expanded Dynamic Ads, a proven way to drive online sales for in-store retail objectives. Businesses can use Dynamic Ads for Retail to show people the products available at their closest location in real time and reach people likely to visit their stores.
To prove the value we're driving for our partners, we continue to invest in measurements. This quarter we announced new third-party partnerships with Nielsen DataLogix, Visual IQ, and MarketShare to help our clients measure how Facebook ads drive business results.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and remain focused on helping them make the shift to mobile. With only a small fraction of businesses on Facebook and Instagram advertising, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help our partners around the world use mobile to drive their businesses.
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and congratulate our global teams on the results of their continued focus and dedication.
Thanks, and now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone.
Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. Total revenue grew 56% and exceeded $7 billion for the first time. And we delivered $2.4 billion in GAAP net income, up 166%. We saw healthy growth and engagement in our community as well as broad-based strength in our mobile ads business.
Let's start with our community metrics. In September, 1.18 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 172 million or 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.79 billion people that used Facebook in the month of September. Mobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.09 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in September, up approximately 197 million or 22% compared to last year.
Turning now to the financials, my comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics, and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Q3 total revenue was approximately $7 billion, up 56%. Q3 ad revenue was $6.8 billion, up 59%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall growth this quarter, as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others. Asia-Pacific and North America were our fastest growing regions, with ad revenue growth rates of 64% and 62% respectively. Ad revenue grew at a rate of 50% or more in all regions in Q3. Mobile ad revenue was $5.7 billion, up 70% and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
On prior calls, we discussed the supply and demand factors that drive our mobile ads business. As Sheryl noted earlier, advertiser demand remained strong in Q3 across all geographies, verticals, and marketer segments. We also benefited from growth in users, time spent, and ad loads. It is worth noting that desktop ad revenue grew 18%, which is higher than growth rates in recent quarters, and was aided by our efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers on advertising served via web browsers.
Our price/volume trends were similar to those we reported last quarter. The average price per ad increased 6% in Q3, while total ad impressions increased 50%. The reported increase in price continues to be driven by the ongoing mix shift towards mobile, where we show only higher priced feed ads. Impression growth was primarily driven by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Payments and other fees revenue was $195 million, down 3%. Payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q3 total expenses were $3.9 billion, up 28%. This includes $839 million of share-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes as well as $195 million of amortization of intangible assets.
In Q3, we hired over 1,200 people and ended the quarter with approximately 15,700 employees, up 31% compared to last year. We remain committed to investing aggressively in hiring, including expanding our technical and recruiting teams globally.
Q3 operating income was $3.1 billion, representing a 45% margin. Our tax rate was 25%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion or $0.82 per share.
Q3 capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. Year to date through September, capital expenditures were $3.2 billion, up 76%, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. In addition to our new data center projects in Texas and Ireland, we recently broke ground on our seventh data center facility in New Mexico, which we anticipate will come online in late 2018.
We generated approximately $2.5 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with $26.1 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook for the remainder of 2016, first, some color on revenue. We continue to expect that revenue growth rates will decline in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015. We also continue to expect that our total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 will be lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year.
Turning now to the 2016 expense outlook, based on our year-to-date results and our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our expense guidance ranges. We now expect that full-year 2016 GAAP expense growth will be at the lower end of our prior range of 30% to 35%. We expect full-year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and that full-year 2016 share-based compensation expenses to be approximately $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude those share-based compensation and amortization expenses, will grow in the range of 40% to 45%, down from our prior range of 45% to 50%.
We anticipate full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $4.5 billion, as we invest aggressively to support the rapid growth of the business. We expect that our Q4 and full-year 2016 tax rates will be in line with the year-to-date tax rates.
I also wanted to provide some brief comments on 2017. First on revenue, as I mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect that ad load will play a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017. Over the past few years, we have averaged about 50% revenue growth in advertising. Ad load has been one of the three primary factors fueling that growth. With a much smaller contribution from this important factor going forward, we expect to see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully.
Secondly on expenses, though it is premature to provide specific expense guidance, as Mark mentioned, we anticipate 2017 will be an aggressive investment year. Adding top engineering talent remains one of our key investment priorities as we continue to execute on our 3, 5, and 10-year roadmap. We will continue to invest in our ability to recruit top technology talent, both in the Bay Area and beyond. In addition, we expect to grow capital expenditures substantially, as we continue to fund the ongoing data center expansion effort that we have underway.
Finally, I wanted to share some plans on the use of cash starting in 2017. Beginning in January, we intend to fund withholding taxes due on employee equity awards via net share settlement rather than our current approach of requiring employees to sell our shares of common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. We expect this change will increase our cash outflows and correspondingly result in less dilution. If we had used this approach in 2016, our cash outflows would have increased by approximately $1.8 billion in the year through September.
To wrap things up, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. Our results reflected the continued growth in engagement of our community around the world and the strength of our mobile ads business.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one, the past couple quarters you've given us a metric on the growth in time spent per user across the three big platforms. Any update at all on that around this quarter and what you're seeing?
And then the second one, just on the Instagram Stories 100 million DAUs, any help at all on what the demographics or the age of those people look like? And how do you think about engagement of those users? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
I can take the first one, Brian, on the time spent metric. We're pleased with the growth in time spent per DAU that we're seeing across the Facebook family of apps. And that includes the Facebook mobile app, where we saw good year-over-year growth in time spent per DAU. Their video is making a big contribution to time spent growth, but we are not providing a specific stat on time spent growth on an ongoing basis.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
We're also not providing a specific breakdown of the DAU growth in Instagram Stories, but we're really excited about the engagement with the product and how it's growing across the board.

The next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions, maybe one for Sheryl and one for Dave. Sheryl, on local business and small business, as you continue to see success there, I wondered if we could get increased color on what you're seeing from an adoption curve on business pages. What are people looking for in terms of measurement attribution? What's Facebook delivering for those advertisers? Any color there would be very, very helpful.
And then, Dave, as we try to digest some of the comments you made about ad load and revenue as we exit 2016, go to 2017, how should we also be thinking about the mix of ad units as you continue to see more e-commerce and video in the platform? And how should we be thinking about the pricing of ad units as that mix changes over time? Thanks so much, guys.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
On local, we think this is a really big opportunity, and you see this in the large base of existing businesses using Facebook and Instagram increasingly. There are 60 million small business pages up on Facebook and 1.5 million Instagram business profiles, which are the similar, the equivalent for Instagram.
And the reason we think people are so active is it's just really expensive and hard to have your own mobile site or your own even webpage. Thirty-five percent of small businesses in the United States, which is the most developed market in many cases, don't even have a webpage of any kind. And it's cheaper and easier to build a webpage than it is to build a mobile app and get distribution or downloads.
And so what's happening is that people are really using the Facebook business pages and increasingly the Instagram business profile as their mobile presence, and we think that's what's working. And then we're working hard to build products that work, in-store visits, and then to use simplified ad products that convert them over to advertising.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Eric, it's Dave. Just really reiterating what I said last quarter about our expectations on ad load going into mid-2017, it's been one of the key factors in terms of driving growth along with time spent – user growth and time spent growth and advertiser demand. So we continue to see good opportunities to grow time spent, continue to see good opportunities to grow users, and we continue to see good opportunities to grow advertiser demand.
On that latter point, really the mix of ad units is part of what we're doing I think really well. We're developing a number of new ad products as well as enhancing the ad products that we have out in the market today. So we're taking what is a great mobile ad product on Facebook and Instagram and making it even better. And I think the investments that we're doing there will continue to enable us to drive advertiser demand. So those key factors will continue, we believe, to drive growth next year. So what I'm specifically talking about is ad load and our anticipation that it's going to be a less significant factor as we get into mid-2017.

The next question is from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. For Mark, in terms of video and your broader media content strategy, just trying to think about your investment in Facebook Live, and then trying to frame that against investments in I guess non-live forms of video, such as maybe short form, prerecorded, professional content. So how do you weigh investing in live versus let's call it on-demand content?
And maybe a related question would be, FOX Sports and Sports Illustrated are co-producing some original content for Facebook Live. I think they're doing a pregame show ahead of the big game tonight. So that seems like, in some ways, it's an entree into sports perhaps for Facebook. Could you give us an update on whether or not you see any advantage or any benefit in licensing sports content over time versus having one of the publishers do it on the Facebook platform? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So there was a lot in there, and I'll address most of it. The video-on-demand content is the vast majority of video that is both shared and consumed on Facebook, not live video, but live is growing very quickly. And part of the reason why we're investing in it is we see that video as a medium is not only in the future going to be about people producing content that looks like traditional content and then consuming it in a static rectangle video screen.
So live video we think represents an example of something new, which is video which is a medium for doing something that's really interacting with other people. Whether you're a public figure that is using it to hold a town hall or interact with a lot of people at the same time, or you're hanging out with your friends by going live and you have 10 people who are just there with you chatting with you while you're doing something, going about throughout your day, it's not the kind of traditional video experience; it's actually a more social experience.
I think 360 videos in another way are another example of this kind of interactive video experience, and my guess will be that we will see more different kinds of video media as time goes on. I think Stories is another example of this. We're seeing it with Instagram Stories and with Messenger and the initial test that we have with Messenger Day, where that is another interesting format for how you can put videos together. And I think that's going to be more and more.
But to put that all in context, the majority of consumption today is video on demand. We are very interested in making sure that the business model that we have works for folks who produce content as their business to make sure they can make money from it, so that their best content comes on Facebook. So it's going to be a lot of growth in all of these things across all our family of apps.
Operator
The next question is from Mark May with Citi. Your line is open.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks a lot. I think the first one is for Mark. When you went mobile-only or started this concept, you had to tweak the app because it wasn't necessarily optimized for mobile. As now you begin to move to more of a video first approach, what needs to happen to the Facebook app both from a consumer-facing and from an ad tools perspective to make sure that you're optimized for video? What needs to change?
And then I think the next question is for Dave. As the rate of growth in ad loads slows and also as you continue to enhance targeting and as more video advertisers come onto Facebook, would you expect that eCPMs will rise and offset part, if not all, of this impact of the ad loads slowing? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So I can talk about shifting to put video first across our whole family. There are two broad sets of improvements that I think we need to make. One are to the capture and sharing tools that we offer. So the example of that is the new camera that we're working on and all the creative tools around that. And then on the other hand, we also need to improve the infrastructure to deliver the best videos to people and do that quickly.
So if you think about what is enabling video to become huge right now, it's that fundamentally the mobile networks are getting to a point where a large enough people around the world can have a good experience watching a video. If you go back a few years and you tried to load a video in News Feed, it might have to buffer for 30 seconds before you watched it, which wasn't a good enough experience for that to be the primary way that people shared. But now it loads instantly. You can take a video and upload it without having to take five minutes to do that, so it's a good experience.
So we're very focused on creative tools. You can see that a little bit in the announcement and launch of Instagram Stories and what we're doing with Messenger and some of the additional tests on Facebook and the camera work that we're doing in WhatsApp. So this is across the whole family of apps. This is a big part of the product experience that we want to deliver.
And then on the actual delivery of video side, it's just much more intensive technically. So there aren't that many companies that can do this at the scale that we're talking about, and this has been a big advantage for us. In rolling out things like Live, we've had this infrastructure that we've been building out for a decade all around the world, and that allowed us to build a product like Live where someone has to stream something live from their phone to potentially hundreds of thousands of people around the world. From a phone, that's a difficult scaling problem. So we've been able to build that up, not just because of the ongoing investment in technology and infrastructure here, but because we're building on this strong base.
That goes not only for just being able to deliver the content, but being able to understand what it is so we can rank it in News Feed better and show people the right content. But all of these things are going to be part of a cohesive experience to get behind our community. And when people are ready and want video to be the primary way that they're sharing and consuming content, we're going to be there ready.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Mark, on ad load growth slowing and the impact on effective CPMs, I think when you look at our business, demand has been one of the key factors driving growth. So we've built up a large base of advertiser demand. We've got 4 million advertisers on Facebook; 0.5 million advertisers on Instagram. We continue to innovate on the products to make them more effective and make this a great gateway for businesses to come onto Facebook and come into mobile and spend. And we expect we've got a lot of great opportunities to continue to innovate on that front. But we've also been innovating over the past several years. So demand has been a big factor in what's been driving our growth to date. On top of that, we've grown users and time spent, and then we've also grown ad load.
So I do think as we look into 2017, we do expect that as you get to mid-2017, ad load will be a less significant factor contributing. We'll continue to get benefits of being able to grow our revenue with advertiser demand and continuing to innovate there. But I do think that as we slow ad load growth, we're going to have a slowing in revenue as well. So that's our expectation, but obviously we're going to continue to work hard to innovate in the ad product space.

The next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, two questions. A product question for Mark, in trying to – you're talking about some of these features and making the camera more of a central way of communicating on Facebook. How long do you think the iterations or the testing is going to go until, as an average user, I would notice that in my News Feed? Like I do see much more prevalence of live video, and it doesn't seem to me yet a perfect experience. But just in terms of other features and putting the camera at centerpiece, do you think this is something that's going to be obvious to people in the next year, couple of months? Just what's the timing of the innovations?
And then real quickly, MAU growth seemed to accelerate in both Asia and rest of world. Any color on what would have caused that or any particular markets? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
I can take the MAU growth first, and then Mark can talk about camera. On the MAU front, we're seeing very strong overall growth in terms of the 240 million-plus MAUs that we added.
If I was to point to – there's really no single driver, but I'll point to a few that contributed. And it also plays into the fact that we're seeing good growth in places like India, Mexico, Brazil, and others. First, we're improving our Android experiences, and we've talked about the impact that Facebook Lite has had on that, just making easier registration processes, just making Android – our lightweight Android app easier to use. Secondly, Mark talked about the internet.org efforts that we have. That's been a contributing factor to MAU growth. And then finally, we're seeing the introduction of low-priced data plans in markets like India and Mexico contributing. So there's no single factor, but those are all contributing factors in terms of MAU growth.
And then, Mark, do you want to talk about the camera?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So we already rolled out the first test of the new camera in Ireland. And we're a company that believes in testing things and getting feedback from our community before we roll it out broadly. We think we have a lot to learn. And the methodology of how we develop is we try to build things quickly. And rather than just relying on our own intuition, although we do rely on that a lot, we will try to put it out in the market and get feedback and then roll it out from there. So we rolled out what we believe is a good experience in Ireland. They were the first part of the community to get access to these new features. And then from there, we'll start to roll it out broadly across the world, hopefully sooner rather than later.
Same thing on the Messenger side, as I mentioned, these products around my day, it's a similar video medium to Instagram Stories and a similar camera to what we're building in the Facebook app as well. And that we rolled out in a few countries as well. And similarly, based on the feedback that we're getting, I would expect that we'll be rolling that out pretty widely across the world soon as well.

The next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. We're going to stick with video, one for Mark and then one for Sheryl. Mark, how do you think about, whether with video in terms of doing it on core Facebook itself or on a separate video app, some of the puts and takes there between those two?
And then, Sheryl, can you just talk about with video, how you see marketers using Facebook more to complement TV and what it would take to shift dollars over in a bigger way going forward? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So in the main Facebook app, we're doing a number of different things. One is that video is naturally becoming a larger share of the content in News Feed because both people and pages are sharing more videos as a mix and people want to consume that content. So there's not really a question of whether that should be a separate app. This is what people want News Feed to be increasingly, so this is what it will become.
There is a second experience called Video Home, which we started talking about earlier in the year. and we've rolled out again in a few markets, and those tests have gone well. So we're also hoping to roll that out pretty soon widely. And that's the new experience, which if you come to Facebook and you specifically want to watch some different kinds of videos or you want to see what videos a recent page that you follow has posted or the Presidential debate is on and you want to find a good place to go online to get that, you can go to Video Home and see that.
That is a new experience that we're building, and building that as part of Facebook is a great way for people to see it and get exposure to it, and we'll see where that goes over time. I think it's a good experience inside Facebook, but we also have had examples over time, like Messenger for example, where we started it in Facebook and decided that in order to fulfill their potential, it needed to be its own experience over time. So we'll look at all those options, but for now I really think that Video Home is going to be a great experience, and I'm excited to roll that out.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
When we think about video ads and what platform they run on, we really believe that over time the dollars will shift with eyeballs, and our goal is to be the best dollar and the best minute people spend measured across channels.
It's definitely true that most of our advertisers are advertising on TV and advertising with us on mobile, and they should be. And we've done studies that show with Nielsen that our ads can be a really big complement to TV, particularly enabling you to reach people who really aren't on TV and you can't reach.
I think the power of what we're able to do really goes to the targeting. And what we're seeing is big brand advertisers, and this is actually particularly strong growth. This quarter was particularly strong for brand, are really recognizing that they can do big brand buys on our platform like they would do on TV, but make them much more targeted.
So for example, Nestlé Purina PetCare did an ad campaign in Germany with ZenithOptimedia, and they defined five distinct cat owner personality types and created different creatives for each group. So that's a big brand thing. The cat food category is big and they want brand awareness. But rather than just run one ad, they were able to run five based on the interest base and personality targeting that really only we can do. And the results were amazing. They got an 89% increase in brand awareness and a 20% lift in sales. And so we think what we offer is the power of the broad reach of TV, but an ability to target much more efficiently.

The next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, I just have one for Mark. Any update on the revenue ideas for Messenger that might be getting traction? I know it's still early days, but any early indications there? And based on the three phases you laid out earlier in the call, when can we expect Messenger to move into Phase 3? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
So I'd say we're pretty early in Phase 2. Just to recap the framework that we have here, the strategy is there are three phases for that. We build and then build businesses around these apps.
The first is build an experience and get it to scale, to build a community that can get to hundreds of millions or 1 billion people or more. The second phase is help people not only interact with the people they care about, but also the businesses and other public entities that they care about as well. And then the third phase is once there's good organic interaction between people and those businesses, give those businesses tools that they can pay for to reach more people and amplify those interactions.
So I mentioned this stat earlier that we have about 33,000 bots that are live in Messenger, including experiences across a range of verticals, from news to e-commerce to local businesses and all kinds of different things, and we're seeing some early progress. I'd say we're still pretty early on in getting this to be widely rolled out. I think we're going to need many more than 33,000. And the number of people using them, I think it's still pretty early in terms of there are more than 1 billion people using Messenger, so we need to get that rolled out pretty widely. So I'm not sure that I have an answer for you just yet on exactly when we're going to move to the third phase.
The one thing that I would say in terms of making money through Messenger is we're already driving results for businesses by letting them advertise in News Feed to open up threads in Messenger, which is different from the long-term vision that we have here around creating interactions that start in Messenger. I think that that will ultimately be most of the value that's generated. But in the near term, what we've found is that a lot of businesses are creating ads in News Feed that then they can follow up and do transactions with people in Messenger, and I think that's going to be pretty meaningful over the next few years.

The next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thank you. I just had a couple questions left. One, I was just wondering. Given your comments on the local and small business opportunity, I'm wondering what your view is on Facebook's potential role in the payment ecosystem and how that might evolve over time. And also, if you could, share with us how the rollout of Instagram Shopping, which people have started to talk about, how that might evolve over time as well. Thank you.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
In terms of payments, we really see payments as primarily a way to enforce the other activities we want to see on Facebook and Instagram. So payments enable advertisers to pay us. We are using payments in some of our other products in ways that enable some of the interactions we want to see.
When we think about Instagram Shopping, it's very early tests, but it really follows the kinds of things we do in other areas of our products and services, like Messenger. What we see is that people in Instagram are using Instagram to browse for products and make those connections, and so we then make the product investments to make those a little bit easier. Similarly, to some of the things we've done in Messenger, some of the things we've done in Marketplace, we're watching for what is the organic activity between businesses and consumers, and then we're building products to enhance and enable that organic activity.

Your next question is from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, one for Sheryl. Sheryl, you guys have talked about your top verticals as being e-commerce, CPG, entertainment media, and gaming. And despite your really significant growth, I can think of some categories where you've got some more considered purchases where you're probably punching below your weight in terms of share, so auto, telecom, travel, financial services. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the unique challenges with those verticals and how you guys are attacking them. Thanks so much.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Facebook, Inc.
You have our top verticals correct, and we see a lot of strong growth in those verticals. Our top verticals this time are e-commerce, CPG, retail, and entertainment media. We do see growth in the other verticals as well. You're right that historically it took us a longer time to break into some of these, particularly travel and auto were things that took us longer, but we are seeing some really nice traction.
I talked about Mary Barra and what she and I did together in New York at Adweek, and we're seeing them not just use the platform for advertising but really use the platform. So earlier this year, they rolled out a car at CES on Facebook video rather than at a car show. And that was a big moment for us, I think, in the auto vertical. And we continue to work with them and lots of other partners.
Measurement is really key there. The better we can do with dealers and with auto manufacturers at measuring all the way through the purchase, the better off we are. And I think they know that people are doing the research for autos and the purchases they make, which is a very long sales cycle on their mobile phone, and they want us to be part of that.
Similarly with travel, this is a vertical that we are really investing in. We have rolled out different types of product ads that we think will help. So in Q2, we rolled out Dynamic Ads that were specifically focused on the travel vertical, and I'll share one example.
Celebrity Cruises used these Dynamic Ads for travel on both Facebook and Instagram to increase their online bookings. They worked with one of our FMPs, StitcherAds, and they created custom audiences who viewed specific itineraries by date. So they look for people that at a certain date have used specific itineraries and then created Dynamic Ads which showed the available cruises and pricing and had a Book Now button. They saw a three times increase in their online bookings and I think those kind of results are made possible by more vertical-specific products, and we're going to continue to invest there.

The next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, thanks for taking my call. Dave, could you clarify a bit on investment year, what that means? Does that mean expenses growing faster than revenues? And then I think Mark mentioned $250 million on content for VR. Anything else in there that we should be thinking about? And then maybe one housekeeping, ad blocking, could you quantify how much that might have helped desktop revenues? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
Justin, just on investment year, I'm not giving specific commentary around revenue growth versus expense growth. What I wanted to provide was just some color around our thinking about investment going into 2017. Obviously, on the CapEx side, we've got a number of projects underway on the data center front. So clearly on that front, we've got a lot of projects that are going to need ongoing funding going into 2017, so that we've got good visibility on.
In addition, while it's too early to give specifics, I want to give some directional color around expense growth. We've already invested in accelerating our recruiting efforts, so I wanted to highlight that. That's primarily around technology, technical recruiting, software engineering, and we have a lot of opportunities that we see to invest in the long-term growth of the business. And so that's our plan going into 2017.
On ad blocking, in terms of the impact, I would just point out that this quarter we had 18% year-over-year desktop revenue growth. If you look at recent quarters, it was about half of that growth rate on a year-over-year basis. So that increment, that acceleration in desktop revenue growth is largely due to our efforts on reducing the impact of ad blocking. So that's what led to the acceleration of desktop revenue growth.

The next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. You've been tweaking the News Feed algorithm to prioritize friends and family, original content. We're curious what kind of impacts you're seeing there. And is it driving more engagement and more sharing of originals? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure. So News Feed is an ongoing work that we're always improving. What we basically are trying to do is work on over time adding more and more signals to the News Feed model to help us fully value what people in the community value about the different content that we show them. So what we realized was that the model that we had previously didn't fully capture the nuance in how people preferred certain content from friends and family. So we ran a bunch of qualitative studies and talked to a bunch of people and incorporated those signals into the model, and that has had the result that the people in our community who gave us that feedback and who we worked with on this, what we had expected in terms of both increasing the quality of the content that people see, and therefore also enabling people to share more with their friends and the people that they want.
But one thing that I would clarify is that I think sometimes people – in your framing of your question, you asked if we had tweaked News Feed to do this or that. This is an ongoing iterative process. We're constantly learning about what our community wants, and we will constantly be trying to incorporate new information and signals into the models to help value all of the content in the system as accurately as possible. The biggest job that we have is to show people in the community what's going to be meaningful and important to them, and that is our goal in all of these changes.

The next question is from Youssef Squali with Cantor. Your line is open.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Yes, thank you, two questions. About AI, can you help us understand your ambitions for MVO executed (53:39) in its current form? Does it have a place in the workplace, or internally maybe to enhance productivity, et cetera?
And about the additional functionality you've added to Pages with the delivery and a few others, can you just help us understand what you're doing around discoverability? How will people actually find these services, and do you need tools for that? And maybe timing, how quickly can we see these tools being rolled out? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
I did not fully understand the first question, so I'm going to talk about our AI work overall. In general, what we want to do is try to understand the content that people are sharing and that's out there for them to see as best as possible. So for example, that means being able to read and understand news articles or posts that people make or messages that a person might send to a business so we can help that business auto-reply to them and get information back to the person really quickly, or understand the content so we can better understand what might be interesting to a person and show it in News Feed.
Similarly, aside from the conversational and linguistic understanding, there's a whole thread of the work that we're doing on visual understanding. So understanding photos, what's in photos, what's in videos, what people are doing. That allows us to not only do things around accessibility, to show somebody who is visually impaired to be able to read to them what might be in a video or a photo. But it also helps us rank News Feed better, so that way we can help understand what is in the content and show people more of what is going to be meaningful to them. It helps us identify content that might be offensive or graphic that might violate the policies of Facebook so we can flag that and review that better.
So that's the main thread of the AI work we're doing is trying to understand conversational and linguistic context and computer vision, photographic and video signals to understand what's going on there. And that will apply across basically every product that we build at the company. And then of course, there's some deeper AI research that we're doing that feeds into those applications as well. That can apply to things like ranking for News Feed and search and ads and all of our systems more broadly.
David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc.
On the discoverability of pages, a couple of things that I would point out there. First, we continue to invest in search. So obviously, that's a good way for people to discover interesting pages, interesting businesses around them, so search is one angle there.
And then of course, ads, we've got 60 million businesses with pages. They manage those pages and then they can promote those pages via our easy-to-use ad products. We try to make it very easy for businesses to promote pages, promote posts and the like. So that's an important on-ramp to mobile advertising for a number of businesses around the world. Those are the two ways that I think of from enhancing discoverability of pages on Facebook.
Deborah Crawford - Facebook, Inc.
Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
Operator
Okay, the last question is from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great, thanks. Just as it relates to video search, do you think that Facebook has the video content depth at this point for users to search for video content and be pleased with the experience?
And then second for Mark, while Facebook embarks on its video first strategy, how should we think about Facebook also evolving into a transactional platform with the recent introduction of the Marketplace? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc.
Sure, so search is an area that we've been working on for a while to improve. I don't know what the most recent public stat is on that. So I'm not going to say a stat, but it's grown a lot. So we're happy with that and we think that reflects that people are getting value from the search experience, which a lot of the growth comes from people searching for posts and content in the system, not just looking up people and pages in the system. So on search, there's that.
And then of course, I think that search is often driven by what unique content is in a system and not just the ability to find it. So I think what people are going to search Facebook for are finding people and content that they know is on Facebook and that isn't in other places. And that I think is driving most of the volume today and I think can get us to be – we're already one of the largest search engines in the world, but to be even bigger on that front.
You asked about transactions as well. And we've spent a lot of time on this call talking about putting video first. That has certainly been the biggest theme of the last quarter and is the biggest part of the product strategy for Facebook and Instagram and is a big part of the product strategy for Messenger and WhatsApp as well. In terms of transactions, one of the big things that we see happening in messaging long term is that it's a great channel for people to interact with a business one on one and either do transactions in a private space or get support, or for businesses to reach out with very personally tailored messages and have an ongoing engagement with a person. So that's something that we're very excited about building. And that is going to be the business that we hope to build on Messenger and WhatsApp over time. So we're looking forward to that.
Marketplace I think is going to be a great example of this too. What we're seeing in pages and marketers on Facebook is they want to both get awareness and drive all the way down to generating transactions, and Marketplace I think is going to help people do that. We're starting with people being able to sell things and connect to other people who want to buy them, just like they've been doing in for-sale groups for many years, but we're excited to evolve this and grow it over time as well.

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. We had another good quarter and first half of the year. Our community continues to grow around the world. 1.7 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.1 billion people use it every day. Our business is growing at a healthy rate as well. Total revenue grew by 59% year-over-year to $6.4 billion and advertising revenue was up 63% to $6.2 billion.
Our results show our progress as we work to make the world more open and connected across our three-year, five-year, and ten-year horizons. Over the next three years, we're focused on continuing to build our community and help people share more of what matters to them. The next five years are about building our newer products into full ecosystems, developers and businesses. And over the next ten years, we're working to build new technologies to help everyone connect in new ways.
I'll give an update on our progress across each of these areas. Starting with how we're working to
deliver better experiences for our community and more ways for people to share and more of what they care with anyone they want.
We continue to see excellent growth in our community. Over the past year, we've added over 200 million people using Facebook on a monthly basis. And in the second quarter, time spent per person increased double-digit percentages year-over-year across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet.
One of the biggest opportunities to grow our community is in developing countries where connectivity is less advanced than what we take for granted here at home. So, over the past couple of years, we've been making steady improvement throughout to make them work regardless of the device or connection that people are using. We've also built a lightweight version of our Android app called Facebook Lite that's tuned to work on 2G networks and is now used by more than 100 million.
We're also working on new tools to help people express themselves and understand what's going on with the people they care about. Ten years ago, most of what we shared and consumed online was text. Now it's photos, and soon most of it will be video. We see a world that is video first with video at the heart of all of our apps and service.
Over the past six months, we've been particularly focused on Live video. Live represents the new way to share what's happening in more immediate and creative ways. This quarter, Candace Payne's Chewbacca mask video was viewed almost 160 million times. Live is also changing the way we see politics, as news organization, delegates go live from the Republican and Democratic conventions, and we've seen in Minnesota and Dallas how Live can shine a light on important moments as they happen.
This quarter we also launched 360 Photos. You don't need a special camera to take them. You just take a panorama or use the 360 cam or app on your phone and post it. And since we launched, more than 4 million 360 photos have been shared on Facebook with 1 million more being shared every week.
We're making good progress on core services within the Facebook app, like search. A growing way that people use search is to find what people are saying about a topic across the more than 2.5 trillion posts in our network. Now people are doing more than 2 billion searches a day between looking up people, businesses, and other things that they care about. Continuous steady improvement in services like search are an important part of helping people connect and realizing our mission.
We're also improving the experience for our community by building our business with more engaging ads. We've also emphasized the importance of measurements and value in driving real results for the businesses that use Facebook, and that means helping them create more relevant and engaging ads. Over the next five years, we're working hard to build ecosystems around some of our newer products.
Instagram now has more than 500 million monthly active with more than 300 million daily. Now we're working to make that experience even more engaging. Recently, Instagram began to rank its feed because we know that people have a better experience when they see more of the stories they care about. We're already seeing a positive impact in terms of time spent and the amount of content that people are sharing. We've also introduced our advertising tools on Instagram and we're seeing marketers engage with people in creative and innovative ways.
In the two years since we separated Messenger from the main Facebook app, which was a pretty controversial decision at the time, we've improved performance and given people new ways to express themselves. And now, for the first time, more than 1 billion people are using Messenger every month.
I'm also happy with the updates we're making to WhatsApp, which also has a community of more than 1 billion people. This quarter, we launched new desktop apps, end-to-end encryption and millions of people are using WhatsApp's voice calling features.
The scale we've achieved with our messaging services makes it clear that they are more than just a way to chat with friends. That's why we're also making it easier for people to connect in groups and businesses as well. We're going to keep focusing on this over the next several years.
I'm also excited about the early progress we're making on our ten-year initiative. We're investing in new technologies to give more people a voice, including, of course, the 4 billion people around the world who aren't yet online. And we're helping more people take advantage of the opportunities that come with the internet.
We're still early in our journey, lots of hard work ahead. But we're making good progress, like the first successful flight of Aquila, our solar powered aircraft that will beam Internet to places that have never been connected. Eventually, we're going to work with telecom operators and governments around the world to connect people on the outskirts of cities, rural areas, and disastrous zones where you can't get traditional connectivity today.
We've also been making progress with our initiatives around artificial intelligence and virtual reality. This quarter, we announced DeepText, a deep learning based engine that can understand the context of several thousand posts per second across 20 different languages. This is a long-term project, but it also has some near-term benefits like helping show people more of what they want to see and filtering out less of what they don't want to see.
We're also investing in new platforms to help people connect and share. We believe that virtual reality can help people share richer experiences and help everyone understand what's going on around the world. It's really early for us in VR, but we're hitting some important milestones. As of the second quarter, more than 1 million people a month are now using Oculus on mobile phones through our Gear VR partnership with Samsung. More than 300 apps are already available at the Oculus store for Gear VR. We filled all of our preorders for Oculus Rift and we're seeing increasing demand from retail stores planned for the holidays. While it's still early for augmented reality, we're doing AR research and are seeing lightweight versions of AR technology in mobile apps like MSQRD.
So that's a recap of the progress that we're making in our ten-year plan. We have a saying at Facebook that our journey is only 1% done. And while I'm happy with our progress, we have a lot more work to do to grow our community and connect the whole world. That means making big investments and taking risks, focusing not just on what Facebook is but on what it can be.
I want to thank everyone in our community, all of our teams, our partners and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. And now here's Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a great second quarter. Q2 ad revenue grew 63%. Mobile ad revenue reached $5.2 billion, up 81% year-over-year, and was approximately 84% of total ad revenue. Our growth was broad-based across verticals, marketer segments and regions.
We're excited to announce that we now have 60 million monthly active business pages on Facebook. We also continue to grow the number of active advertisers on our platform. This shows that both our free and paid products are providing value to marketers of all sizes around the world. We continue to focus on our three priorities, capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. For 32 years, the advertising industry has gathered in (9:55) to celebrate creativity. People have shifted to mobile and marketers know they need to catch up. Mobile is no longer a nice to do, it's a must do, and we're working closely with marketers to help them make this transition.
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently in mobile feeds. The goal is to create what we think of as thumb-stopping creative, videos that grab attention in the first few seconds even without sound. For example, to drive awareness for Sour Patch Kids Gum, Mondelez targeted teens with non-chocolate candy interests. Working with the VaynerMedia, Carat and the Facebook Creative Shop, they created punchy, ten-second looping videos tailored for Facebook and Instagram. The campaign helped the Sour Patch Kids portfolio beat sales benchmarks for the entire candy industry.
We're excited to bring more relevant video ads to people both on and off Facebook. In May, we expanded Audience Network to include video for brand objectives. This means that advertisers can place video, brand video ads, not just on Facebook and Instagram, but across a network of apps and sites.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Over a third of small businesses and medium businesses in the U.S. don't have a website and having a mobile presence is even more difficult and expensive. Creating a business page on Facebook is as easy as setting up a personal profile. This is why Facebook pages are the mobile solutions for many of the 60 million businesses using our products each month in the U.S. and around the world. We've made it easy for business owners to manage their Facebook page from their mobile device. Over 85% of active business pages use mobile, and 40% of active advertisers have created a Facebook ad on their mobile device.
In Q2, we rolled out new tools to make it easier for businesses to promote posts and track performance directly from the Instagram app. We've worked hard to make becoming an advertiser as easy as possible for these businesses. With just a few steps and for as little as a few dollars, businesses can boost their posts to reach more people. Simplifying our ad products is key to advertiser acquisition. Over 80% of new advertisers in Q2 started with simplified products like boosted posts. Once these businesses begin advertising with us, we make it easy for them to take advantage of even our most sophisticated capabilities.
For example, Lighting Etc., a third generation family-owned business used Facebook and Instagram ads to drive in-store sales. They targeted 25-year-old to 45-year-old homeowners interested in interior design living within 35 miles of their showroom in Fort Worth, Texas. It was striking to them that on Facebook, the size of our community meant that they could reach over 300,000 people even with such specific targeting. They've seen a 40% increase in revenue in 2016, and they attribute this increase to their ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Our third priority is making our ads more effective and relevant. Our goal is to help our clients grow their businesses, whether it be moving products off shelves, driving online sales or building their brands. Our system constantly looks for the most efficient and effective way to drive these objectives. Businesses that want to build their brands need to reach a large audience with a compelling story, and they're seeing strong results from immersive formats like video and Canvas ads.
Businesses working to acquire new customers need to reach high quality leads and convert them to actions. We introduced lead ads in Q1 to make it easy for people to fill out forms on mobile devices right from News Feed. In Q2, we made it possible for advertisers to retarget people who opened or completed a lead ad form. For example, Nissan Turkey and the SCM agency used lead ads to collect over 20,000 high quality leads from people interested in buying a new car. They then used retargeting to show relevant ads to people who had completed these lead ads and ultimately drove vehicle sales. The cost of a high quality lead was 9.3 times lower on Facebook than all other online media.
Businesses selling products are getting search like ROI from dynamic ads. Dynamic ads allow advertisers to upload their product catalogs and target people with specific products in real-time. Over 300 million people see dynamic ads each month and over 2.5 billion unique products have been uploaded by marketers. In Q2, we expanded dynamic ads to Instagram and also launched dynamic ads for travel. For example, you can now advertise specific destinations and dates for hotel rooms.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our three priorities. With only a small fraction of our 60 million business page is advertising, we have a lot of opportunity ahead. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help businesses make the shift to mobile and to drive results for our clients.
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and their ongoing input, which informs our product development. I also want to congratulate our global teams on the results of their hard work and thank them for their dedication to our mission.
Thanks, everyone. And now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for Facebook. Total revenue grew 59% to $6.4 billion and we generated over $2 billion in free cash flow. These results highlight the continued growth and engagement of our global community and the strength of our ads business as advertisers benefit from our increasingly broad and deep portfolio of targeting, creative and measurement tools.
Let's start with our community metrics. This past quarter was our strongest in over three years in terms of absolute year-over-year growth of monthly and daily actives on Facebook. In June, 1.13 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of 1.71 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of June.
Mobile continues to drive our growth, with over 1 billion people accessing Facebook via mobile devices on an average day in June, up 22% compared to last year. The growth of our other services also continues to be strong. WhatsApp and Messenger now each have over 1 billion monthly actives and Instagram surpassed 500 million.
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Total Q2 revenue was $6.4 billion, up 59%. Q2 ad revenue was $6.2 billion, up 63%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall revenue growth rate this quarter as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others. U.S. and Canada, and Asia-Pacific were our fastest growing regions with advertising growth rates of 69% and 67% respectively. Mobile ad revenue was $5.2 billion, up 81%, and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
Let's turn to the supply and demand factors that continue to drive our growth. Advertiser demand was particularly strong in Q2 across a broad range of verticals and advertiser objectives. Additionally, supply side factors, including growth in users, time spent and ad load, all contributed to our Q2 revenue growth. In Q2, the average price per ad increased 9% while total ad impressions increased 49%. The reported increase in price was again driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile where we only show higher price News Feed ads compared to the mix of News Feed ads and lower priced right-hand column ads on personal computers.
The 49% increase in total ad impressions was driven primarily by growth in ad impressions served in Facebook mobile News Feed where the majority of our ads are shown. Payments and other fees revenue was $197 million, down 8%. Remember that payments and other fees revenue largely generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q2 total expenses were $3.7 billion, up 33%, inclusive of $825 million of share-based compensation related expenses as well as $193 million of amortization of intangible assets. Q2 operating income was $2.7 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. We continue to be pleased with the profitable growth of the business while we invest for the long-term.
We ended Q2 with approximately 14,500 employees, up 32% year-over-year. We added about 900 employees in the quarter, the majority of those in technical functions. We are seeing continued success with our efforts to hire top talent in a market that remains very competitive.
Our Q2 tax rate was 26%. GAAP net income was approximately $2.1 billion or $0.71 per share. Q2 capital expenditures were $1 billion. Year-to-date capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. Facebook generated over $4 billion in free cash flow in the first half of 2016. And as of June 30, we had over $23 billion in cash and investment.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We have been pleased with the strength of our advertising revenue in the first half of 2016. As I discussed on our last call, while we expect the main drivers of our advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, we will face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the accelerating revenue growth rates we experienced in the second half of 2015. Consequently, we anticipate lower advertising revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016.
Additionally, we anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months, and then will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017. Since ad load has been one of the important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth, we expect the rate at which we are able to grow revenue will be impacted accordingly.
Turning now to expenses. Based on our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are tightening our expense guidelines ranges. We expect that full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 35%, narrowed from our prior range of 30% to 40%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million, and full year 2016 stock-based compensation related expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion.
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization, will grow in the range of 45% to 50%, narrowed from our prior range of 45% to 55%. We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately $4.5 billion as we invest to support the rapid growth of our business. Finally, we expect that our Q3 and full year 2016 tax rates will be similar to our Q2 rates.
In summary, Q2 was another great quarter for Facebook, illustrated by the strong growth and engagement of our global community and continued broad-based strength of our ad business. We're pleased with the results, and we will continue to invest in order to best position Facebook for our long-term growth opportunities.
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. [Operation Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two. One on the video platform going forward and how you think about video as a distribution mechanism. How should we think about investments that need to be made in video on both technical infrastructure side as well as the sourcing of content type sort of broadened out the video offering over the next couple of years? And then maybe on the last comment on ad load, just wanted to go back to that for a minute in terms of what you're seeing on ad load by region, because we're seeing a widening gap in revenue per user between U.S. and Canada and the rest of the world. How much of that might be driven by ad load or ad products? Thank you so much.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. I can take the question on video distribution as it relates to CapEx and the ad load question, and then maybe on the sourcing of content, I'll pass it back to Sheryl. So, on the video platform, clearly, from a investment perspective, you've seen us step up our CapEx this year pretty substantially. And that's baked into the guidance of $4.5 billion of CapEx which, if you recall, is at the high end of our prior range. We are investing across our infrastructure to prepare ourself for growth across all of our different services. And part of that investment is really to support video. That is definitely more taxing on the network and we're investing heavily on the network side. And as well, it does also impact our overall needs within the data center, servers and the like. So it's certainly an area that we're investing in heavily and we expect to be investing in heavily going forward, Eric.
And then on the ad load question, ad load is not something that varies that dramatically by region. So you're really looking at a number of factors. Really what's driving that is just the dispersion of overall ad demand across region. And we're seeing really good strength across the globe on that front, but ad load is not a big driver of discrepancies in ARPU that you see. That's really something that maps very closely to the size of the mobile ad markets per population in those countries. So it's not an ad load question.
And then I'll hand it over to Sheryl to talk about video from a content perspective.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
When you think about what's happening on video on our platform, we're really excited by the production and consumption of video, and we're seeing the full range from people posting the things in their personal lives. The power of what a mobile phone can produce and distribute now is pretty incredible, when you compare it to just a few years ago, to some of the most sophisticated content producers in the world producing for us.
We're experimenting across a wide variety of things. We're doing a partnership with the NBA to stream some U.S. Men's Olympic team games in the next couple of weeks. That said, our primary focus is on short form content, not long form content, and we're pretty excited to see the different forms of content people will create, both to share messages, to create new content and to engage audiences around the world.

The next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. I just have two. First on engagement, obviously, the DAU and MAU numbers were strong. You gave the increase in the daily activity as well in the double-digits. But can you just give us some color on the user trends underneath that a little bit, and more specifically perhaps what you might be seeing in terms of younger users in different age demographics?
And then secondly, just going back to the ad load, we have in the past heard some caution from you guys before in that area, and granted it was a few years ago and at a much earlier stage. But I guess my question is, if targeting continues to improve along with click-through-rate and then ultimately ROI, why does ad load have to become less of a factor going forward? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Doug. On the DAU and MAU front, couple of things. One is DAU and MAU are up sequentially and year-over-year on all regions, and with trends that are largely consistent with past quarters. So, really good strong growth across the globe on a DAU to MAU ratio. We don't do specific break downs of those metrics by demographic. We're obviously pleased with our overall level of growth in engagement.
On the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach the largest global audience of teens and millennials. Teens remain very – remain engaged on Facebook. Clearly, how they've used our service has evolved over the years. And in addition to Facebook, they're using Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. So, from a teen perspective, that's some color there.
On the ad load front, ad load is definitely up from where we were a few years ago. It has been an important driver of inventory growth. And really, I think one of the things that's enabled us to grow ad load has been improving the quality and the relevance of the ads, as you've mentioned. And we've been be able to do that without negatively impacting the user experience. We do expect that ad load will be a less significant factor driving overall growth, especially after mid-2017.
The optimal ad load is really a mix of art and science. We've carefully tracked the impact of ads on the user experience over the last several years. We aren't seeing a cause for concern. We also want to be thoughtful about making sure that each person's overall feed experience has the right balance of organic and ad content. And that factors into how we think about ad load and where that might ultimately be. And that's really why we're talking about our expectation that as you get into mid-2017, ad load will not be a big factor in driving overall inventory growth. We still see the opportunity to grow inventory from the growth of people and engagement on Facebook, as well as our other services like Instagram. Instagram does have a lower ad load than Facebook.

The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my question today. I have two. The first one on the U.S. advertising, it was up particularly strong. Any specific ad category, branded, direct response, et cetera, or add unit like video that's driving this growth in the U.S.? And then the second one, just on Live video, recognizing it's very early with Live video, but any help at all on what percentage of your users are engaging with Live video and the type of uplift you're seeing on engagement? Thanks.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Our growth this quarter was very broad-based across all of the regions. We had especially strong growth in APAC and the U.S. and Canada, so that was part of the growth. In terms of our marketer segments from brands to direct response to SMBs to developers, the growth is really strong there as well. We're really excited today to announce that we have 60 million small business pages that are using Facebook on a monthly basis. And we're very focused on the opportunity to upsell them to advertising products. We think we have a good track record there.
We're also seeing a lot of strength in brand. And I think that's because we have a combination of the creative and the story telling, so the art with the science of the targeting. And when people do that well together, you see great opportunities. So to share one example, Jack In The Box use our Canvas ads, which are very immersive ads. They're really good for a brand experience, to roll out a new menu item, their Double Jack burger. They worked with agencies Horizon, David & Goliath and Adaptly, and they targeted millennials on Facebook to create two different custom audience groups.
One group was customers who had visited the restaurant web page or engaged with previous video ads. And the second group were people that hadn't engaged with them directly but were quick service restaurant purchasers. They had an average view rate of 23 seconds across those Canvas ads, so clearly people were really engaged in the brand experience of the ads, and they had a 13-point lift in add recall and a 9-point lift in purchase intent.
And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brand marketers to direct response to SMBs to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurements get better. They have an increased opportunity to grow, and that's why we think our growth to-date continues to be broad-based.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, and, Brian, I'll take the Live video question. It's hard to compete with the Double Jack burger. But in terms of Live video, it's really early. We're really excited about it in terms of it providing an authentic and real form of sharing for people, and we're really trying to give people the full range of tools to share what they care about with anyone that they want, and Live is really effective there. And we've seen experiences both in terms of a lighthearted like Candace Payne and also more serious, more serious issues around the U.S. and around the globe. So it's really an important part of what we're offering for people to share real experiences. Video as a whole is making a significant contribution to time spent growth. So, when we talk about the time spent per DAU growing worldwide across our family in double-digit percentages, video is making a contribution there more broadly.

The next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Yeah, I have a couple. First, Mark, maybe on core Facebook, there's been commentary out there that maybe there's less personal sharing. Just maybe comments on the direction of Facebook? What the activities are going on, how you feel about that? And then just about the ad loads, I mean how are you deciding how much ads to show? Could you hold back a bit and drive higher pricing? How are you balancing that? And why not hold back a little bit more now for longevity there? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. So I'll talk about sharing, and then I think Dave can probably talk about ad loads and pricing. So, the overall level of sharing is up on Facebook. And what we're seeing is that how people share is evolving as we move from desktop to mobile, right. So you can imagine more photos on people's mobile cameras, fewer long full photo albums, more ability to capture video, probably a little bit harder to type on mobile. So there's this evolution.
The other thing that we see is that now people have tools to share more privately as well. So when you think about sharing on Facebook, you shouldn't just think about the kind of sharing that you see in News Feed, right. So sharing with all of your friends, sharing in groups on Facebook and public sharing, which are the trends that I was just talking about. But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day, which I think is something like three times more than the peak of global SMS traffic. So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well. And we're just going to continue working on giving people the best tools across the spectrum from private to public, and across the spectrum from text-based and simple communication to richer type of media like photos, videos, and then, eventually, more immersive forms like VR.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, and Justin, in terms of ad load, we've talked about the different factors that go into it, obviously, just in driving the overall business. Advertiser demand, that was particularly strong this period, and then also we matched that with supply. And the supply – the two big drivers are user and time spent and then ad load.
And getting the balance and mix right is important, and clearly, how the pricing plays out is via the auction. And we've had a good balance of demand growth and supply growth, and that's led to our good strong financial results and our ability to deliver very strong ROI to advertisers. So we think we're in a good zone on the right ad load, and we do think there's opportunities to grow that modestly. But as we look forward into 2017, we think it'll be a less significant factor driving inventory growth. But we still think there's opportunities to drive inventory through user growth and time spent.
I don't think we would think about necessarily dropping ad load to drive pricing. We're also very cognizant of providing good value to advertisers, and getting that balance right is important to driving overall ROI, as well as obviously providing better targeting and measurement tools for our advertisers.

The next question is from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have one for Mark and one for Sheryl. Mark, you mentioned search in your prepared remarks, two billion searches a day on Facebook. I also noticed you said you're making it easier for users to connect to businesses. How far away are you from commercial search on Facebook being viable? Why can't you do that today? And how big of an opportunity could commercial search be?
And then, Sheryl, you mentioned the expansion of the Facebook Audience Network. Can you talk more about the revenue opportunity of bringing Facebook's targeting tools to other video publishers? How fast is Audience Network monetization growing? Is it accelerating, for example, and how do you see the revenue opportunity of expanding the Audience Network across the mobile web as well? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I can take search. So when we talk about our strategy, I often talk about how when we develop new products we think about it in three phases. First, building a consumer use case; then, second, making it so that people can organically interact with
businesses; and then third, on top of that, once there's a large volume of people interacting with businesses. Give businesses tools to reach more people and pay, and that's ultimately the business opportunity.
So, I'd say, we're around the second phase of that in search now. You know, we have a pretty big navigational use case where people look up people and pages and groups that they want to get to and look at in search. One of the big growing use case is that we're investing a lot in is looking up the content in the ecosystem, and that is an area that we're very excited about, which helps people find more content. But certainly there's a reasonable amount of behavior in there which is looking for things that, over time, could be monetizable or commercial intent. And at some point we will probably want to work on that, but we're still in the phase of just making it easier for people to find all the content they want and connect with businesses organically.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On the Audience Network, we continue to invest in ad tech, and the Audience Network is a key part of our focus there. We don't break out revenue by our different platforms. But the opportunity to take not just video ads, but other ad formats we have, bring them to the rest of the web and other apps with our ability to target and measure, we think is a big one. And what we're starting to see is that people are using Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network to drive their objective in a cohesive way.
So to share an example, Garmin launched the Fenix 3 Sapphire watch, and they did it with videos ads on Facebook that worked without sound. They targeted outdoor enthusiasts then retargeted people who viewed the Instagram videos with Carousel ads on Facebook that highlighted the product features.
Then they extended those ads on Audience Network to maximize reach, and they used the Facebook Pixels to measure the incremental sales, and got to a 9.7 times return on ad sales. So that's a really good example of how you can take targeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel. And we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better job of combining the interfaces. So, for example, you can buy now in one interface on Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
And then, Anthony, just one thing to add on top of that, just the – we recognize the majority of our third-party advertising revenues of the Audience Network on a net rather than gross basis. So that will also minimize the impact that will have on the top line.

The next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Mark, when you see the what seems like phenomenal success of Pokémon Go, what are your reactions to that? And then, David, could you talk about the monetization ramp that you're seeing on the messaging platforms? I know it's still very early days. Anything in there that strike you as being particularly substantive for material yet? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I, like everyone else, am enjoying Pokémon Go. And the biggest thing that I think we can take away from this as we invest in augmented reality in addition to virtual reality, is that the phone is probably going to be the mainstream consumer platform that a lot of these AR features first become mainstream rather than glasses form factor that people will wear on their face. So I think we're seeing this in a number of places, whether it's location through Pokémon or some of the face filter activity. I referenced the MSQRD app that we acquired earlier in my remarks. That's a kind of a fun way to augment. You know, social experience that you're having with someone. I think that there's a big opportunity to build out that platform and a lot more functionality around that.
And one of the big themes that we're talking about here is becoming video first, right, and as people look for richer and richer ways to express themselves just like people in the past just shared a lot of text and photos on Facebook, we think that in the future more of that is going to be video. And more of these augmented reality tools I think are going to be an important part of delivering that experience to making that fun to use and expressive as it can be.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
And, Mark, we've talked about our strategy on how we go about monetizing the different apps in our portfolio, and we usually talk about it in terms of three phases. Phase one is really growing the user base and engagement. And we're really pleased with where we are with Messenger and WhatsApp in that perspective with it's over 1 billion monthly actives. The second phase is really working on buildings organic interactions between businesses and consumers; and then finally, the third phases is about building those commercial opportunities.
With Messenger, we're really at the beginning of phase two. Messenger today has 1 billion organic interactions between businesses and consumers each month. But in terms of where we are in having in terms of actual monetization, incredibly early on that front. We're really in the – in that phase two where we're really talking about building those organic interactions.

The next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering, and I guess this is a follow up on Anthony's question. Is there a way to think about maybe the percentage of your kind of top 100 customers, or however you want to define it, that might be using FAN as an ad on to their Facebook spending? I guess I'm wondering if you're seeing increasing leverage of FAN.
And then the other question would just be political spending, obviously, wasn't a big driver for you guys in 2012, but it does seem like it is potentially a great opportunity in the back half of the year. I was just wondering if you could comment on that at all. Thank you.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On the political spending, our business is broad-based, not that no one event drives our business, we're pretty large and diversified. And while the political campaign, obviously, a lot a money is spend in ads. That's also true of an Olympics; it's true of a World Cup, it's also true of a Super Bowl. And so, with all of these events taking place around the world, there's no one event that we think drives a huge portion of revenue.
That said, we are pleased by what's happened on Facebook for the elections cycle, not just on the paid side but actually on the organic side as well. We really see Facebook being embraced by politicians all over the world to get in touch with their constituents. And we're pleased with that. Every member of Congress right now has a Facebook presence.
And we're seeing people like, one example is Elise Stefanik, the youngest person in the Congress. She made a pledge when she was elected that she would explain every vote she takes, and she explains every vote she takes on Facebook. With shorter explanations if they're not controversial but longer explanations. That's the kind of mission based work that we're happy about because it brings people closer to the people who are representing them.
We don't break out how many advertisers are advertising on the Audience Network, but we're seeing solid and growing adoption of the Audience Network across the board, as we are with Instagram. And we think all of these platforms together really help give us the ability to serve our clients in a very leveraged way, and use the targeting and measurement capabilities we have invested in across multiple platforms.

The next question is from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, some people believe that much of what users see in their News Feed is driven by their behavior and preferences. And as a consequence, the stories they end up seeing are always, or almost always, in line with their existing views and preferences. Does this phenomenon in the end increase – does this phenomenon lead to increased adoption in use of Facebook creating more polarization of views and less effective communication, at least in some areas of people's lives? Mark, how do you think about this line of thought that because people see things that they are already in line with what they believe, communication is hindered? Second, when it comes to video ad formats, are you philosophically opposed to pre-rolls, and if yes, why? And if not, what is missing for you to adopt that? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So we have studied the effect that you're talking about, and published the results of our research that show that Facebook is actually, and social media in general, are the most diverse forms of media that are out there. And basically what – the way to think about this is that, even if a lot of your friends come from the same kind of background or have the same political or religious beliefs, if you know a couple of hundred people, there's a good chance that even maybe a small percent, maybe 5% or 10% or 15% of them will have different viewpoints, which means that their perspectives are now going to be shown in your News Feed.
And if you compare that to traditional media where people will typically pick a newspaper or a TV station that they want to watch and just get 100% of the view from that, people are actually getting exposed to much more different kinds of content through social media than they would have otherwise or have been in the past. So it's a good sounding theory, and I can get why people repeat it, but it's not true. So I think that that's something that if folks read the research that we put out there, then they'll see that.
What was the other question?
Unknown Speaker
Pre-roll.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Oh, pre-roll. I can take that one too. So we don't think it would be a good experience in News Feed, right, because a lot of when people are finding videos on Facebook is you're scrolling through News Feed, you're looking at what story seems interesting to you, which is why we did the auto play videos so that rather than having to take an action, you can just start experiencing the video automatically and continue watching it if it's something that you're interested in.
But if we started playing an ad in the middle of a feed before you got to the video, then that would really go against that. I think people just would watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that. But the important thing to keep in mind on this is we don't really – we don't need to do pre-roll because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content, you come to look at a feed and putting the ads in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for the user experience.

The next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. I had two product related questions for Mark. So, Mark, you guys mentioned when you released the latest Instagram MAU crossing the 500 million mark, you give out the breakdown of U.S., international. It looks like U.S. has been around 100 million for about the past nine months. So is that just a pause along the growth path or is there something else that you're seeing that's causing that growth to stall out a bit in light of what you just said about engagement being up since you did the algorithm reranking? Any color there would be helpful. And then the second question is just any update on Messenger M and how do you see that product potentially impacting engagement monetization on Messenger? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
On any update on M, I can start with that one. Do you -
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I was going to take that one.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Oh. You were going to take that one? On the Instagram MAU question, I don't think we're breaking out by region Instagram MAU. So, no, I don't think there's any update there that I'm aware of.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Yeah, so we just haven't updated that.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, all right.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so for M, we've released the Messenger platform M bot in the last six months – F8 was the big announcement there. And I think since then, I think we've announced we have more than 10,000 bots in the system, which are basically making it so that different businesses can build automated ways to communicate with people.
The way we think about this experience is that, qualitatively, I don't know a single person really who wants to call a business to get support or interact with it. Whether that's trying to get a reservation for a restaurant or getting customer support or calling to buy something. And those are slow interactions. They're synchronous. They consume your whole attention while you're doing them. And if we can make it so that you can have some of those interactions in an automated way where you fire off a text and then just get a response back quickly, but asynchronously so it doesn't take up your full attention, then I think that's going to be a much better experience that people really enjoy and like.
So we're in the experimentation phase I think with the platform. We're seeing a lot of good ideas getting tried out. And I personally enjoy a lot of the different bots that people are using or making, especially the news one where you get these digests at the end of the day of different kinds of content. And between that and M, which is kind of our own internal bot that we're building, I think that this is going to be an interesting area to watch and encourage more interaction between people and businesses and messaging.

The next question is from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Couple of questions for Mark. The first one, what are the lessons you're learning from seeing the growth of Snapchat and some of the other newer networks, particularly among young people? And obviously Facebook is continuing to do well but these things are growing. And then second, related to video, what are the key problems that you really think you need to solve for consumers and video producers and how is Facebook going to evolve to help solve those problems? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. And they're related. So, overall, people are spending more and more time on mobile, and that means that there are always more services that people use whether it's YouTube or there's some really interesting ones with younger folks, especially like musical.ly and live.ly that I think are pretty interesting as well, the Snapchat, which you mentioned.
And part of why I think you see this is that there are just so many different ways that people want to share so many different kinds of content, ranging from text to photo to video, just richer and richer and more immersive content. And also there's a range from private one-on-one type sharing to small groups, all of your friends at once, large interface communities, and then ultimately fully public. And there are different apps that explore different regions of that space and do a good job with it, and offer ideas that I think the whole market needs to learn from.
Right now, the big theme and strategy that we're executing is we're going to become video first. And what I mean by that is that there's this trend where ten years back, most of what you saw and shared online was text, and then we went through a phase where most of it is photos. And we really believed that, and call it five years, or whatever the period of time that it takes to get there, I think most of what people consume online is going to be video. And that means that there needs to be a whole range of new production tools and consumption experiences for enabling that.
For production, I think that means that you need to get the camera experience, and the experience for capturing and uploading videos that you've captured to be much better in a more central part the of the experience. On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like auto play in feed, but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in News Feed, as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. So I think you're going to see this across all of our apps. More focused on producing this kind of content, and making it first class to consume as well, both in private and public context. And I think that that's just a big trend across the market, and one of the big things that if we get right, I think it's going to unlock a lot of sharing and opportunities.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
And then just following up on Ross's question on Instagram in the U.S., because I think Ross, you were asking, we've provided some rough percentages around international and U.S., and I just wouldn't – I wouldn't – those are very approximate, and I wouldn't base any trending on that, on those percentages.

John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. For Instant Articles, I think it went live globally for all publishers around the time of F8 in April. Just wondering if you can provide an update on the progress and how you see Instant Articles evolving over the next couple of years? And then maybe Dave, on the 49% year-over-year impression growth, how much of that was driven by ad loads? Thank you.

If I can take Instant Articles quickly. I think it's going well. It's a good user experience. People like it. The hypothesis when we rolled it out was that if we removed the latency, which is often 10 seconds to 15 seconds of opening up a web view from News Feed that more people would read news. I think the initial data suggests that that's probably true. So that's good. We're getting more partners on. And over the long-term, I think one of the big things that we need to do is see if we can not only make this good for engagement for our partners, but also a really positive business driver for them too. So that's something that I'm excited about, and we'll hopefully have more news on that coming up.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
So, on the 49% year-over-year growth in impression, we're not providing a specific break down there. I would say that it's primarily driven by growth in Facebook mobile News Feed. We've talked about the drivers of supply being growth in DAU, growth in time spent per DAU and ad load, and obviously, we've given stats around rough stats around – we've given specific stats around DAU. We've talked about time spent per DAU being up double-digit. So I think you can make some assumptions around that. So that's probably the way to triangulate on that.
I think we have time for one more question, Chris.
Operator
Certainly. The final question is from Mark May with Citi. Your line is open.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks a lot. I had two as well. You probably won't give specific revenue numbers, but just if you're – if you kind of, in aggregate, look at some of the non-Facebook app revenue streams, if it is FAN, Instagram, et cetera. Curious to get a sense of the traction and materiality of those. Would you expect, Dave, that in aggregate, those would become kind of material, meaning that sort of 10% plus threshold sometime this year? Just trying to get a ballpark sense of the level of traction and diversification of revenue outside the core Facebook app. And then along the lines of your commentary around ad load, how should we be thinking about, your MAUs are obviously very significant, DAU to MAU quite high. Do you continue to see that as being a primary driver of ad impression and ad revenue growth going forward as well? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, thanks, Mark. Like you said, we're not specifically breaking out revenue numbers. One thing to just keep in mind is Instagram is known and operated property is represented gross in our revenue, so whereas as I mentioned the Audience Network is by and large going to be recognized net rather than gross. And so that is going to make it smaller in how it's going to appear in the revenue numbers. The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a contribution and as is the Audience Network.
In terms of ad load, as I said, it's been one of the factors driving supply, so it certainly has been helpful. But there's also DAU growth and time spent per DAU growth so time spent per person. And we continue to feel that there are opportunities to execute on those and to continue to grow inventory in that way. So that's where we would focus. You know, as we drive DAU faster than MAU, then that's going to increase that ratio, but we're really focused on driving DAU and time spent per person.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today.
We started 2016 off well. 1.65 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.09 billion people use Facebook every day. In recent weeks, we're also consistently seeing more than 1 billion people using Facebook on mobile every day.
We're also pleased with our business results. Total revenue this quarter grew by 52% year on year to $5.4 billion, and advertising revenue grew by 57% to $5.2 billion. I'll have more to say about these results in a minute, but first I want to talk about a proposal by our Board of Directors to reclassify Facebook stock.
At F8, I talked about our mission and how the work we're doing to connect the world is more important today than it's ever been. I walked through our 10-year roadmap, focused on building the technology to give everyone in the world the power to share anything with anyone. Bringing people together and giving everyone a voice takes a long-term commitment, not just over the next few years but over the next few decades. We're focused on the long term, and that's the main reason for today's proposal.
Facebook has always been a foundry-light company, so we can focus on our mission and build long-term value. This structure has served our shareholders well. Early on, we received some generous offers for companies trying to buy Facebook, and our structure helped us resist that pressure. More recently, we navigated a challenging transition to mobile. But because we were a controlled company, we were able to focus on improving the user and product experience of our apps first and then build a strong mobile business over time rather than being forced to do something shortsighted. And over the years, our structure has helped us make big bets on acquisitions like Instagram that were very controversial initially but were good decisions for our community and our business.
Facebook has been built by a series of bold moves. And when I look out into the future, I see more bold moves ahead of us than behind us. We're focused not on what Facebook is, but on what it can be and on what it needs to be, and that means doing bold things. A lot of what we're building today in areas like connectivity, artificial intelligence, and virtual and augmented reality may not pay off for years, but they're important to our mission of connecting the world. And I'm committed to seeing this mission through and to leading Facebook there over the long term.
Personally, there's another element to this. While helping to connect the world will always be the most important thing that I do, there are more global challenges that I also feel a responsibility to help solve to create a better world for my daughter and all future generations, things like: helping to cure all disease by the end of the century; upgrading our education system so it's personalized for each student; and protecting our environment from climate change. That's why Priscilla and I created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed to give 99% of our Facebook shares to advance human potential and promote equality.
Today's board proposal will allow us to maintain and improve the voting structure that has served us well and allow me to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In December, I also announced that I won't sell more than $1 billion worth of stock – Facebook shares per year over the next three years. That's still my commitment, and I'll update our shareholders on future plans beyond that. Dave will talk more about the mechanics of this proposal in his comments in just a few minutes.
But before we get there, I want also share a few more thoughts on the progress we've made this quarter. As I said before, our roadmap has three horizons. Over the next three years, we're going to keep investing in our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform. Today, people around the world spend on average more than 50 minutes a day using Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet.
This growth isn't happening because we came up with just one or two big changes. Our team has just worked day after day on lots of improvements over a long period of time, and that progress continued in the first quarter. We launched Reactions to help people express themselves in more ways, and we improved our products to work on different mobile networks and devices all over the world. Sheryl will talk more about this in a minute, but now more than 3 million businesses are using our advertising products every month. We've expanded our measurement capabilities so more businesses can see the results they get from ads. And we've made it easier for small and medium businesses to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that our larger advertisers use.
Over the next five years, we're going to build ecosystems around our products that are already being used by a lot of people. We're at the beginning of a golden age of online video. Video isn't just a single kind of content. We think it's a medium that allows people to interact in a lot of new ways. So that's why in addition to normal Internet video, we're also focusing on more interactive video experiences like Live and 360 video. I'm a big Game of Thrones fan, and the other week HBO and our Oculus team came out with a 360 video of the opening sequence of the show. And it's now the most watched 360 video on Facebook in any 24-hour period, with more than 12 million total views.
Earlier this month, we opened up Live to everyone. Live is just one part of our overall video effort, but we think it has a lot of potential. Friends go Live because it's unfiltered and personal. Actors and news anchors go Live because they can reach bigger audiences in some cases than they can on even their own shows. And if we do a good job, we think it's something that people will associate with Facebook, with interacting with people and not just watching content. But it's also a very new and small part of all of the videos that we see on Facebook today.
I'm also really excited about what we're building around messaging. Right now we have two of the top messaging apps in the world. Nine hundred million people use Messenger every month, and 1 billion people use WhatsApp every month. Between Messenger and WhatsApp, people send around 60 billion messages every day, and that's almost three times as many messages as SMS handled at its peak.
Over the past couple of weeks, we've talked about steps we're taking to build messaging into a platform that developers and businesses can build on. We have Thoughts for Messenger that let you do things like order flowers or get news without leaving your Messenger thread. But this is all very early, and we're rolling these experiences out carefully and slowly over time.
We're also very happy with the way that Instagram is growing, with more than 400 million actives and more than 200,000 businesses advertising every month. Now we're focused on making the user experience even more engaging. With more content on Instagram all the time, people are currently missing about 70% of what's in their feed. So that's why in the first quarter, we started rolling out Feed Ranking to help you see more of the posts that you care about. This is a long-term effort. But News Feed shows that ranking creates the best and most engaging experiences for our community.
Over the next 10 years, we're going to keep investing in new technology to help everyone connect. As part of Internet.org, we're building an open source telco infrastructure project called TIP [Telecom Infra Project] to make it cheaper to operate mobile networks. Free Basics, which helps people access tools for education, health information, and communication for free, now features more than 600 services, and it has brought more than 25 million people online. That makes it one of the most successful connectivity initiatives in the world.
We're also working to help people connect and share in a more natural and intuitive way. Artificial intelligence is a long-term effort for us, but we're already using it in lots of ways. Right now, our Moments app is using face recognition to help you share pictures with your friends. We're using AI to show the most relevant content in news feeds, filter spam and messaging, and even help blind people understand what's in their friends' photos by reading explanations of them aloud.
Finally, we're building technology in virtual and augmented reality that can change the way that we all experience the world. Gear VR started shipping late last year, and the response so far has been great. There are now hundreds of apps built specifically for Gear, and people have watched more than 2 million hours of video on it.
In Q1, we also started shipping Oculus Rift. We've got a lot of great content, with more than 50 games and apps built for Rift. And again, this is very early, and we don't expect VR to take off as a mainstream success right away. I really want to emphasize that. Most Rift early adopters are gamers and developers. But eventually, we believe that VR is going to be the next big computing platform, and we're making the investments necessary to lead the way there.
So that's our update for the quarter. As always, everything we do is focused on our mission to make the world more open and connected. And to get there, we're building technology that brings people together and that helps everyone in the world share anything they want with anyone. It takes a long-term commitment and it won't happen overnight, but we're in a strong position, and I'm excited about what's next. So thank you to everyone in our community, to all of our teams, all of our partners, and all of our shareholders for everything you're doing to help connect the world.
And now here's Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone.
We had a great first quarter and a strong start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.2 billion, up 75% year over year, and is now approximately 82% of total ad revenue. Our growth was strong across all verticals, marketer segments, and regions, particularly North America and APAC.
We remain focused on driving our clients' businesses, moving their products off shelves both in stores and online. A big focus for us in 2016 is helping our clients understand the true business impact of their ads, especially on digital. We're pleased with the progress we made in Q1 across our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Consumers have shifted to mobile, and businesses know they need to catch up. We hear from marketers that figuring out mobile today is like figuring out TV in its early days. But given where consumers spend their time, the question now is not if they should market on mobile, but how.
One of the drivers of the consumer shift to mobile is video. People are sharing and creating nearly three times more video on Facebook than they were a year ago. And as of February, the time people spend watching videos on Instagram increased by more than 40% over the preceding six months. This presents a big opportunity for marketers.
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently on mobile feed than on TV. They create ads that grab attention in the first few seconds, sometimes even without sound, what we now call thumb-stopping creative. For example, Nestlé took their TV ad for Natural Bliss coffee creamer and in less than a day edited it for mobile feed by creating a new opening and adding text overlays to relay their message without sound. They showed both the original TV ad and the mobile ad on Facebook. The original TV ad drove a four-point increase in ad recall. The mobile-optimized version, however, drove an even stronger 10-point increase in ad recall and a seven-point increase in product awareness.
We want to help marketers optimize their video ads. For example, we know that on average, captioned videos increase view time by 12%, so we introduced Auto Captions to generate captions for video ads. In Q1 we introduced new ad formats like Canvas ads. Canvas ads showcase products by combining video images and call-to-action buttons. While it's still early, we're pleased with the results and are seeing adoption across many verticals.
To motivate millennials to take on do-it-yourself projects, Lowe's and BBDO targeted 25 to 34-year-old homeowners with Canvas ads that let them see bathroom designs, discover the products in each design, and tap to purchase. The ads were so engaging that people spent an average of 28 seconds interacting with them, and Lowe's saw a 6.7 times return on AdSense.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. This quarter we announced that we have over 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and over 200,000 on Instagram. A significant number of these advertisers are small and medium businesses. These businesses use our platforms because it's easy and affordable for them to connect with their consumers on mobile. We're also making it easier for SMBs to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that our most sophisticated advertisers use. We're seeing even small businesses use products like Lead Ads, Slideshow, and Dynamic Product Ads.
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. Last year we introduced Conversion Lift to measure how Facebook and Instagram campaigns drive business objectives like sales. We've seen clients across verticals from retail to auto use Conversion Lift to measure and improve the return on their ad investments. Chase Bank used Conversion Lift to measure how effectively their Super Bowl ad drove credit card applications. They found that combining Facebook video ads with their TV ads drove 1.5 times more conversions than TV ads alone. In Q1 we expanded our Lift capabilities by testing Lift API, enabling more partners to measure the effectiveness of more of their campaigns.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our three priorities. Helping marketers make the shift to mobile will take time. We have a lot of hard work ahead, and we'll continue to invest. I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and congratulate our global team on the results of their hard work.
Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone.
We're off to a great start in 2016, led by the ongoing growth and engagement of our community and continued momentum in our ads business. In Q1 we generated $5.4 billion in total revenue and delivered over $1.8 billion in free cash flow.
Let's begin with our community metrics. In March, 1.09 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 16% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.65 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of March. Mobile continues to drive our growth. Over 1.5 billion people accessed Facebook for mobile devices in March, up 21% from last year.
Before diving into our quarterly financial results, I wanted to highlight that beginning this quarter, I will focus my prepared remarks on our GAAP results, and all financial metrics are GAAP unless otherwise noted. The primary difference between our GAAP non-GAAP metrics is stock-based compensation [SBC]. Stock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore we view it as a real expense to the business. We will continue to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics in our press release and earnings slides. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.
Q1 total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 52% or 58% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue in Q1 was $5.2 billion, up 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. This marked a slight decline from the 66% constant currency ad growth rate we experienced in Q4. In Q1 this year, we benefited from an additional day due to the leap year, which contributed approximately two percentage points to our year-over-year ad revenue growth rate.
North America and Asia-Pacific were our fastest-growing regions, with advertising revenue growth of 64% and 62% respectively. Europe and rest of world grew advertising revenue more slowly, at 49% and 35% respectively, with the latter particularly impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. Setting aside currency headwinds, all regions exceeded 50% constant currency ad revenue growth.
Mobile ad revenue was $4.2 billion, representing approximately 82% of total ad revenue. Mobile ad revenue grew 75%, driven by strength from Facebook's News Feed. Our mobile ads business continues to be driven by the combination of both supply-side and demand-side factors. On the supply side, we continue to see healthy growth in the number of people using Facebook, time spent across our products, and ad loads. On the demand side, we believe the investments we have made to improve our mobile advertising solutions are helping drive value for both people and marketers. We are seeing growth in both new customers as well as existing customers who are spending more with us on average compared to last year.
In Q1, the average price per ad increased 5%, while total ad impressions increased 50%. The reported increase in price is being driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile, which contains higher priced News Feed ads rather than the mix we have on PCs of both News Feed ads and lower-priced right-hand column ads. The increase in impressions was driven by strong growth in mobile ad impressions and was offset partially by a decline in ad impressions delivered on personal computers, consistent with the ongoing declines in PC image.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $181 million, down 20% compared to last year. This decline was mainly driven by a reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Q1 total costs and expenses were $3.4 billion, up 29%. We ended the quarter with approximately 13,600 employees, up 35% compared to last year. Q1 operating income was $2 billion, representing a 37% operating margin. Our Q1 tax rate was 27%, down from our full-year 2015 tax rate of 40%. Our Q1 net income was approximately $1.5 billion, or $0.52 per-share.
In Q1, capital expenditures were $1.1 billion, more than double compared to Q1 of last year. Server purchases and data center construction were the largest contributors to year-over-year growth. New builds in Texas and Ireland along with the expansion of existing facilities will nearly double our current data center footprint when completed. In addition to servers and data centers, investments in office facilities also contributed to the year-over-year growth. We ended the quarter with $20.6 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook, first, some color on revenue. We remain focused on creating value for the people and marketers who use our services. We expect that the main drivers of advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, but we will face tougher comparables as the year progresses given the accelerating ad revenue growth we experienced throughout 2015. Payments and other fees revenues will continue to face headwinds throughout the year, given that the substantial majority of that revenue relates to payments from games played on personal computers. Even with the expected contribution from Oculus, we anticipate that our payments and other fees revenue for the full year 2016 will come in lower than the level in 2015.
Next on to the expense outlook; our expense guidance remains unchanged. We expect that full-year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 40%. We expect full-year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million, and full-year 2016 stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion.
If you take into account our GAAP expense guidance as well as our amortization and SBC guidance, you will see that our full-year 2016 total non-GAAP expense growth guidance range remains unchanged at 45% to 55%. We anticipate full-year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the high end of the $4 billion to $4.5 billion range we gave last quarter, as we invest to support the rapid growth of the business. We expect our Q2 and full-year 2016 tax rates to be similar to our Q1 rate.
In summary, 2016 is off to a great start for Facebook. Our results reflect healthy growth and engagement in our community, strength in our ads business, and investments we're making to capitalize on the long-term opportunities we see ahead.
Before going to questions, I wanted to touch briefly on the share reclassification that Mark discussed at the beginning of the call. As we disclosed in the proxy statement we filed today, our Board of Directors has approved a proposal for the reclassification of our capital stock that would involve the creation of a new class of publicly listed non-voting Class C capital stock. Pending stockholder approval, we intend to issue two Class C shares as a one-time stock dividend for each outstanding Class A and Class B share, resulting in a tripling of the pre-reclassification total shares outstanding. All stockholders would be treated equally.
The net effect of this transaction would be to establish two publicly traded classes of Facebook stock, one representing the current Class A shares and the other representing the non-voting Class C shares. Since the Class C shares would have the same economic rights as the Class A and Class B shares, we would expect that after the payment of the stock dividend, the share price of the Class A common stock would generally reflect a three-for-one stock split. This will have no effect on the voting interest related to shares that investors currently hold.
As Mark mentioned, this structure will allow for the preservation of the voting structure that has served the company well to date while allowing for Mark to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative over the course of his lifetime. Importantly, as part of this proposal, the preservation of the multi-class capital structure would be generally predicated on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook.
Let me talk about next steps. The reclassification would be conditioned on approval by a majority of outstanding votes held by company stockholders, and we anticipate a vote on the matter at our annual meeting to be held on June 20 this year. A record date for this dividend would be determined at a later date.
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you so much. I wanted to come back to your comments on the small and medium-sized business opportunity at Facebook, maybe direct a few points to Sheryl to get some comment. I wanted to understand what some of the opportunities are to continue to demonstrate to those advertisers what the potential is for both Facebook and maybe even Instagram and Facebook Messenger long term as platforms to grow their businesses and also pointing out what some of the measurement tools and operating challenges are to bring people onto the platform. Thank you.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Thank you for the question. SMBs, or SMUs as they're called in different places around the world, we think are a very core competitive advantage for us. It's prohibitively expensive for most small businesses to reach people digitally. Thirty-five percent of small businesses in the United States, which is often the most advanced market, don't have a web presence at all. And setting up a mobile app, getting people to find and download a mobile app, can be even more expensive.
And so what's happening is that SMBs are turning to Facebook pages as their mobile solution. They're free, they're easy to set up, and they already know how to do them because almost all of them are already Facebook users in the first place. And so the onboarding has been incredibly important and incredibly effective. We announced last year that we have over 50 million small business pages active on a monthly basis. Eighty percent of those are active on mobile. We then work on helping them use our ad products and upsell them to our paid ad products as well, and we announced this quarter that we hit 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and 200,000 on Instagram.
What's interesting is that what you see is SMBs are able to use the pull of some of the biggest brands in the world. So over 2 million SMBs have posted a video, both paid and organic, in the last month. And that happens to be many times the number of SMBs that have shot or placed a TV commercial.
In terms of measurement, your question is important because it's not just getting them to use our platforms to connect to consumers. It's getting them to be able to measure our results. And so we've worked hard to build measurement tools into the products, so that when you buy an ad, an SMB has a very easy interface and decide what their goals are. Are their goals measuring sales? Are their goals clicks to their website? Are their goals mobile app downloads? And then measuring all the way through from sharing that ad to the purchase.
I continue and we continue to be very bullish on this channel because we have such a broad base of usage, because that usage is so active, and because we're very focused on investing in simplifying our products so that all SMBs can use them.

Your next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Sheryl, you talked about video and increasing the overall video consumption. Can you talk about where you are on traction with video advertising and the adoption of video ad units and the impact of video in the quarter?
And then secondly, just breaking down the advertising by cohort, could you talk to points of strength or weakness across direct response versus branded advertisers in the quarter? Thanks.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Sure, I'll take the second one first. Our growth was really broad-based, and we grew across all of our marketer segments this quarter. That's direct response, brands, SMBs, and developers.
Our direct response business continues to be very strong. It's very ROI-focused, and we continue to invest and roll out products that help people. So for example, Lead Ads, where people can fill out forms on a mobile device, take their contact info from Facebook, we've rolled that out fully this quarter. And that enables people to use Facebook in a very direct to response way, and we'll continue to invest there.
Video ads are really exciting. It's worth noting that video ads take place on another avenue, and receipts are not all of the revenue incrementals (28:55). But as consumer engagement with video has continued to grow, that creates more and more of an opportunity for video ads. Marketers have always loved video because it's a really compelling way to reach people. And now we can reach them on mobile all day with those kind of messages.
Importantly, marketers have to adjust sometimes. While the 30-second ad does perform well in News Feed, we also see people understanding that some of the formats are different. Creating shorter ads, creating ads that can work even without sound, more personal ads has really mattered.
One example is Toyota used Facebook for the launch of the RAV4 Hybrid with Saatchi in Los Angeles. They used a very broad video to drive brand awareness. They reached over 36 million people in a target demo within three days. Then, and this is where it gets even more interesting, they retargeted people who watched the video with over 500 personalized video ads which were optimized for Facebook and Instagram. So they were creating a direct response campaign to get people to take specific actions like requesting a quote and finding a specific dealer. We saw a 14-point lift in ad recall, a seven-point lift in message association. And right now, we're using the Lift tool to continue to measure their sales for the 30 and 60 days beyond the campaign to see what happens. And we're pretty excited about what that shows in terms of how video can be used in a really broad-based way but also a more personal way.

Your next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. I have a couple for Mark around Messenger. Mark, I was hoping you could talk to us about how you expect to shift user behavior within Messenger to get users to focus more on businesses versus more personal communications and how you'll make users aware of the capabilities within the platform.
And then just secondly, as more bots come on board here and businesses are engaging with Messenger, how do you envision bots and humans working together in terms of providing more customer service? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. So part of our playbook for building out these ecosystems at scale is we start with the person-to-person user base. So whether that's in messaging, it's people messaging their friends or groups and News Feed. Before that, it was people posting updates and seeing what was going on with their friends and the people that they care about.
And then the next step is to create organic activity around public entities, so whether that's businesses, public figures like athletes and celebrities and types of folks that people want to interact with on these different platforms, and we did that on Facebook in News Feed group pages, and we're working on a number of different ways to do that in Messenger. One of those is bots. And one of the good things about bots that we've seen is that it can decrease the amount of time that you have to wait before you get a reply back from interacting with a message.
So what we've seen – we've done some research on this. A lot of people every day in Facebook today are already messaging pages and businesses directly, and the businesses respond. But what we've actually also found is that through some of our AI research, we can look at the responses that businesses give to common questions and can confidently provide the right reply a lot of the time. And when we can do that, then that decreases the latency. And predictably, people want to do more of that activity.
So that's one way that I think you're going to see bots work, between people who are actually driving the businesses directly will need to in some way train or answer questions for people, but we can build artificial intelligence that can learn from people how to automate a lot of that and make that experience a lot faster for people who want to interact with businesses and public figures. And of course then, after you start building out that segment of businesses and then public figures on the platform, then on top of that you have just a good amount of intent on these platforms to build a good business on top of that. That's stage three.

Your next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great, thank you, two questions. So Facebook just opened up Instant Articles globally to all publishers. I'm just wondering what you see as a publisher's benefit in joining Instant Articles. And how we should think about the monetization impact in 2016?
And then second question, the ad revenue in APAC was much better than we thought, just any more color on the drivers there. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So Instant Articles is all about the quality of the consumer experience. Right now for links that are not Instant Articles, it can be one of the slowest parts of the Facebook app. You're browsing through a News Feed, you tap on a link, if you're not on a good connection, the content isn't cached, it can take 10 or 20 seconds in some cases for that content to load. And people in our community, they don't know the difference about whether that content is coming from Facebook or a different place. They hold us accountable for making their experience quick, and we want to do everything we can to do that.
So Instant Articles makes it so that any publisher around the world now can deliver a really great native experience instantly with no latency in loading it. And we're just seeing that people like to engage with that a lot more. So that's where we're most excited about there.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
The APAC question, it has been growing really well for several quarters now, and we're seeing a lot of great adoption as people learn to use the products. One part of the business that I think has been really strong and is worth noting is we're working with marketers in China to help with their export business. So Air China is a good example. They're a popular airline in China, but they don't really have – they're not really as well-known overseas. And before working with us, they really only invested in traditional media.
They had a goal of promoting their new flight routes, including one from Mumbai to Beijing, and their new aircraft. So they launched a campaign with us in 15 countries globally. They used reach and frequency and Carousel and video ad targeting. And for example, they would target in the U.S. age 18 and above frequent international travelers living in cities where they had routes or Indian expats living in the U.S. to promote new routes to Mumbai. They reached 30 million people globally, more than 95% on mobile. And here's the best part, they had a 73% sales lift in the United States. So our APAC business is robust, and I think the global nature of our business is part of driving that.

The next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thank you. I was just wondering if you could share with us. How do you see Instagram's ramp impacting Facebook's ad growth in 2016, or if there's any color you could share with us about how that's been ramping? And also, if you can, share with us how advertisers are viewing the platform. Are you finding that it's typically more additive to their Facebook spending, or are they funding it with existing Facebook budgets? Thank you.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad platforms out there. In the short run, some of the spend is incremental and some isn't. There are people who will have a social budget or a digital budget. And as they move to Instagram, some of that will come from Facebook. In the medium to long run, we believe we compare very favorably with any other spend we can do because we have this very broad reach on both platforms plus the ability to target very specifically. So what you're seeing in our results right now are very strong growth for Facebook and very strong growth for Instagram. We hit 3 million advertisers for Facebook. We hit 200,000 for Instagram, and often the platforms really work together.

The next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks, a question for Mark. There have been some concerns about traffic to publishers and sharing levels on Facebook. I just wondered if you could talk about core Facebook engagement. What's really working? Are you concerned at all about that? And then when you think about the ad loads, are you comfortable with where they're at, is there still a lot of room to go? And then maybe last one, if you were to ever leave Facebook, what would happen to your voting shares? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
All right, let's talk about engagement first. So overall sharing is up across Facebook, and people are spending more time on Facebook and the whole family of apps. And that is not just the case for the aggregate of the growing community, but it's actually also the case on a per-person basis as well in terms of people sharing more and spending more time individually.
Now one of the things that we see is that the way that we are sharing is always changing, and some of this is because of underlying technical transition. So on desktop, for example, it's easier to type, so we saw more text posts. On mobile, it's easier to take videos, so we see more videos. On desktop, people would have more commonly uploaded an album of photos that they took from their digital camera and downloaded onto their computer; whereas on mobile, the more common behavior is to take a single photo or a couple and just post those. So there are all these transitions. And that's our job, is to make it so that we build great tools that people – everyone around the world can share anything that they want with everyone.
Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of different kinds of audiences. So Facebook gives you the ability to share with all of your friends and publicly if you want and with groups. But we're also investing in things like Messenger and WhatsApp because a lot of people want to share increasingly messages privately one on one or with very small groups. So in addition to Messenger, which is at 900 million people a month, and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month, Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with.
But ultimately, I think that humans have such a deep desire to express themselves and want to connect with the people around them that I think that all of these audiences and all of these different types of media should grow over time. And it's our job to basically make sure that we build good products and get rid of all the bugs and make it so the performance is fast, and all the basic stuff works, that way we get there. But in general, right now all the high-level trends look pretty positive on that.
I think I'll kick it off to Dave to go through your questions about some of the technical pieces about the reclassification.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. I guess, also, Justin, you had a question on ad load, so I'll do both the ad load and the question on the reclassification. So on ad load, it's definitely up from where we were couple of years ago. I think it's really worth emphasizing that what has enabled us to do that is just improving the quality and the relevance of the ads that we have, and that's enabled us to show more of them without harming the user experience at all. So that's been really key. Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunities to continue to grow supply through the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook as well as on our other apps such as Instagram.
On the question regarding what would happen to Mark's shares if he were to leave Facebook, I'd just refer that the new multi-class capital structure is generally dependent on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook. And if you go into the proxy materials, it goes into more detail on how different things would play out under various other scenarios. So I would just refer you to those.

Your next question is from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Mark, when you're thinking about acquisitions broadly, in what area do you think Facebook needs to buy versus build? Basically, where you need external help?
And then on VR, just a few quick questions, any update on the shipping delay, how many units shipped in the quarter and expectations for the year? And then also on VR, understanding I know it's very, very early, but beyond games and entertainment, what verticals do you expect to be first to utilize VR and AR? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So on the acquisition philosophy, I've talked about how I think the social ecosystem will play out on a number of these calls. The basic theory that we have is that there are a small number of services that are going to be ubiquitous utilities that 1 billion or 2 billion or more people are going to want to use. So that's core basic messaging, the core functionality around having your real identity and connecting with all of your real friends and family online. Those are things that we just think are just going to be ubiquitous. So we want to build those.
At the same time, we also think that there are going to be many, many good businesses and different other social use cases where there are people doing good work and building different companies that we feel no need to own those things. So I think that people come up from time to time and suggest, should we buy this company or that. And what we look at are what are the things that we think are going to be ubiquitous tools, and who are the most talented people in the world to build this. And so when you think about something like virtual and augmented reality, that's how we thought about that.
Those are going to be important platforms over time. It's very early obviously. It's going to take a long time to get there. And a lot of what we felt like we were buying there was a critical mass of the best people and the best technology to go do all the things that we needed to go do over the next 10 years to drive that home and turn that into a big platform.
You asked a question about virtual and augmented reality. What are going to be the big use cases? For the first few years of virtual reality, I think gaming and video are going to be the big ones. The initial market that we look at are all the people who have Xboxes, PlayStations, and Wiis, the people who are excited to have an immersive media experience sitting in their living room for a long period of time, and that's a pretty big market. Even though that's not all of what we hope to eventually serve and that's not the full potential of these new platforms, I think that is one case where you can obviously deliver better and richer experiences than you can with the current generation of technology.
Video is going really well. I shared a stat before in some of my comments that on Gear VR alone, we are now at more than 2 million hours of video have been watched on the platform, so that's really exciting. And that of course will be bolstered by the fact that these new 360 videos can not only be watched in VR, so in the headsets, but we're building tools so you can share them on News Feed and through our products elsewhere as well. So I think that's exciting. Over time there will be even more, but that I think should be enough to have some initial use. But again, I do want to really emphasize, this is early and it's going take a long time. And I know there's a lot of hype around this, and we're just focused on building this to be very good over the long term.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Then, Ben, you asked about shipping units. We did begin shipping units in the quarter. This is very small still. VR is still very early. It's not going to have a material impact on revenue in 2016, and I gave more color on that in my prepared remarks.

Your next question is from Mark May with Citi. Your line is open.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks a lot, first one for Sheryl, I think. I'm wondering if you could update us on the progress you're seeing with FAN [Facebook Audience Network]. You gave some metrics in Q4. It seemed like that advertisers were really adopting that platform and seeing a lot of additional reach. Maybe if you could, tell us how that's going.
And then I think a couple more; on the tax rate, we saw it step down quite a bit in Q1, but you're guiding for flat sequentially. Should we think about that as a run rate, or are you still attempting to manage your tax rate down even further than where you saw it in Q1 and where you're expecting for Q2?
And then on the OpEx guide, 41% non-GAAP growth in Q1, obviously below your range but you maintained the range. Why is that? Is that just purely a function of the comps as you head into the year, or are there some specific investment plans that you have? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Mark. I can start with the detailed ones, the tax rate and the OpEx guide. So on the tax rate, the rate came in better than guidance in terms of the tax rate, but it's consistent with the long-term trend that I'd indicated. We do expect that that rate will be approximately the rate that will continue for the rest of the year. So for purposes of 2016 modeling, I would use the Q1 rate.
On the OpEx guide, Q1 came in slightly below our annual expense growth guidance, but we do expect that investments in areas like video and Oculus will impact the remainder of the year more substantially, so that's why we're maintaining the annual OpEx growth guidance that we have. And then, Sheryl, did you want to speak about Audience Network?
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Yes, Audience Network is important to us because we're making a strategic investment in ad tech, helping advertisers and publishers grow, so it's on and off Facebook. We think we're uniquely placed to bring people-based marketing to scale and solve the measurement problem, and the Audience Network is a place we're really focused because we feel like we're delivering value for advertisers and publishers, so we're investing behind the growth we've seen. We've seen a growth of native ads. Eighty-three percent of the overall inventory on the platform is native, and over 50% of our publishers are only using native ads.
We have some great examples of Audience Networks really improving people's results. A recent one is eBay Vivanuncios, which is an online real estate destination working in Latin America and Mexico. When they were using a combination of Facebook, Instagram, and the Audience Network, they saw 57% lower cost per install with placement optimization and 59% more volume versus running on Facebook alone, which led to 6% incremental revenue. So compared to November a year before, the number of their app installs increased by 115%.
So what we're seeing is the results we're able to deliver on Facebook and Instagram, a lot of our marketing partners want more. And our ability to do that is why we're investing in the Audience Network.

The next question is from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Benjamin C. Gaither - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi, this is actually Ben on for Colin. This one is for Mark. You had already talked about the AI and machine learning applications with respect to Messenger and bots, but I was wondering what are some of the more nascent initiatives where you're applying machine learning, or maybe where we might see those investments manifest themselves in the user experience over the next few years?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So the biggest thing that we're focused on with artificial intelligence is building computer services that have better perception than people, so the basic human senses like seeing, hearing, language, core things that we do. I think it's possible to get to the point in the next five to 10 years where we have computer systems that are better than people at each of those things. That doesn't mean that the computers will be thinking or be generally better, but that is useful for a number of things.
So for example, I talked about earlier, we are building this Moments app, so that way you can take photos on your phone. And if you use this app, our face recognition can look at the photos that you take and suggest that you might want to share photos that you took with a friend in them with that person. So that way, all the photos that might be of you and your friends' camera rolls, they can share with you. Another example is just spam filtering and just making sure that we can actually read the content and understand what's interesting to you or not and not show that.
One obvious thing I think over time is if you just look at the way that we rank News Feed, today we use some basic signals like who you're friends with and what pages you like as some of the most important things for figuring out what – out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content that are on Facebook, what we're going to show and what are going to be the most interesting things to you. That's because today our systems can't actually understand what the content means. We don't actually look at the photo and deeply understand what's in it or look at the videos and understand what's in it or read the links that people share and understand what's in them, but in the future we'll be able to, I think in a five or 10-year period.
So all of these millions and millions of pieces content that are out there, whether or not you've added someone as a friend or have liked a page, we'll be able to know a lot better what types of things are going to be interesting to you to produce a much better feed of content. So that's just a basic example of where having human-level perception broadly is going to yield better experiences in a lot of the things that people care about today.

The next question is from Ken Sena with Evercore. Your line is open.
Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI
Hi. I have a high-level, longer-term question. For brands, we're seeing where promotion, transaction, and support capabilities for businesses are all deepening within Facebook. Therefore, should we be thinking about a longer-term transition from a platform that's basically all ad to something where more marketplace capability is offered, given that buyers and sellers are so known and so connected? And if so, can we think about Facebook starting to monetize maybe on a transaction basis or even through various customer support capabilities via the messaging tools, AI, et cetera, that you're beginning to offer businesses? So maybe if you could just provide a little bit of color on how you see that evolution, that would be great. Thank you.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
You're right that people are increasingly using Facebook to discover products and services, and we're testing some ways like the Marketplace to make this easier. We're also testing some incremental features on pages, which enable businesses to drive purchases on a page or direct people directly to their website. These are really early, but we've had some positive feedback.
Our focus, however, continues to be on our ad products because we think we can take people all the way from the top of the funnel, where they can really get a brand awareness or product awareness, and go all the way down to purchase, not necessarily because the purchase is happening on Facebook, but because we can work on the measurement systems to understand how the advertising, both at the top and lower down in the funnel is influencing those purchases.
We've been really excited by what we've seen in the commerce vertical of our ad products. So products like dynamic product ads, Carousel ads are working really well for us. This quarter we launched Canvas ads, which are very fast-loading, immersive mobile ads. They're easy to build. You can use the self-service tool. You don't have to write any code. They are native format, so they decrease that initial drop-off you see when people click off to another site. It's very early days, but the average viewing time is over 30 seconds, which shows how immersive that is.
I'll share one example of how ads are driving a small business on Facebook through ads, which is a company called Sparkle in Pink. They're a Utah-based SMB. They're selling girls' clothing. They did a Slideshow ad that included a Shop Now button, which enables you to take action on their site. They were able to increase sales by 9% a month. And more exciting for us, this was six times more efficient in terms of acquisition than any other digital media channel. And that shows how you can use our ad products to go all the way from awareness, measuring through to a sale and show how important our ads can be to commerce on our platform.
Operator
Your next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, so I guess a question for Mark or Sheryl. So at F8, you showcased a bunch of new features for Messenger, including ads to promote your business inside of Messenger. So how should we think about the timing of those ad units coming on in Messenger? And can you use the same ad stack in the Facebook Power Editor that's used on core Facebook and Instagram to get ads up on Messenger? Can you walk us through that?
And then the second question on messaging, so with WhatsApp crossing 1 billion users recently, how do you view the product roadmap today on WhatsApp versus what you showcased recently with Messenger? Is it a year behind, or is it further back than that? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
For Messenger and WhatsApp, our focus right now continues to be on growth and engagement. We are not rolling out any monetization products on WhatsApp right now, but we did start that process at F8 on Messenger. And what we're doing is following the organic activity that's happening on the Messenger platform. Businesses and consumers are using Messenger to connect to each other in a more personal, more immediate way. And we rolled out a platform beta, which gives new opportunities to build compelling experiences. Bots, very early but giving the opportunity for more personal interactions between businesses and mobile. The 10 received APIs (56:26), so that businesses could send immediate responses to common questions, including engaging images and call to action as well as texts.
In terms of the timing, this is really early. We have a lot of opportunity to invest in advertising across our different platforms. And so we want to make sure we get this right as we focus on continued engagement. You're right that over time, when we make these investments, we are going to be able to rely on some of the core aspects of the ads infrastructure. Certainly, our long base of advertisers, some of the things we understand about how ads perform and the functionality will be an important part of the product offerings in the future, but those are not immediate by any stretch of the imagination.

Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Your last question is from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Thanks a lot. I have one for Sheryl and one for Mark. Sheryl, there are many out there who might assume that this leg of excellent growth that Facebook is realizing might have come at the expense of TV advertising, but the TV ad world seems to be quite resilient here. And you actually talked a lot in your prepared remarks about how marketers benefit from running digital and TV campaigns in parallel. So I wonder if you could just comment on where your share gains are coming from, in your view.
And then, Mark, on Live video, I realize it's a small part of overall video, but I wonder. Do you think multiple platforms can succeed in live streaming over time given the size of the market longer term, or do you think it's more of a network effect business where a vast majority of the traffic and economics will ultimately accrue to the leader in the live streaming space? Thank you.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
We think our growth has been very broad-based, but dollars are shifting from all types of media formats to where consumers are spending their time. We tell our clients that we want to be the best dollar and the best minute they spend, and we want them to measure value. I don't think this means that all of our growth comes at the expense of any one channel, but it's broad-based. And often, TV and Facebook and Instagram can work really well together.
I'll give a fun example from the Super Bowl. T-Mobile wanted to use their Super Bowl campaign to increase their brand awareness and increase their reach. So before the game, they targeted their 30-second Super Bowl ad that featured Drake to people with NFL and celebrity interests. It performed so well that they decided to run the 60-second version on Facebook and Instagram. That ad was so successful on Facebook and Instagram that they then ran the 60-second ad on TV instead of their 30-second ad. So as people invest, they can use these different platforms together, and we're pretty excited to see that progress.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And on Live video, the theme that I think is most important is just that there's so much that people want to express and share with the people around them that they don't have the tools to do today. And I think about this huge opportunity, not just in Live video, but in a lot of things that we're talking about.
One interesting example recently that I touched on earlier is between Messenger and WhatsApp, we're around 60 billion messages a day. And SMS at its peak we think was around 20 billion messages a day. And just unlocking some of the friction that existed in SMS and improving the product a little bit and removing the small fee that was there has just unlocked a huge amount of expression. And we think that this is going to be the case in all different types of media and with all different audiences that a person would share it with.
So in video, there are billions and billions of videos that are viewed every day on Facebook. Live is a very small part of it. The reason why we give disproportionate attention to it is because we're trying to help push forward new formats that are not just about consuming content but are really about interacting, so Live, 360 video, and there will be others in the future.
And so yes, to answer your question, I do think that multiple products and companies can succeed in building these things. I also think that there are going to be a lot more interactive forms of video than just Live and 360 like we're talking about now. And I think that this extends not just to video but for all the different types of media and audiences that we're serving. So we're very excited about continuing to do our work to help unlock all the expression and connection that people want to do.

Good afternoon. My name is Chris and I’ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to the Facebook Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much.
Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook’s Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.
Deborah Crawford
Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook’s fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today’s press release, our annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we may present, both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.
And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Overall Q4 was a strong quarter and a great end to the year. More than 1.59 billion people now use Facebook each month and 1.04 billion every day, a growth of nearly 200 million people monthly and a 148 million people daily this year. More than 1.44 billion people use Facebook on mobile devices.
And when it comes to our business, we’re also pleased with our continued growth. Total revenue grew by 52% year-over-year to more than $5.8 billion and advertising revenue grew by 57% to reach more than $5.6 billion.
But it’s important to consider not just our business results but also how we’re improving the lives of people and communities around the world. Next week Facebook celebrates its 12th birthday. And as I think about our progress and where we go from here, I’ve reflected on the diverse global moments that Facebook was involved in, in 2015. More than 950 million people received a notification that a friend or a loved one was safe in a crisis. Millions of people supported the people of Nepal after the earthquake and the people of France after the Paris attacks. More than 8 million people used 35,000 groups and pages on Facebook to support refugees. And people from all over the world connected around moments from Star Wars to the U.S. presidential election, from the Indian Super League to the Cricket World Cup.
Seeing our global community connecting in all these ways shows the opportunities ahead as we connect the world but also the challenges. Even as the world has tended towards greater openness over time, in many communities we also see greater fear over what a connected world and more technological progress means for them. Addressing these concerns is essential for making progress on our mission. And we’re going to keep working to give as much voice as we can and advance the benefits of connectivity and bringing the world together. In 2016 and beyond, we’re going to continue doing that by serving our community, working to bring connectivity to billions of people who’re not yet connected, and building new technologies that give people more ways to express themselves.
Now, let’s talk about how we’ve continued working to do that and let’s start with how we’re improving our existing products and businesses. Our strategy here is to deliver better more engaging experiences for our community and to give people better tools for sharing different types of content with the different groups of people that they care about. Video is an important part of the Facebook experience, and continuing to invest here is important for allowing people to share and consume some of the most engaging content. We’ve continued to make progress and now 100 million hours of video are watched daily on Facebook. We’ve been testing new experiences like suggested videos which enables people to discover more videos they might be interested in. We’re also exploring ways to give people a dedicated place on Facebook for when they just want to watch videos.
With other parts of our core, we’ve continued to focus on improving the performance and quality of our products to better serve different communities on Facebook. And these efforts are paying off with growth in engagement for different products reaching an impressive scale. Now, more than 500 million people use events each month and more than a 123 million events were created on Facebook in 2015. For the first time, more than 1 billion people used groups in a single month on Facebook. It’s inspiring to see all the different communities using groups, from the small family and classroom and church groups to the large ones like the running challenge group that I started a few weeks ago that now has about a 100,000 members.
To serve our entire global community, we’re optimizing our services for people in developing countries. We’ve improved Facebook Lite to offer better experience in low-bandwidth environments, improving load times and adding features like video. More than 80 million people now use Facebook Lite as of December.
And when it comes to serving businesses, we’ve continued to focus on creating better ads and tools for our more than 2.5 million active advertisers. More than 50 million small businesses now use pages on Facebook and people post more than 2.5 billion comments on these pages each month. This is a good example of how the strength and engagement of our community is making Facebook more valuable for businesses every day. And Sheryl is going to talk more about this in a minute.
Next, let’s talk about how we’re building our next generation of services. With Instagram, we’ve continued to drive the shift towards more visual content online. The community continues to grow. And back in September, we announced a new milestone of 400 million monthly actives. Over the last year, as the community has grown, we have focused on building engaging new experiences for the community including by improving search and by introducing Trending Content. We’ve also worked to develop new experiences to give people more options for creating and sharing different types of content. In March, we launched the layout app allowing people to easily combine images and in October the team also launched Boomerang, and app for making looping videos which reached number one in the App Store in more than 70 countries.
We also introduced a new video channel on Instagram for people to watch moments from big events like New Year, so the college football championship as they have it. With Messenger and WhatsApp, we’ve continued to make progress with building these into valuable communication services for everyone in the world. More than 800 million people now use Messenger monthly and in 2015 we grew that number by almost a quarter of 1 billion while also increasing engagement. We continue to give people new ways to communicate by introducing video calling and new options for customizing conversations with fun things like colors and emojis and by using apps like -- using apps, the Messenger platform.
We also worked to extend Messenger’s utility by adding payments, a new way to connect with businesses and by testing M, a digital assistant powered by AI. In this quarter we also began testing a transportation platform, allowing people to request an Uber ride through Messenger. More services will be coming to the platform soon, including airlines.
WhatsApp ended the year with nearly 1 billion monthly actives. As WhatsApp has grown, we work to keep it fast, simple and reliable. And we’ve seen many communities come to depend on this as their main communication service. To serve these communities well, this month we announced that WhatsApp will now be free to everyone and will no longer charge the subscription fees that many people were charged after their first year. We think this is an important step towards creating and even more ubiquitous product without affecting our plans for building WhatsApp into important business in the coming years. Later this year, we’ll be testing new ways for people to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that they want to hear from.
Finally, let’s talk about our work on new breakthrough technologies that can help connect more people to the internet and create transformative new experiences. In 2015, we made significant progress on our efforts to connect more people to the internet. We launched the first trials of Express WiFi, a product designed to help entrepreneurs bring their communities online. We launched Free Basics in 33 more countries, and we’ve now connected 19 million people. This year, we expect to hold our first test flight of Aquila, our first solar-powered aircraft designed to beam internet into communities from the sky. And we’re also working on new advances in lasers that can transfer large amounts of data faster and more efficiently than anything today.
With our work in AI, we continue to make progress towards the new generation of computers that can see and understand. Over the last year, we published dozens of research papers including some of the leading work on image recognition and language understanding. To drive the entire AI community forward, we’ve also open-sourced software and a lot of new AI hardware platform.
Achieving the scientific breakthroughs to build AI that makes a dramatic visible difference in people’s lives is going to take a long time. But already we’re seeing opportunities to serve our community. We recently built a prototype AI system that combines language and vision comprehension. You can show it an image that it’s never seen before and it can answer questions about that image. And we’ve even used AI to help blind people experience their friends’ photos and news feed by describing the scenes.
With virtual reality, we’ve reached an important milestone. The Samsung Gear VR shipped over the holidays with our Oculus software and we’re pleased with the initial reaction. This month, we also opened pre-orders for Oculus headsets. This will be the world’s best VR experience and we’re excited to begin shipping to people in more than 20 countries before the end of March. More than 100 VR games and experiences are coming to Oculus this year. And later this year, we’ll also be shipping our Oculus Touch controllers to get your hands into virtual reality.
These controllers will enhance the VR experience and allow people to communicate more naturally in VR through intuitive hand movements and gestures. This Oculus launch is shaping up to be a big moment for the gaming community. But over the long-term, VR has the potential to change the way that we live, work and communicate as well. The launch is an important step towards the future, and we’re really looking forward to seeing how people use it.
So that’s how we’ve continued to make progress on our strategy. It’s been a strong quarter and we ended 2015 with a great foundation for our efforts going into 2016. Our strategy is working and we have many more opportunities ahead. So, we’re going to continue investing to deliver more great results over the long-term.
On a more personal note, over the last few months with the new addition in my family, I’ve been reflecting a lot on the legacy that we want to pass on to the next generation. I’m excited about our progress and the chance to build something great for the future. If we continue to focus on solving the fundamental challenges facing the world and bringing the world closer together, we can leave a better world for the whole next generation. And that’s what I think about every day as we continue building Facebook. And I want to thank everyone in our community, our employees, our shareholders and our partners who are helping us on this journey. Thanks. And here’s Sheryl.
Sheryl Sandberg
Thanks, Mark, and hi everyone. We had a terrific fourth quarter capping off a great 2015. Q4 ad revenue grew 57% or 66% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.5 billion, up 81% year-over-year and is now 80% of total ad revenue. Facebook and Instagram drive business results for our partners, helping their products off shelves online and off. As a result, we’re growing spend from our current clients and attracting new marketers to our platform.
We saw strong growth across all verticals, marketer segments and regions. We’re also pleased with the growth we’re seeing in emerging markets and countries like China where businesses are advertising on Facebook and Instagram to reach people internationally. We continue to make progress on our three priorities, capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Heading into 2016, it is clear that consumers have shifted to mobile and businesses know they need to catch up. Marketers now realize that if they want to reach their customers where they are, mobile is essential. Our conversations with clients have shifted from if they should market and mobile to how. With over 1.44 billion people using Facebook on mobile monthly and over 400 million monthly actives on Instagram, Facebook and Instagram have become the two most important mobile advertising platforms.
We provide creative canvas powered by technology, a unique combination of art and science that marketers can use to deliver great creative with the highest quality targeting at unparalleled scale. The 2015 holiday season was a defining moment for mobile marketing and demonstrated the power of our mobile platform.
According to comScore, total U.S. consumer spending on mobile in November and December was up 59% year-over-year. This holiday season, marketers turned to mobile more than ever before. To reach a large global audience for the launch of Halo 5, Microsoft Xbox used optimized for Facebook and Instagram. Working with our agencies and power media team from Dentsu Aegs Network, Eisenberg Group and twofifteenmccann, they understood that people watch video differently in mobile newsfeed than on TV. So they created videos to capture audience attention in the first three seconds even without sound. They drove over 380 million impressions and 49 million video views in key markets and increased purchases by 10 points in the U.S.
Our second priority is growing a number marketers using our ad products. Last quarter we announced that we had over 2.5 million active advertisers and since then our growth has remained strong. This represents small fraction of the over 50 million small businesses now actively using pages. So we see a big opportunity to continue to grow the number of Facebook advertisers going forward. We’re also very pleased with the growth in advertiser adoption of Instagram and the positive results advertisers are seeing from their investments. 98 of the top 100 advertisers on Facebook also advertised on Instagram in Q4.
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. We shipped a lot of new ad products this past year. These products help deliver personalized marketing at scale and drive business for our clients. Leading up to Black Friday Shop Direct, the UK’s second largest online retailer teased upcoming sales with a cinemagraph video to build awareness. They then retargeted people who saw the video with one day only deals. On Black Friday, they used our carousel and DPA ads to promote products people had shown interest in. They saw 20 times return on ad spend from this campaign, helping them achieve their biggest Black Friday and their most successful sales day ever.
To share just a few other product examples, in emerging markets we launched Slideshow a video like ad experience that works with lower connection speeds and feature phones. We introduced local awareness ads globally to help brick and mortar businesses reach people near their stores and started testing Canvas ads to help marketers showcase their products in a more immersive way. We continue to invest in ad tech and are especially pleased with the growth of our audience network.
Measurement also remains a critical area of focus. Our measurement tools like Conversion Lift and the Facebook pixel prove to marketers that we’re driving business results and help make our ads more relevant. This year we saw more advertisers shift from proxy metrics like clicks to business results like digital and in store sales.
Our results show that the investments we’ve made over the past few years are paying off and we see a lot of exciting opportunities ahead. We know we still have a lot of hard work to do and heading into the New Year, we will remain very focused on our top three priorities.
I want to take this opportunity to thank our clients around the world for their partnership. Your investment and feedback is critical to making our products better. I also really want to thank the global Facebook teams for your extraordinary dedication to our partner success. Your hard work and execution is critical to helping us fulfill our mission. Thanks everyone and now here is Dave.
Dave Wehner
Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Q4 was a strong quarter and wrapped up a phenomenal year for Facebook. Full year 2015 revenue was $17.9 billion, up 44% year-over-year or 53% on a constant currency basis. In 2015, we generated over $6 billion in free cash flow including $2.1 billion in Q4 while continuing to fund important investments for the future growth of the business. The strong growth and engagement of our community with consistent theme throughout 2015, and that continued in the fourth quarter. In December, 1.04 billion people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represented 65% of the 1.59 billion people who visited Facebook during the month of December. Mobile continued to drive the growth of our community. In December, 1.44 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, an increase of 21% compared to last year and 90% of the people who have used Facebook on both a monthly and daily basis accessed us via mobile devices.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles. In Q4, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 52% or 60% on a constant currency basis. Q4 ad revenue was $5.6 billion, up over $2 billion from last year, year-over-year growth was 57% or 66% on a constant currency basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue in the fourth quarter. Had exchange rates remained constant with Q4 2014 levels, our total revenue would have been approximately $320 million higher. U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific continued to be our two strongest regions with ad revenue growth of 64% and 57% respectively. Our rest of world and Europe regions grew at 53% and 45% respectively, as they were more heavily impacted by currency headwinds.
Mobile ad revenue was $4.5 billion, up 81% from last year and represented 80% of our advertising revenue. For perspective, three years ago the mobile percentage was just over 20%. Q4 tapped off a remarkably successful year for our mobile advertising business where we were able to combine strong growth in ad inventory supply with strong growth in advertiser demand. On the supply side, we grew the number of people using Facebook on mobile, time spent, and ad load. Our ongoing focus on ad quality and relevance enabled us to deliver a better overall mobile ads experience for our users while increasing the number of ads they see. In Q4, we also benefitted to a lesser extent from increases in ad inventory from Instagram and the Audience Network.
On the demand side, we believe our efforts on targeting and measurement solution enabled marketers to achieve better business results at better values. This helped us drive strong growth from a broad array of advertisers including direct response in brand advertisers, large companies and SMBs and both existing and new advertisers.
Turning now to the overall price volume metrics, in Q4 the average price per ad increased 21% while total ad impressions increased 29% on a year-over-year basis. It’s worth noting that this was the first quarter since Q3 2013 that total ad impressions increased on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by an increase in mobile ad impressions and was partially offset by a decline in ad impressions that were heard on personal computers, consistent with the ongoing declines in PC usage. The reported increase in price is being driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile which contains higher price newsfeed ads rather than the mix we have on PCs of both newsfeed ads and lower price right-hand column ads. Total payments and other fees revenue was $204 million, down 21% compared to last year. The decline was driven by reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses, Q4 total GAAP expenses were $3.3 billion, up 21%, and non-GAAP expenses were $2.3 billion, up 42%. Our year-over-year GAAP expense growth rate slowed this quarter as we lap the introduction of stock-based compensation charges associated with the WhatsApp transaction. Non-GAAP expenses were driven by increases in head count related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. We ended the year with nearly 12,700 employees, up 38% compared to last year.
Our GAAP operating income was approximately $2.6 billion, representing a 44% operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion, representing a 60% operating margin. Our Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 39% and 36% respectively. Our Q4 GAAP net income was approximately $1.6 billion or $0.54 per share, and our non-GAAP net income was $2.3 billion or $0.79 per share. In the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $2.5 billion as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure, and office facilities to support the rapid growth of the business. We ended the year with over $18.4 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook, first some color on revenue. We expect the factors that drove the strong growth of our advertising business in 2015 will continue into 2016. However, we expect to continue to face foreign exchange headwinds especially early in the year as we will be lapping periods where the dollar was relatively weaker than it is today. More importantly -- sorry, more broadly, the overall macro-environment introduces the level of uncertainty around global growth and exchange rates that could impact our business in 2016. And we do expect to face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the remarkably strong advertising performance in 2015.
Turning now to expense guidance, 2016 will be another significant investment year for Facebook. In 2015, we continued investing heavily in the core. At the same time, we doubled our investment levels in our next generation services which includes WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger and we tripled our investment levels in our long-term areas of focus which includes our connectivity efforts, Oculus and our AI investments. We will continue investing significantly in all of these areas in 2016. We expect the year-over-year growth rate for full year 2016 total GAAP expenses to be approximately 30% to 40%, and for full year 2016 total non-GAAP expenses to be approximately 45% to 55%.
Note these ranges represent total operating expenses -- including cost of revenue. These ranges also include the cost of revenue impact of the expected shipments of Oculus Rift, so we expect that impact to be immaterial to our overall total expenses for the year. We anticipate our 2016 capital expenditures will be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. We recently announced that we will be -- begin building a new data center in Clonee, Ireland and that project is on top of the new data center being built in Fort Worth Texas. We expect our 2016 stock-based compensation to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million.
And lastly, we anticipate that our Q1 and full year 2016 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the low 30s on a percentage basis, down from our 2015 range. We expect our tax rates will decline further over time and resemble those for our global peers over the next several years. In addition in 2016, we expect for the first time to pay a significant amount of U.S. income tax on a cash basis.
To conclude, 2015 was an outstanding year for Facebook. Our performance reflects the strong growth and engagement of our community, the momentum we’re seeing in our ads business, and significant progress we’re making on our mission to connect the world.
With that Chris, we would like to open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And we will now open the line for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Douglas Anmuth
Thanks for taking my question. Two things I wanted to ask. First Mark, just on Messenger and WhatsApp, can you just talk more about the takeaway on the Messenger platform now that it’s been open for nearly a year to developers and how that’s informed your view on what you’re going to do with WhatsApp going forward? And then secondly Dave perhaps or Sheryl on the ad load, few years ago you talked about ad load at mid-single-digit levels and then more recently is up significantly since then. Do you still feel like there is still significant room to increase ad load here and how do you think about the theoretical ceiling there? Thanks.
Dave Wehner
I can start with the ad load question, Doug. So, ad load is definitely up significantly from where we were a couple of years ago. And as I mentioned, it’s one of the factors driving an increasing inventory. Really one thing to kind of think about here is that improving the quality and the relevance of the ads has enabled us to show more of them and without harming the experience, and our focus really remains on the experience. So, we’ll continue to monitor engagement and sentiment very carefully. I mentioned that we expect the factors that drove the performance in 2015 to continue to drive the performance in 2016. So, I think that’s the color I can give on ad loads.
Mark Zuckerberg
On Messenger, the platform efforts in 2015 focused on two things. One was expanding the different types of content that people could share in Messenger. And that diversity is going really well. And we see continued increase in video sharing and photos and stickers, and a lot of stuff that you would just call fun but that people really enjoy as different ways to express themselves. But in terms of the business, the more important piece is how people can interact with businesses through Messenger. And we started some early small tests around f8 last year where with some ecommerce services made it so that people who were buying things could follow up with the business and get customer support and buy more things. And we went through this process of integrating that and making sure that it’s integrated with all these system well. And I think everyone is really happy with that so far. So we started off pretty slowly, but that’s going to be some of the basis for how we look to make Messenger a business going forward. And we’re happy with the initial results. There is obviously a lot more there that we need to do and we’ll have more to talk about this year and beyond.
Operator
The next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
John Blackledge 
So, it was a phenomenal quarter and year for Facebook. And given we’re about a month into 2016, there is a lot of discussion around the global macro headwind. Just wondering how the business is trending thus far in the quarter or maybe by market U.S., Europe Asia-Pacific and Rest of World; and generally, just how Facebook is positioned if the global macro environment softens a bit? Thank you.
Dave Wehner
Yes, John, it’s Dave. Just on that question, we’re not commenting specifically on Q1. We didn’t see anything in Q4 that indicated broad-based macro weakness beyond of course the impact that FX was having, which was pretty significant. I mean we saw the impact in places like Brazil, where you’ve gotten in currency headwind of over 30%. So, you’re certainly seeing that impacted. And obviously those sort of global macroeconomic and currency factors will continue to impact us. We’re obviously benefiting from a strong secular shift to usage of mobile and we feel we’re very well positioned in that. We’re seeing more and more advertisers move to mobile; they realize that it’s no longer question of whether they need to be on mobile, but it’s really how they’re going to be on mobile, and we think we’ve got the best solution for that and we’re investing to make it even better. So, I think from a secular trend point of view, we’re very well-positioned, but obviously we’ll continue to monitor the macro conditions and currency.
Operator
The next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just asking for more color on Instagram, it’s obviously still very early days on Instagram. But what are you seeing in terms of user engagement as you continue to move ad load up on the product? What advertiser adoption of the product is? I know you gave us a little bit of color during the prepared comments. And also pricing on the environment inside the platform, as you continue to rollout deeper with the advertising products? Thank you so much.
Sheryl Sandberg
When we introduce ads into feed and continue to increase the ad load, we monitor really carefully. We’re looking at user engagement on the platform, we also look at the quality of ads. And our basic belief is that if we have high quality ads, those create a good consumer experience and we can look at what consumers are doing, because we can understand how actively engaged they are on the platform. For Instagram, we don’t break out revenue. Instagram, and we’re pleased with the growth on Instagram. And as I mentioned, 98 of our top 100 advertisers in Facebook are now advertising on Instagram. It’s also the case that Facebook had remarkably strong growth as well. So, we’re seeing strong growth across those platforms.
I think what’s exciting about those platforms is that they combine the art and the science of both a creative canvas that marketers are excited about and targeting. So to share another example from a holiday, Shutterfly did a Facebook and Instagram, both the brand and direct response holiday campaign on mobile. And what they did was just beautiful pictures but also targeting very specifically to women with specific interest, such as things like weddings and babies, and they saw a 6.4 times return on ad spend. We think that’s what’s possible when you combine the creative canvas we have using the technology and using the platform that we’ve created.
Operator
The next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini
I just had two quick questions. One, Sheryl, I just wanted to follow up on what you said about Facebook and Instagram, and the overlap in the advertisers. And I was wondering if you could share with us how you feel those advertisers view it; do they view it as an incremental platform or there has been some question about whether or not some advertisers might take their spending and just move it over to Instagram. I am just wondering if you see incremental spending as a result of opening up both platforms. And then the second question would just be to Mark. Just I was wondering -- I know you mentioned Oculus and the preorders. I was just wondering if you could give us your take on whether or not you’re happy with the initial launch of Oculus preorders. And also we obviously all know the big gaming impact. But I am just wondering from your perspective, as you look out what industries do you think are -- where this could be the most disruptive outside of gaming? Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg
I will take the Oculus one first. Yes, I am happy. I don’t show much joy, but I am happy. It’s going to be gaming for the beginning. That’s the initial market. There are about -- I think it’s around 250 million people who have Xboxes, Play Station, or Wiis. That’s the initial marketer folks who we think are going to be most interested from the early VR experiences, especially at some of the higher price points. But overall, I mean the reason why we’re interested in this as the social company is that we think that this is going to be a new way that people interact. And if you tried out the Toybox demo with the hands, Oculus Touch, what you see is when you’re in virtual reality with another person and you can interact with the environment and use your hands, you can -- it’s not just about where you are and the fact that you can instantaneously teleport to another place, it’s just you can interact with people in all these different ways that would be very difficult in the rest of the world. So, we’re very excited about that. That’s going to be a big area of investment for us. And it is ultimately I think going to change the way that we communicate and live and work in addition to how we play games. But I think we’re off to a good start.
Sheryl Sandberg
On the Instagram question, certainly in the short-run, some of the spend is incremental and some of it isn’t. Some of our clients approached us where they have a social budget or Facebook budget and some of that moves to Instagram and some people, it’s incremental spend. In the medium to long-run however, we believe that we’re really well-positioned to take share from other platforms out there. We believe both Facebook and Instagram have this combination of an ability to do great creative with the best targeting in a most sophisticated measurement which shows businesses how we help them move products off shelves.
And we want and we tell our clients we want to be the best dollar, the best euro, the best pound and the best minute you spend. And we really encourage them to measure their ROI and compare us to other platforms. We think that comparison bodes very well for our growth. We also think that continued consumer shift to mobile devices bodes well for our growth as well. That said, we have to continue to execute. We know this won’t be easy. We have to continue to build the right products. We have to continue to measure all the way through from seeing an ad impression to sell. And so it’s up to us to stay focused in the coming year and years.
Operator
The next question is from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Ben Schachter
You’ve had a lot of success with standalone apps, so should we expect to see you launching more such apps and could a standalone video app would be a part of that particularly for people who just want to watch a video? And then secondly on the virtual reality, another question. Can you just discuss the supply constraints in terms of how many units you can ship per month? And should we expect those shipments to accelerate into the holiday? And then also related to that, how are you going to work with retailers to show consumers the power of Oculus in store and in person? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg
So, on the apps question, the ones that have done the best are things that augment core Facebook functionality for large subsets of the community. So, for example, we have this Pages Manager App. There are 50 million businesses that have pages on Facebook. And while that is not a huge number compared to the size of the overall community of people, it’s a very large number of people and businesses. And giving a focused experience for the person who wants to run their business through Facebook and be communicating with their customers all day long, that’s just proven to be an incredibly engaging experience that drives content into the system and is good overall. We have introduced a number of things like that for public figures, for groups, messengers, probably been the most successful; it’s something that’s connected to the Facebook experience that now has more than 800 million people using it. So, I do think that there’re additional opportunities for this and we’ll continue looking at them.
Dave Wehner
Ben just following up on VR and supply constraints, so we have two products. You’ve got Gear VR and Samsung is really handling all of that from a hardware perspective, and obviously they’re well prepared on that front. With Rift, it’s really -- it’s early in the evolution of VR; it’s early to be talking about large volumes. So, at this point I don’t think we’re giving a lot of color around supply chain and that sort of thing. It’s not going to be material to our financials this year.
Operator
The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak
I have two, the first one is to go back to some of the core Facebook advertising success. I wonder if you could talk about some of the Facebook video, ad, learning and kind of positive you have encountered and hurdles that you still encounter that could be holding back advertisers from moving further, video budgets out of the platform. And then the second one, we always see this gap between Asia and rest of world monetization versus North America and Europe. I was wondering if you just kind talk through some strategies and qualitative drivers you see over the next couple of years that are going increase the overall Asia and rest of world monetization even further?
Sheryl Sandberg
I think our approach to increasing monetization around the world is really the same. We need to build really compelling ad products with great formats that let marketers be creative and be convincing. I’ll share an example of something we did for an emerging market. I’ve mentioned briefly in my remarks, Slideshow, the Slideshow product is -- enables a video like experience which phone with lower connection speeds and feature phone by series of photos. So, Coca-Cola used that in Kenya and Nigeria. They took screenshots of a video ad they have produced for other markets, they uploaded them with text; and they reached 2 million people with a 10-point lift in ad awareness. So, the way we need to drive sales around the world is by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in India and making sure our products work for market but also being able to connect to those advertising metrics and business metrics around the world.
Video ads are important on our platform and the most important thing that’s growing well there is consumer engagement with video is growing. We have 500 million people watching video a day. And the fact that so much video is being consumed on our platform gives us room for an ads business to grow because we want the formats to match. Marketers also really love video and it’s a really compelling way to reach people and video is contributing to our growth. It’s important to note that it’s not just large brand advertisers that are doing video but all of our market segments. Direct response, SMBs who have uploaded 1.5 million videos and have both organic and paid in the last month, and developers. The video ad spend is not all incremental of course because every time we put an ad in newsfeed, if it’s a video ad, it’s taking a place of an ad with another format.
In terms of learnings, one of the most important learnings we have is that video formats are different on Facebook. There’re certainly people that are watching the whole 30-second video ad with sound, but there are some people that are doing at less, they’re watching shorter formats and they’re watching with sound. And one of the challenges we have in the market is convincing marketers and agencies and people that make the video to expand them with different formats. The good news is that we’re getting great results like the Halo 5 example I shared in my remarks that when people are willing to experiment, this is a pretty unique canvas. You can do short form with sound off, you can be longer firm with sound on and everything in between. And our ability to persuade marketers to experiment is going to be a major driver of how much we can do here.

The next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post
I’ll ask couple of longer term questions. First, I know a year ago you gave us usage update and time spent, wondering if video or any other products are having a big impact on usage and if you can give us any metrics there. And then maybe one for Sheryl, we have you have at 8% of all media time spent. I’m just wondering if you think Facebook could monetize better than other forms of media based on time spent or maybe a little bit below. And then maybe one for Dave, 60% margins last quarter, obviously very strong. And just wondering what you think about the long-term, any comments on long-term margins?
Sheryl Sandberg
In terms of monetizing time spent, it’s certainly the case that consumers have shifted to mobile and businesses need to catch up. The exact [ph] percentage we can monetize that we’ll see, but we certainly think that we will continue to benefit from the consumer shift to mobile, because businesses are behind. If you ask even our largest clients, our largest clients, if they drew a pie chart of where their consumer spend their time and money and whether they spend their time, we’re still under-indexed. That said I’ll say it again, we’ve a lot of hard work to do. We really need to prove to clients particularly as they scale and we become a bigger part of their spent that we’re driving results. Other platforms, other forms of advertising like TV and other have very established metrics that people have believed for a very long time. We think our targeting can be better than any other platform. We also believe our ability to measure results can be deeper, but it’s up to us to prove and to prove that client-to-client.
It’s also worth noting that we work really well with TV. It’s not always the choice of TV or Facebook, but often we can be a complement. We’ve done a bunch of work with Nielsen to measure what happens when marketers do big TV campaigns and do campaigns that are broadly, broadly targeted on Facebook. And we are able to increase the reach and increase brand favorability. So for the most part when people are doing big campaigns, they’re doing them across multiple platforms and we think that will continue.
Dave Wehner
Justin on time spent, there is no question that video is helping us on time spent and engagement. We’re not -- you won’t have any specific stats other than the hours per day -- or sorry time spent per day that Mark mentioned on video. So no updates on stats there other than that. In terms of our long-term margins, we’re not managing the business to a specific margin target in any year. We still think we’re early in investing in the business. And we’re really investing in new areas today where we see a long-term opportunity for revenue growth. That being said, we do think there is a lot of margin potential in this business, given the focus on advertising, but no target at this point.
Operator
The next question is from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is open.
Anthony DiClemente
Thanks for the questions and good afternoon. It’s for Mark or Sheryl, I’m wondering what is your strategy for professional video content going forward. You talked a lot about video with bringing professional media content to Facebook, accelerate video engagement adoption. And then for Dave just kind of back to the quarter, you don’t break out Instagram revenue or financials. But wondering if the acceleration in the quarter, would you say -- was that driven more so by the step up in Instagram given the opening up of the API, the incremental Instagram ad load or was there a commensurate acceleration in the core of Facebook revenue? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
In terms of video content, newsfeed is as interesting as the quality of the content in it. What we’re seeing is that users are generating a lot of really high quality content, often pretty short form that people are really happy to consume. And we believe that trend will continue because we’re at the very beginning with people really understanding the power of the smartphones and lot of people are walking around with particularly in developed market. We are working with publishers to try to make the content experience better inside of newsfeed. The best example of that is probably news with Instant Articles where we figured out that, it was the slowest upload experience you could have in newsfeed to link off to an outside article. So, we worked with publishers to upload more news articles natively to Facebook and we’re seeing great engagement from that.
Similarly, we’ve had conversations with makers of Premium Content, I think they’re excited by the work they already do with us to use Facebook to distribute their content and we’re interested and doing more. It’s probably worth noting that much of the engagement and consumption we have is short form, not long form.
Dave Wehner
Yes, Anthony, it’s Dave. Instagram, we’re certainly very pleased with the performance of Instagram and it certainly made a contribution this quarter. But make no mistake, Facebook, core Facebook is really driving the top-line. And we’re very pleased with the strong performance that we had with Facebook itself in the quarter.
Operator
The next question is from Carlos Karjner with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Carlos Karjner
I have two quick questions. I’m interested in the plans to allow users to do other things beyond liking content. I think you call it Reactions; I call it adding more words to the Facebook graph. Can you talk about the rollout of this capability and whether this is something that you only see at Facebook.com or whether it’s going to be widespread across the web and other sites, much like the like button? And secondly, can you talk about thinking of the role of the different Facebook platforms in payments? I think that you will not do, because you don’t have or do not want to acquire [indiscernible] assets and what’s the boundary for what you could do vis-à-vis payments? Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg
Sure. So Reactions is going to rollout on every platform. We’re testing it in a handful of countries to start just to make sure that we have the UI and interaction simple enough that people could express more of what they wanted without getting in their way, it is adding a little bit of complexity to something that is very simple, say just a one tap like button. But the philosophy behind it is that when you only have a like button, if you share a sad piece of content or something that makes you angry, people may not have the tool to react to it. And therefore over time the community feels less comfortable sharing that kind of content on Facebook. And we want people to be able to share all of the things that are meaningful to them not just the things that are happy and that people are going to like when they see it. And we think that that’s just really important to the mission of the company and we’ll increasing engagement and sharing and openness, and all of the things that we care about.
And so far I think there are a few tweaks that we needed to make to reaction since initially testing it. But its’ going well and I think we plan to roll it out every where pretty soon, so that’s the game plan there.
On payments, the basic strategy that we have is to make it especially in products like Messenger that where the business interaction maybe a bit more transactional, to take all the friction out of making the transactions that you need. So, we don’t view ourselves as a payments business, that’s not the type of company that we are. We’ll partner with everyone who does payment. We look at the stuff that Apple is doing with Apple Pay for example as a really neat innovation in the space that takes a lot of friction out of transactions as well. And our view is that the less friction, the better the user experience, the more people can easily interact with businesses that they care about. And ultimately for our business that will drive up the amount that businesses are willing to pay to advertise to send people into those interactions because they perform well. So it’s good for everyone but that’s how we think about that.
Operator
The next question is from Michael Nathanson with Moffett Nathanson. Your line is open.
Michael Nathanson
Following on Mark’s answer to the question about payments, I wonder Sheryl if you look at the fourth quarter, as you said as defining moment for marketers and with the friction of transactions again easier. Was there any type of shift in the marketers or verticals that move money to Facebook in the quarter? Do you see more retail let’s say or anything different in terms of the competition of who is buying in fourth quarter?
Sheryl Sandberg
Fourth quarter is a holiday quarter, so our top verticals were ecommerce, CPG and retail. Our growth is really broad-based, and I think it really shows how important the targeting can be. What we’ve definitely done over the last year and plan to invest even more in over the next year is worked hard on vertical specific targeting. So for example for the telecom industry being able to target existing consumers with new consumers with people who are -- their voice plan or data plan’s about to expire. With the auto industry, really important industry for growth for us, helping them figure out who their current customers are, who their potential customers are and where are the audience segments out there who have similar likes, interests, backgrounds, demographics to their current customers so that they can serve right ad to the right people. The kind of things we’re able to do with targeting and measurement apply across industries and obviously have to be industry and vertical specific and we’re working hard at that.
Operator
The next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney
Two questions, Sheryl, could you just talk about political advertising and how you think about the attractiveness of -- and any anecdotes you have on Facebook as a platform for political campaign? And then Mark, the story is in 2012 with beginning of that year you realized just how powerful the movement was towards mobile devices and you turned to your engineers and said we need to generate $1 billion in revenue off of mobile devices. And I wonder if you’ve had that same had conversation with your engineers when you think about these two messaging platforms that you have that got a large number of users and clearly globally we’ve seen this massive shift of the words messaging, the interest is changed now, people have engaged with it. Do you feel like you’ve had or do you need to have that $1 billion conversation with your engineers about those two messaging platforms? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
In terms of the election, it’s important to note that we’re large and diversified, so no one vertical drives our business. Yes, the 2016 election is a big deal in terms of ad spend but so is the World Cup, so Super Bowl every year, so are events like the Olympics. We are excited about the targeting we’re able to offer for our ad platform. We believe we have position that doesn’t exist on any other platforms. So for example, using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those. And we’re seeing politicians at all level really take advantage of that targeting.
It’s also probably worth saying that we’re pretty excited about what’s happening with the elections organically on Facebook. Facebook is really the new town hall. And connecting the people who are running for office, both at the national and the local level with people directly has been really important. Every member of Congress in the United States is now on Facebook. We’re seeing some of them post every vote and explain why they’re doing votes. We’re seeing a bunch of that candidates for president get on Facebook themselves and interact taking questions from their potential voters directly. And we think that kind of direct engagement where people can hold their elected officials accountable and elected officials can speak directly to constituents is a really important part of our mission and we’re excited about the 2016 election and what’s happening there.
Mark Zuckerberg
Well, I’ll answer the other one. In terms of the story that you said, I think you have it wrong. I don’t know where you got that story from, I’ve never had a conversation with the team where we were behind on mobile and then I said we need to do this to make money. That’s not really how we operate. What happened is we realized that mobile was growing faster than desktop and that people were shifting their usage and that it was the more important thing for people’s consumer experience. And that’s when we made the shift, not in our business first but in how we develop products. And I told all of our product team and when they come in reviews really just coming with mobile. If you come in and you try to show me a desktop product, then I am going to kick you out; you have to come in and show me a mobile product. And that I think was just as a crude leadership tactic, somewhat effective and helping to motivate the organization to shift its energy towards focusing on mobile.
But if you remember, we actually went through a pretty tough period because we went through this period where our mobile experience was not as good as we wanted it to be and we had no ads on mobile. And we actually prioritized making the mobile experience good before putting ad there. So there was a long time where people thought that our business might not be as good because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always prioritized the experience for people above, even if it’s going to be a painful thing for the company.
So that’s how I think about messaging. We know that messaging is going to be increasingly important, that’s why we went out and hired David Marcus who is one of the best product leaders in the field to Messenger and why we bought WhatsApp, which the leading messaging product worldwide. And we have a formula for how we build these businesses. First, you build a great consumer experience that helps people share in a new way that’s really important. Then after that you can start to introduce organic ways that people can interact with businesses, so that in Facebook is pages, the businesses that people want to interact with, the public figures, the politicians, not necessary ads but organic interactions around not necessarily just your friends and families but more public figures and businesses. And then only once you have that ramped up to a good scale, can you really start dialing up advertising having that feel good and be a good part of your experience with good content because all those public figures and businesses are already participating in the platform at scale.
So, you could expect to see that playbook in Instagram, we’re pretty far along in terms of having quite a mature pubic content. Ecosystem and ads are ramping well with good high quality ads because a lot of public figures and businesses are already investing in creating that kind of good content that goes in Instagram. And you’re going to see the same playbook in Messenger and WhatsApp. In terms of making it so there are organic businesses and public figures, there is a bit more of that on WhatsApp already in terms of businesses using it and our Messenger, we are catching on Messenger; we’ll do that on both. And once we have those ecosystems built out, we will build businesses around them. And that’s how we think about stuff and we’ll do that in all of our products and the different things that we do going forward.
Deborah Crawford
Operator, it looks like we have time for one last question.
Operator
Certainly, the final question is from Paul Vogel with Barclays. Your line is open.
Paul Vogel
Great, thanks. Just two questions, one on the Facebook Sports Stadium, I’m just wondering how you think about that in terms of how is going to be different from other offerings, what’s the big differentiating factor and how do you get folks to participate in that? And the second, so just on the margin side again. Do your revenue and cost line out geographically, so there is obviously a translation impact to the numbers, but is there any operating mismatch between revenue and cost that would either benefit or margins?
Sheryl K. Sandberg
On the Sports Stadium, this is an early test, but we’re pretty excited about it. We are the largest community of sports fans in the world; we have 650 million sports fans on our platform. And people are already using Facebook to share during real-time events. It’s an increasingly important use case for us. So this gives people to share, a place to share that one event and participate in it. I think what you will see from us is always a focus on driving users and driving engagement. This is one way to do it. We’ll see how it works; we’re pretty open to experimentation. So, we feel pretty confident that real-time sharing is an increasingly important part of the platform and one we’ll continue to invest in.
Dave Wehner
And Paul, it’s Dave. I think that question is really around sort of FX and how it relates on the revenue side versus the cost side. And on that front, we’re -- substantial majority of our expenses are U.S. dollar base. So certainly we see an impact to margins with FX headwind. So that’s just the reality of having most of our development resources for instance in the U.S. So beyond that, we don’t do geographic cost breakouts and allocations; it’s not how we run the business. But certainly from an FX point of view, FX headwinds have a dampening effect on margins.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This was another good quarter, and we continue to grow the size and engagement of our community. 1.55 billion people now use Facebook every month and more than 1 billion people use Facebook every day. On mobile, we continue to have a lot of momentum. 1.39 billion people now use Facebook on mobile devices, including more than 1 billion on Android. 50 million people also use Facebook Lite, our app for people on low bandwidth connections and one of our fastest-growing interfaces. This is a great sign for how our mobile strategy continues to make progress across markets, devices and platforms.
When it comes to our business, we're also pleased with our results. This quarter, total revenue reached $4.5 billion and advertising revenue grew by 45% from a year ago. We've already accomplished a lot this year, and these results show how we're getting stronger as a community and as a business.
But we want to serve the entire global community, not just the people who are on Facebook today. Connecting everyone is one of the fundamental challenges of our time and to achieve this, we need to continue innovating faster and investing for the long-term. That means continuing to invest in our core products and services as well as technologies and strategies that allow us to achieve a truly global reach over time.
Let's talk about how we're doing this, and let's start with how we're improving our core products to better serve our existing communities and businesses. This quarter, we introduced some big updates on Facebook to give people more options for expressing themselves. We began rolling out an improved mobile profile design, including the ability to add a profile video instead of just a photo.
We also started testing Reactions, a new version of the Like button that provides more ways for expressing love, awe and sympathy. We think this is going to provide a much more engaging experience.
Another way we're working to improve people's experiences on Facebook is by helping them to share many different types of content with different groups of people they care about. One example is our progress with Groups on Facebook. More than 925 million people now use Groups each month. In some countries, more than half of the population is participating. From a youth organization in Chicago to aid workers dealing with the refugee crisis in Europe, we've seen many inspiring examples of people using Groups to collaborate.
Video is another area where we continue to make progress. On average, there are now more than 8 billion daily video views on Facebook and more than 500 million people who are watching daily. To offer even more engaging video experiences, we've added live video to our Mentions app for public figures, and we now support interactive 360 videos in News Feed. We've also rolled out new video tools for pages and begun testing a dedicated video section on Facebook.
Over the next few years, video is going to be some of the most engaging content online, and by continuing to innovate here, we have a chance to build the best place to watch and share videos.
When it comes to serving businesses, we continue to create a lot of value. We now have more than 2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook and more than 45 million small and medium-sized businesses actively using Facebook pages. This quarter, we continued to focus on helping marketers achieve results while using our ad product, including video and carousel ads as well as on Instagram, and as usual, Sheryl is going to talk more about this in a moment.
Now, let's talk about how we're working to develop our next generation of apps and services. For Instagram, this was a busy quarter. The community celebrated its five-year anniversary and reached a new milestone of 400 million monthly actives. More than 80 million photos are now shared on Instagram every day, and the pace of adoption among public figures, organizations and people around the world continues to grow really well. When President Obama visited Alaska in September, he used Instagram to document his trip, and this is a great example of how Instagram is changing the way that people see the world.
With our efforts in messaging, we're also making progress at building WhatsApp and Messenger both into great platforms of global scale. Last quarter, WhatsApp reached 900 million monthly actives and continues to be on a path to reach 1 billion people and beyond. Messenger has over 700 million monthly actives, and we continue to focus on improving the core messaging experience. A good sign of our progress is the more than 9.5 billion photos now sent monthly on Messenger.
We're also building many different tools that can offer useful experiences to people beyond just traditional messaging. One example is M, a digital assistant we introduced this quarter that over time will use AI to help people complete tasks.
Finally, let's talk about some of our longer-term efforts in innovation to help connect the world. With Internet.org, we have a lot of momentum. We've now rolled out free basic Internet services to people in 29 countries, and overall brought more than 15 million people online. As we rolled out the program, we've made a number of improvements based on feedback from communities and partners, including opening up our platform for free basic services to all developers who want to build.
Meanwhile, our work on new technologies to connect people in the most remote regions continues to make progress. This quarter we revealed Aquila, our first aircraft designed to beam internet into communities down from the sky. And we also announced a partnership to bring internet to large parts of sub-Saharan Africa using a satellite, which is launching next year.
And with Oculus, we're in a great position to begin delivering a new generation of shared immersive experiences, we plan to ship the Rift headset early next year. And Gear VR, our mobile product with Samsung, is going to have its first consumer release this holiday season retailing for $99. And we also announced new partnerships with Minecraft, Netflix and Twitch and many other content partners.
Virtual reality has the potential to be the next computing platform that changes all of our lives. It's important also to recognize that this is going to grow slowly, like computers and mobile phones when they first arrived. So we're committed to Oculus and virtual reality for the long-term.
So that's how we've continued to make progress on our strategy this quarter. The results we've achieved show that our investments are creating a lot of value for our community and the world. I just want to thank the entire Facebook community, our employees, our partners and our shareholders for helping us to continue moving forward. We've done a lot, but there's always more to do.
And now I'm going to hand it off to Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Thanks, Mark. And hi, everyone. We had an excellent third quarter. Results were strong across the board. Ad revenue grew 45% year-over-year or 57% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue was $3.4 billion and grew 73% year-over-year. Mobile now makes up 78% of our total advertising revenue.
Our business grew across all regions and marketer segments. Like last quarter, we saw especially strong growth in our North America and Asia-Pacific regions. Overall, we're really pleased with marketer adoption of our ad products around the world. Our results show that we continue to make progress on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People have already shifted to mobile and this shift is driving engagement on Facebook. The average American adult spends 25% of their media time on mobile, and Facebook and Instagram together continue to account for over one minute in five minutes on mobile in the U.S. Businesses are lagging behind consumers in making this shift to mobile, and we believe we're well positioned to help them catch up. Facebook Pages are already the mobile solution for millions of businesses. Pages now offer better messaging capabilities, call-to-action buttons and news sections that enable businesses to highlight important information.
We're also capitalizing on the shift to mobile by expanding ads on Instagram. This quarter on Instagram, we introduced new ad formats and objectives, opened up our API and launched self-serve ad capabilities. Instagram ads are now available in all countries where we offer Facebook ads, and marketers can manage campaigns across both platforms with the same targeting. We're really pleased with the marketer demand for Instagram ads.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. In September at Adweek, we announced that we have over 2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook. With more than 45 million active SMB Pages on Facebook, we think there's a lot of opportunity to turn even more of these businesses into marketers.
Marketers come to Facebook and Instagram because we have the best performing mobile ad products, and video is making them even better. Marketers have always loved using video to tell stories. As Mark discussed, video is a natural and growing part of our mobile News Feed experience. Video on Facebook gives marketers not just mass reach, but better cross-device targeting and measurement than we believe is available on any other platform. We're especially pleased with the breadth of marketers using video on Facebook, from brands to direct response to SMBs. Over 1.5 million small businesses posted video, which includes organic video posts and video ads on Facebook in the month of September alone.
Video ads complement TV ads. According to a recent study with Nielsen Research, marketers using Facebook ads with TV ads saw higher reach, ad recall, brand linkage and likeability. To share one example, GMC used video and other ads on Facebook to extend the reach of their TV brand campaign highlighting their premium trucks and SUVs. The Facebook campaign drove a 13-point lift in ad recall and a 6-point lift in brand favorability.
We recently introduced target rating point, TRP, buying so that marketers can plan, buy and measure video ads on Facebook the same way they do on TV. We're pleased with the feedback we're receiving on this from marketers and agencies.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. We know relevant ads are more engaging for people and, therefore, drive better results for businesses. Products like carousel ads and dynamic product ads help improve effectiveness for marketers. Carousel ads show multiple images and now videos and drive 30% to 50% lower cost per conversion than single image link ads. Dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to upload their product catalog, are driving ROI comparable to Search.
For example, Marriott uses DPA to re-target travelers based on their travel search habits and they are now scaling globally across their portfolio of brands. LatAm e-commerce company, MercadoLibre, uses DPA to re-market over 38 million products in over 13 countries. Both are seeing high ROI and continuing to invest.
On the measurement side, Conversion Lift is helping clients see the real business results from their campaigns. Boost Mobile, a Sprint brand, showed ads to people eligible for device upgrades. Using Conversion Lift, they were able to attribute a 4% lift in in-store sales to their Facebook campaign.
Finally, we're continuing to invest in ad tech across Atlas, LiveRail and the Audience Network. This quarter, we expanded the ad formats publishers in the Audience Network can add to their mobile apps. On LiveRail, this quarter we began testing age and gender targeting. LiveRail can now deliver over 90% accuracy on age and gender segments across desktop, mobile web and mobile apps versus a non-target rate of only 31% to 55% when not using LiveRail technology.
I want to take a moment to thank our clients around the world for their continued partnership and congratulate our global Facebook teams on great execution. Looking forward, we're going to stay focused on our priorities to continue to build a solid foundation for our long-term business.
Now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Sheryl. And good afternoon, everyone. Echoing Mark and Sheryl's comments, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $4.5 billion in revenue and over $1.4 billion in free cash flow. Growth and engagement of our community again provided a great platform for our strong financial performance this quarter. In September, we reached a new milestone with over 1 billion people using Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.55 billion people who used Facebook during the month of September.
Mobile continued to drive our growth. In September, approximately 1.39 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year. Additionally, our next generation of services continued to grow, with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp now exceeding 400 million, 700 million and 900 million monthly actives respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $4.5 billion, up 41%, or 51% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue was $4.3 billion, up 45%, or 57% on a constant currency basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue in Q3. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q3 2014 levels, our total revenue would have been approximately $340 million higher.
Regionally, U.S. and Canada and Asia-Pacific were our strongest markets, producing ad revenue growth of 56% and 48% respectively. Europe and Rest of World grew more slowly at 33% and 29% respectively, impacted by our currency exposure in both of those regions.
As Sheryl mentioned, mobile continued to drive our revenue growth. Mobile ad revenue was $3.4 billion, up 73% from last year representing 78% of our advertising revenue. Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down approximately 8%.
We have been very pleased with the sustained high growth of mobile advertising revenue. There are a number of important factors contributing to that growth both from the supply and demand side. The drivers of year-over-year mobile revenue growth fell into three main categories. First, as Sheryl covered, we have continued to have success driving strong advertiser demand. Second, we've grown both the number of people using Facebook and the time that they spend with us. And third, the growth in advertiser demand and ad quality has enabled us to increase ad load over time. As we have grown mobile advertising, we have remained very pleased with overall engagement levels, user satisfaction with News Feed and the overall quality of the ads themselves.
Turning now to our overall price/volume metrics. In Q3, the average price per ad increased 61% while total ad impressions declined 10% on a year-over-year basis. As I've indicated on prior calls, the changes in our reported price-volume metrics have been driven recently by the change in the number of right hand column ads and the shift to mobile. These factors will have a less significant impact on the reported price-volume metrics going forward now that a full year has elapsed since the redesign of right-hand column ads, and now that mobile impressions have grown to become the majority of impressions.
In fact, the quarter-over-quarter trends already point to that. In Q3, total ad impression increased 7% sequentially and average price per ad increased 5%. Total payments and other fees revenue was $202 million, down 18% compared to last year. The decline was expected and was driven by a reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q3 total GAAP expenses were $3 billion, up 68%, and non-GAAP expenses were $2.1 billion, up 51%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expenses were driven by increases in head count related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. We ended Q3 with nearly 12,000 employees, up 44% compared to last year. We added over 1,000 employees to Facebook in the quarter and we are pleased with the continued strength in our recruiting efforts.
Our Q3 GAAP operating income was approximately $1.5 billion, representing a 32% operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was $2.4 billion, representing a 54% margin. Our Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 37% and 32% respectively. Our Q3 GAAP net income was $896 million or $0.31 per share, and our non-GAAP net income was $1.6 billion or $0.57 per share. In Q3, capital expenditures were $780 million as we continued to invest in servers, network infrastructure, and the build-out of data centers and other facilities to support the rapid growth of the business. We generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with over $15.8 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We remain focused on growing the number of people who use our services, increasing advertiser demand and improving the quality and relevance of our ads. Across these dimensions, we continue to see healthy growth opportunities ahead for Facebook and Instagram. Given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past year, we will continue to face currency headwinds next quarter, particularly in Europe and Latin America. In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenues to decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4, similar to the trend that we have experienced over the last couple quarters.
Now, turning to the expense outlook. We expect the year-over-year growth rate for total full year 2015 GAAP expenses to be approximately 55%, and for total full year non-GAAP expenses to be approximately 50%. We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. We continue to expect our 2015 stock-based compensation to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses for the full year 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million.
And lastly, we anticipate our Q4 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be several percentage points above the respective Q3 rates. In summary, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community and the momentum in our business, which together support our ability to continue investing to build our next generation of services and execute on our mission of connecting the world.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Your first question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. Mark, maybe one for you and one for Sheryl. For Mark, on virtual reality and Oculus, how do you see the development of the entertainment and content ecosystem around virtual reality playing out in 2016 and beyond? And what's the role Facebook's going to have to play in maybe seeding some of the content and entertainment side of VR.
And then for Sheryl, any color you can give us on Instagram? We've obviously seen a ramp-up now in advertising on the property. How the company's thinking about ad load monetization, some of the opportunities and how those will be balanced against engagement. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I can start off talking about Oculus and virtual reality. So the first thing that I want to stress here is that these kind of new platforms take a long time to develop. So we've said often that we think that virtual reality and augmented reality could be the next big computing platform. But just to put that in perspective and compare it to the development of previous computing platforms like phones and computers, I think the first smartphones came out in 2003, and in the first year, I think BlackBerry and Palm Treo were the initial smartphones that came out. And I think they each sold in the hundreds of thousands of units. So just to kind of give a sense of the timeframe that we're thinking about this and how we expect this to develop, that's how we're thinking about that.
In terms of the actual content, first, we think gaming is going to be the most obvious market. There are around, I think, more than 200 million, almost 250 million people who have either an Xbox, a PlayStation or a Wii, and we think that that audience is going to the type of people who are going to be very excited about the type of experiences initially that you can have with virtual reality.
And the advantage of that is also that some of those can be single player experiences. They don't require a big network effect or a lot of people having the technology or a large installed base. Once we start getting a bit further along with that, then the next thing that we think is going to be huge is video and immersive experiences, both things that people can create, like the social content that they share on Facebook today, and more professional and premium content both short form and longer form.
But we'll start to see some experimentation with that. There already is some very good content. But until there are millions of units out in the market, I don't expect that to be a big industry for folks to be investing a huge amount in 2016. Then when they're starting to get to be more units, just like every other major computing platform before that, what we expect is that a large portion of what people do in it will be communication and social behavior, and that's where Facebook really has the DNA and experience to, I think, build the best experiences. And we're investing in trying to figure out what that's going to look like, and that's ultimately a lot of what we're extremely excited about for a number of years down the road.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On Instagram, we think that with Facebook and Instagram, we now have the two most important mobile platforms out there. And what we bring to this is a common ad infrastructure. So Instagram ads, now that we've rolled out as we have this past quarter and gotten to a really good product offering, combined the creative format of Instagram which is very visually compelling and has a lot of engagement from people with the back-end infrastructure and marketer base that Facebook has.
So now, we have self-service ads rolled out. We've rolled out in all countries where we offer Facebook ads. We have new ad formats for Instagram. We're able to do more business objectives, all of which can use the same targeting as we have on Facebook and all of which are increasingly tapping into our measurement capabilities. On ad load, we have a lot of experience rolling out ads into feed-based products and we monitor it very carefully and we're going to continue to monitor really carefully. We're also excited about how they work together.
Just to share one example, American Express working with Digitas, rolled out carousel ads on Instagram that targeted travel-related interest groups for people who are 18 years and older. They then retargeted those same people on Facebook. And what they created was a really visual journey using the format that is Instagram, the format that is Facebook and combining the two platforms that they're targeting. We think we're at the very beginning of what's possible when we combine these two.
Operator
The next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you. I had two quick questions as well. One, Sheryl, just to follow up on what you mentioned about Instagram, obviously, it's a very visual experience. I'm just wondering, when you're talking to advertisers, are they viewing this as a separate channel? So I think there's been some questions as to the incremental nature of Instagram. And it would seem like it could be extremely incremental, given these are the two top platforms in mobile. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what the advertisers say about blending the experiences.
And also, a question for Mark. I was just wondering if you could share with us how we might see your content strategy evolve over time and, in particular, just wondering what your view is on longer form content on the video side, sorry. Thank you.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Yeah. To the Instagram question, what we see in the short run is that some of the spend on Instagram is incremental to Facebook and some isn't. Some clients are comfortable with Instagram and bringing a new budget to bear. Some clients are shifting some of their Facebook budget. For us in the medium to long run, we believe that we're not competing between Facebook and Instagram. We're competing with other forms of media. And if you want the most eyeballs and we think the highest ROI, over time we think that will benefit Facebook and Instagram.
And so, for us, what we really want is people to experiment and learn and get to experience Instagram as they have on Facebook so that we can make the case that we can improve the ROI and then we believe if you look at the consumer metrics of where people were spending their time, we will be able to gain share compared to almost anything else you can buy out there.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And to your question about long form content, the more natural starting point for us is shorter form content which can either be social content or premium short form content. But some of – the vast majority of the content that's consumed on Facebook just talking about video right now is people browsing through feed. They discover something interesting that they weren't necessarily looking for previously that's very powerful because that's a behavior that there isn't really anywhere else to do at scale on the Internet today in a great way, and then people watch it there or they bookmark it to watch later.
But if you're talking about watching inline and feed, that's not the place where you're necessarily going to see a TV show and then watch an hour-long clip right there. So what we're actually seeing is that a lot of the best or at least from my perspective, TV shows that we see folks like Jimmy Fallon breaking up their show into clips that they can now share to be consumed over social media and on the Internet in three-minute to five-minute or seven-minute segments which are more of what people want when browsing through News Feed. So I do think over time we will get to more different types of content and we'll build products that serve that. The current market of trying to help people share and experience all these shorter form clips is massive. We are nowhere near serving that as well as we want to.
So I actually think in a lot of ways though the more interesting question is not in the near-term what we're going to do to develop ways to consume long form content, but what traditional media and content producers who have traditionally produced short and long form content are going to do to chunk their stuff up better so that way it can be more easily consumed by this big community online.
Operator
The next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you for taking the question. One for Mark and then one for Dave. Mark, you recently spent time in China and India. And I was hoping to get some of your key takeaways both in terms of Internet.org and then also about Facebook's potential in China.
And then secondly, Dave, I was hoping to get some early thoughts on OpEx for 2016, at least perhaps qualitatively, if you could walk us through some of the puts and takes for next year, Oculus in particular. Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. I can start off with the India and China question. So they are very different situations. So India is a unique country where there are 1.25 billion people, more than 1 billion of them are not on the Internet. So it is the country in the world that benefits the most from connectivity. And there's a lot of research that we've seen and reports that third parties have put out that show, that when you connect to place like India, it makes a very big difference socially and for the economy there.
A lot of us here, everyone we know is on the internet and we think about the internet as entertainment and basic communication but if you don't have access to a good school, then getting basic Internet access could be your best educational information or if you don't have access to a good doctor, then getting access to the Internet could be the only way that you can learn about how to avoid certain diseases or how to raise your kids and help them avoid certain diseases and find jobs and a lot of stuff.
So what we find through the research is that for every 10 people who get connected to the Internet, just a little less than or right around one person gets lifted out of poverty and one new job gets created. So we're very focused on this. It's a huge priority for the Indian government and anything that we can do to help there, we think is very good for the world and we're invested in that, and we're happy to support.
So in Internet.org in India now, there are already more than 1 million people who now have access to the Internet who didn't otherwise because of our efforts, so we're proud of that but obviously that's still very early on. We're only working with one operator currently in part of the country. So there's a lot of room to expand that and that's just a big opportunity for the Internet overall and for India over the next decade and we hope to play a role in that.
On China, that is a more complex situation. Obviously, you can't have a mission of wanting to connect everyone in the world and leave out the biggest country. So over the long-term, that is a situation that we will need to try to figure out a way forward on.
For now, the thing that I would leave you with is that people think that Facebook isn't in China at all and that's actually not true. Our consumer service isn't active there, but it actually is already one of the biggest advertising markets that we have. Because there are a lot of really big and important Chinese companies who sell a lot of products to people outside of China, and they use Facebook as one of their primary tools in a lot of cases to spread information about what they're doing and grow their customer base. So we're happy to do whatever we can to help develop the economies in both of those countries and they're both long-term efforts for us.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Doug, on your question on 2016, we're not going to obviously give specific guidance at this time, that'll be coming with our Q4 call. But we're focused on continuing to invest heavily in the business across our near, mid and long-term opportunities and we see a bunch of great opportunities to invest there. So in the near term, we're focused on growing the community and executing on our existing business. In the medium-term, we're focused on those next generation of services, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. And in the long-term, we've got the investments we're making and things like artificial intelligence, VR, and obviously the Internet.org efforts that Mark just spoke about.
Specifically with regards to Oculus and how that could impact the plan for next year, we're, as Mark said, very bullish about the long-term opportunity for VR and excited about the launch for the Rift next year. But VR is still very much in the development stage. So it would be early to be talking about large shipment volumes.
Operator
The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Mark and one for Sheryl. Mark, can you talk a little about what factors and metrics you consider when you're thinking about a multi-app strategy versus rolling out more products and offerings on Facebook? There's a difference in Facebook Paper, Messenger, the video viewer on the platform. Just be curious how you think about multi-app versus adding more functionality to the mothership.
And then for Sheryl, it sounds like there's still a lot of SMBs on the platform that are not yet paying advertisers. Can you talk about some of the biggest hurdles you need to overcome to get more SMBs paying and initiatives you have in place? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. So I can talk to the multi-app question first. So we view the social space as almost this matrix. You can think about it as a two-dimensional grid where one axis is the richness of the content that people want to share, then other axis is the size of the audience, or intimacy of how people want to share. So on the first axis, you get everything ranging from text to links, to photos, to videos, to immersive 360 videos and virtual reality content and this progression.
And on the other axis, you get everything ranging from one-to-one messaging to small group communication, to communicating with all your friends at once, to big interest groups, to completely public. And what we believe is that you can intersect at any point on that. And there will be something interesting to build. So a small group product for sharing video, that's going to be a thing. A one-on-one product for sharing text or calling, that's clearly a thing. A public sharing and consumption product for video, that's a thing.
And what we've tried to do is basically figure out the areas that we think are open and are not currently served by the set of products that the industry has built and figure out a way to offer those. So one of the big opportunities that I'm really excited about right now is I think that there's a pretty big opening between very private messaging, the one-on-one messaging products like Messenger and WhatsApp, and products like Facebook where you share with all your friends at once or Instagram.
And in between there, what we're seeing is this huge growth of private groups, right, and Groups remains one of the I think least talked about products on Facebook. But I just said earlier that we have more than 900 million people are using that every month. It's a huge thing and it's a big area that we can develop going forward.
So we experiment with all these things in terms of some of them make sense to naturally have inside the Facebook app because you're using the same set of friends and network and connections. Some of them get clear value by being separate, like Messenger, for example, where we can make sure that everyone has their push notifications turned on, which is extremely important for a messaging app. But overall, there's a lot of stuff in the space. And the amount that people want to share and communicate is boundless and that's I think partially why we're seeing the growth that we are with so many of these products.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On SMBs, I think it's one of the most compelling opportunities we have for Facebook and that's because I think we solve a really big problem for SMBs, which is how are they going to reach customers. In the United States, which is usually the most advanced market, 35% of small businesses have no web presence at all. And building a mobile presence is even harder than a web presence because most people don't use the mobile web and mobile apps are expensive to build and hard to get people to use, especially if you're a small business.
That's why there are 45 million SMB pages on Facebook. These are people who are using Facebook and this free product to create an online and increasingly a mobile presence. And then our job is to make sure that free product works for them and then over time bring them into our paid products. We have 2.5 million advertisers and over 80% of them started on Pages and then started with simplified ad products. And that's what we've done over time and we'll continue to do that.
And what you see is that it's as easy for them to use it as profile and we can give them opportunities to do things they otherwise couldn't do. So to what I said in my transcript before, 1.5 million SMBs posting videos in one month alone. 1.5 million SMBs have not posted or created video on any other platform, but with us it's cheap, it's very easy to use and that gives us a way to continue to work with SMBs and increasingly grow our business with them.

The next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
First, Mark, could you talk a little bit about how much activity you see around Events on Facebook and maybe your views on whether Facebook could benefit from political activity or advertising? And then, Sheryl, could you talk a little bit about where ad loads are today? Is there still room there? And also just what your feedback you're getting on advertiser ROIs, is there still more room there? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, sure. I'll start with the question on ad load. It's Dave and then Sheryl can follow up on the political question. So, yeah, so, Justin, over time ad load has been one of the factors driving year-over-year growth. It's just worth noting that it is up significantly from where we were two years ago. Looking forward, we continue to feel like there are good opportunities to grow the business. I talked about the three factors that contributed to growth this quarter: ad demand, users and engagement and ad load. And we see all of those continuing to be factors for growth going forward.
And then, Sheryl, did you want to take the question on the political?
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Yeah. And I'll take Events, too. Just as Mark said with Groups, Events are growing quickly on Facebook. We don't break out by product, but we're pleased with the growth.
On the elections and political activity and political advertising, we're excited about the elections because we think we give politicians and people a really compelling way to interact. If you wanted to feel like you were interacting with someone running for office before, you had to go to a town hall meeting. And increasingly, that's happening on Facebook. So between January 1 and October 7 of this year, over 68 million people on Facebook in the U.S. made over 1 billion interactions about the campaign alone, and every candidate and every member of Congress is on Facebook now.
In terms of the revenue impact, no one vertical drives our business. We have a very large and diversified business. But we think we offer something pretty compelling, which is the reach of Facebook with very unique targeting. So on Facebook, you can target an ad by district, by interest. Ben Carson ran 240 different ads targeted at different audiences, and so we're starting to see candidates use our platform to communicate, to advertise and to share.
Operator
The next question is from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Thank you very much. Mark, on the subject of media content on Facebook, it seems like the big opportunity is for Facebook to be the portal with which to access the short form video content that you mentioned earlier, and maybe the idea is to keep the consumption of that content in line or inside the Facebook wall, the garden. So the follow-up question that I would have is how do you think you could best partner with the media providers and convince them the merits of bringing their valuable, in some cases expensive, content into the Facebook world, particularly at a time in media when they're really trying hard to guard their own existing ecosystems?
And then a question for Sheryl. I wonder if you could just touch on the relative growth of branded advertising versus direct response ads. You mentioned total ratings point buying. Can you help us think about the mix of branded versus DR? And for you, do you think that TRP buying and video is going to shift your ad mix more towards branded over time? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I can talk about video and the business model around that. So you're definitely right that there's a certain class of content which is only going to come on to Facebook if there's a good way to compensate the content owners for that. And we've recently rolled out the business model for this, which is for premium content, we'll give a revenue share on a portion of the views to the content owners. And we've got good feedback so far on that. We're working with a small set of partners to start, and we'll roll it out beyond that as that keeps on going.
But it's important to keep in mind that there are a few different reasons why people share content on Facebook, and that's just one of the use cases, right? There are a lot of people who are just sharing content socially, right, because they want to get a message out. That may not be business motivated. There are a lot of folks who are business motivated but who primarily post content in order to promote something or gain distribution for something. And that you can gain value without some kind of rev share, and that's why the video ecosystem has grown so quickly even before we rolled out a revenue share.
And now the third class of content, which I think is going to be important and increasingly important over time is the one that you basically want to essentially trade the content for money, and that is one where you need the rev share to unlock that. But we're getting good feedback on that upfront. So we're looking forward to seeing how that trends.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On our marketer segments, we don't break out by segment, but all of our marketer segments are growing. We're seeing strong growth in brand, and we believe that's because we're delivering on the promise of personalized marketing at scale. So we've worked hard on things that will help brand purchasers feel comfortable on the platform and measure their ROI. So that's where TRP buying comes in, allowing people who usually buy TV ads to plan, buy and measure Facebook ads the same way, enables apples-to-apples comparison that we believe is very strong for our ROI. We've also worked on brand awareness optimization, mobile polling to measure campaign effectiveness, and we're working client by client.
Our other segments are growing as well. We're working hard in the direct response area, rolling out things like carousel ads and dynamic product ads. And one thing that's worth understanding is that all of these different marketer segments often work together.
So to share one example, IKEA wanted to boost their online sales when their stores were closed. So in Norway, most retailers are closed Saturday to Sunday night. So they invested in carousel ads and only show them when their stores were closed and they turned a $35,000 investment in carousel ads into $2 million in sales which happened precisely when they want it to happen. That's a direct response ad buy because it's very specific carousel ads product but it's also a brand play for them as they strengthen their brand and get people to interact with them as they want them to.

The next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. Two questions. So with the explosive video consumption growth and growth in public content being consumed in the News Feed, could engagement perhaps materially increase from current levels over the next couple years? And then on WhatsApp, as it heads towards 1 billion MAUs, and/or greater, could you give us a sense of how you're thinking about monetization of that platform and perhaps timing of the monetization? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
On engagement, John, I think we're obviously focused across a number of different dimensions to drive engagement. Videos had a big contribution there. So that's certainly been helpful in terms of making News Feed even more engaging and we'll continue to be focusing on a number of initiatives, public content and just sharing with your friends. So there's lots that we are working on on engagement that continue to drive time spent.
On WhatsApp, I don't think there's a particular magical number with 1 billion users. The focus really for our messaging products is to continue to drive user growth and continue to build great products that are fast, useful, engaging and fun. And on that front, they're both doing great. Messenger has over 700 million users and WhatsApp obviously has over 900 million users. So the business side is not the main focus right now, but we believe there are going to be opportunities as we further scale those properties.
Operator
The next question is from Paul Vogel with Barclays. Your line is open.
Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Two questions. One, big picture, Mark, there's a lot of debate around what content is appropriate for Facebook to block and not block. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you decide what to censor and not censor in terms of on the content side. And then less big picture, but just in terms of fourth quarter, given it's a big retail quarter, any increased testing around direct retail on the platform? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I can answer the policy question and then I guess Sheryl will take the other one. The guiding principle for us on this is that we want to give the most voice to the most people. And the idea is that there are all these different barriers that any given person has to being able to share and express everything that they want, from technical barriers, it's really hard to communicate with someone if you're not on the internet and they're far away, to product barriers, it's hard to share videos if we don't have a good product for sharing videos, to legal barriers, it's hard to share content that your government says is illegal for you to share.
And at the end of the day, there's also policy and you're in a community and we have community standards for how we think people should communicate in order to be safe. Because even if you have all of the internet connectivity and the products and the legal framework that you need, if you don't feel safe saying what you want to express, then you're probably not going to share it. And we see a lot of that online and that's a pretty big issue from everything from bullying to terrorism, there are lots of reasons why people might otherwise have the tools to share what they would want but feel silenced. And that isn't giving the most voice to the most people.
So we feel a responsibility to have policies for our community which limit hate speech and limit things which are going to create just an overwhelmingly uncomfortable environment for people that is going to silence other people's speech in order to make sure that over the long-term we are enabling the most people to be able to express as much as possible as they can. And that's the philosophy that we have.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On commerce going into the holiday season, commerce is a really important vertical for us and we're working hard to make our ads more effective. So what we're seeing from DPA ads and carousel ads, we're really happy with. We're seeing lower cost per conversion. When people do multiple objectives and video, we're seeing lower cost per click than single image link ads.
And importantly, we're also creating better experiences for people because when an ad is more targeted, more relevant, when you see a product you're interested in or a service you're interested in, that's a better experience. So we go into the holidays feeling that we have a really strong product offering, certainly the best product offering we've ever had to connect people to the products they're going to buy this holiday.

The next question is from Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Your line is open.
Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. When you look at ad quality, I think when Facebook started, Sheryl, you were really adamant that you were focused on improving the ad quality and really making sure you were serving the highest quality ad to the right person. When you look at Instagram, I felt like you took incredible care to make sure that the advertising, like every ad, was of the highest quality.
And as you've opened up the API, there's a tremendous amount of ads, some of them incredibly good quality, but some of them of lesser quality. How do you work to make sure that Instagram maintains what you started it with, which is incredibly beautiful ads that fit the platform and so that you don't get criticized by users for pushing, not so much the amount of ads, but the type of ads?
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
You're right. The quality is really important to us because your experience on Facebook or Instagram is about the quality of what you see, both in terms of the organic posts you see from your friends or public people you're following and the ads as well. And what we do is we monitor it carefully. We ramp slowly, we monitor engagement, sentiment, quality of ads. We get a lot of feedback directly from people who use Facebook. They can X out the ads. If they do, we ask them why they're Xing out the ads and we just continue to monitor the metrics.
We're pleased with what's happened with quality on our platform overall. And a lot of the product innovations and investments I've been talking about on this call feed into quality. So the carousel ads, they're not just that they're showing multiple products, it's that they're showing products that are more specifically directed at the person. And so a lot of the underlying things we do to build our ad systems don't just feed into revenue, they feed into quality. And that's important because over the long run our quality today is our revenue tomorrow.

The next question is from Mark May with Citi. Your line is open.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. I had two, if I could. We noticed a very impressive acceleration in user MAU growth and focus in the quarter. It seemed like it was pretty much in every region of the world. What, if anything, can you attribute that to? I know that you seem to be running more TV ads, at least where I live. But wonder if anything you could attribute that to.
And then secondly, again on video, as more and more people and businesses are uploading video, I assume that there's a lot of good video content on Facebook, but I don't see all of it. Question is really around video discovery. What strategies do you have going forward to improve video discovery from what is today more of a push-based model to something that may be akin to a pull-based model where I can enjoy all the great video content that's on Facebook? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Mark, it's Dave. Just on the user growth point, we're obviously pleased with the growth we're seeing across the globe in terms of DAU growth. The three largest countries were India, the U.S. and Brazil. So we're seeing good diversified growth. I mean, specifically we've made a lot of initiatives to help improve and invest in the Facebook experience in emerging markets and that has helped drive some of the acceleration in growth. And so we've made a number of product and performance investments there with Facebook like being a good example of that. The question then was on video and discovery and...
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Yeah.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And also just on the growth point, I just think the team that's working on that is executing extremely well. I mean, sometimes it's not that you came up with some brilliant strategy, it's just like really good work consistently over a long period of time. So – and then I think they are. On video, yeah, right now the strength in our system is definitely through helping people discover content that they hadn't really asked for through News Feed. And a lot of, I think, what we need to do is give people a way to see all of the videos that page that they like or follow is interested in sharing on Facebook.
And there's a pretty clear roadmap of stuff that we're going to do over the next couple of years that I'm quite excited about to add some more dimensions to the video experience on Facebook. But we're just so early in this right now. It's pretty amazing how quickly it's growing but there's a lot more to do.

The next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. I just had one for Sheryl. Sheryl, you mentioned that Marriott and MercadoLibre are both using DPA and seeing comparable ROI to paid search. That's a pretty incredible data point. So I guess the question is, what kind of lift in ROI and overall budget do you see as e-commerce or travel marketers migrate from your first few products, like custom audiences and other to DPA? And are the yields that you're getting from DPA ads higher than other formats like video and app downloads and those types of things? Thank you.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Our goal is to give marketers the highest return they can and over time to capture the amount of budget that's equivalent to the percentage of media time we capture and we're not there. Consumers have shifted to mobile and consumers have moved to Facebook and Instagram more quickly than ad budgets. And that's the opportunity we have in front of us. What product you use really depends upon what you're trying to do. If you're trying to tell a brand story, then you want to do a video ad. If you're trying to sell a direct product, then you want to use DPA ads. And all of these products and all of the underlying targeting like custom audiences are designed to help people meet different objectives and we're trying to be really clear on that.
If you're trying to move a brand objective, if you want to move favorability or brand sentiment, we can do that and that's often a video ad or one of our branded ads where you optimize for brand awareness. If you're trying to sell a product, you might want to use carousel ads or dynamic product ads. And the targeting that is custom audiences underlies all of our product offerings. So our goal is to have lots of different things we can do for our marketers and measure them really deeply all the way through to business results.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
And – sorry, Ross, you just asked about yields. The way the auction system works is going to just be whatever is the ad that is going to necessarily have the best return is going to win in the auction. So it doesn't necessarily mean you're paying a premium for a given product and so if we've got a good DPA ad that might win in the auction for a given user.
Deborah Crawford - Director-Investor Relations
Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Certainly. The final question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Let me try going back to future use cases and, Mark, I think this was touched on a couple times. But can you talk about whether you're seeing greater attempts to do Search, the Search functionality on the site and how that could change over the next three years to five years, and also comment on news and to the extent to which you're seeing a rising utilization by regular users of Facebook as a way to get news and what you can do to make that even easier for people if that's something a behavior you want to facilitate? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. So on Search, we already have one very big use case which is people basically using our search engine to look out pages and people who are on Facebook and that by itself is already one of the biggest search engines in the world. The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and I think is going to – is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook. So that's trending. It's people finding post that their friends or others had posted in News Feed that they saw but then might want to go check out later.
And I think this is going to be a very important part of the video experience as well, because one half is pushed, right, going to News Feed and not asking for content but just coming across and discovering it. And then the other half is pull, right, and going to some experience where you're asking for some type of content and getting to a point where we can do that very well is just going to add a whole new dimension to the service. So that's something I remain very excited about. In some ways, it's taken a little bit longer than I'd expected to get to a point where it's growing quickly. The people and page lookup part is doing very well, the post part has taken a bit longer but I'm very excited about that going forward.
In terms of news, I mean the biggest issue with news today in Facebook is that it is the slowest part of the experience, right? When you go to load a video and it loads quickly, we made it auto-play to load even quicker. You tap on a photo, you expect it to expand immediately, but you tap on a link, and often it can take 10 seconds to load and if you're on a 2G connection somewhere in the developing world, that could take 30 seconds to load.
So the big initiative that we have here which I'm really excited about is Instant Articles and the big thing that that does is just it lets publishers basically put the content on our servers ahead of time and that way when people tap on it, it loads instantaneously. And it can be a much more immersive experience and we've already found from the initial experiments that we've done that the engagement is positive and we're starting to roll that out more broadly. So I think that that's going to be a really big deal for improving the experience of reading news on Facebook and it's something that we've been working on for a while, and I'm very excited about it.
So, yeah, I would expect that we will see an expansion of sharing and consumption of all of the different types of things that you asked about: news, video, search and the different experiences there, and these are some of the big areas that we're investing in and they're long-term investments and they're big investments and we're going to keep on pushing on them, but I think that's what we need to do to serve our community well and ultimately connect everyone in the world. So thank you, guys.

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Deborah. And thanks, everyone, for joining today. This is a good quarter for us. We've continued to make good progress in the growth of our community with 1.49 billion people now using Facebook each month and more than 1.3 billion people using Facebook on mobile. We've also continued to make gains in engagement. More than 968 million people worldwide now use Facebook daily, and 65% of our monthly actives are daily actives.
Several products in the Facebook app are reaching global scale, too, now with more than 450 million people using Events each month and more than 850 million people using Groups. And when it comes to time spent across Facebook, Messenger and Instagram, people are now spending more than 46 minutes per day on average, and that doesn't include WhatsApp.
Our business performance has grown with our community. This quarter, our total revenue is more than $4 billion for the first time, and advertising revenue grew by 43% year-over-year. These results reflect the ongoing investments and improvements we've made and the quality, performance and usefulness of our services, and continuing to make progress here remains our biggest priority.
Now, with that in mind, I'd like to talk about how we're working on this across our current product, our next generation of apps and our long-term innovation efforts. Over the next few years, our main focus is on helping our existing communities and businesses reach their full potential. An important part of our strategy is continuing to deliver great experiences across all our products. This means improving the speed and reliability of our apps and building new infrastructure to support our global scale, like our new data center in Texas.
Over the last six months, we've improved the performance of our core app, reducing crashes on iOS by more than 30% and some Android phones by more than 40%. On Messenger, people can now send messages up to 20% faster, and it's twice as fast when you start the app. These are just a few examples of how our engineering focus is delivering better experiences for everyone in our community.
Another part of delivering great experiences is helping people connect to the content they want. This quarter, we've continued to focus on improving people's experience in News Feed by making it easier to find more relevant and engaging content from friends and the entire community. Connecting people with more great video content is an important part. Video continues to be some of the richest and most engaging content for people and publishers, and since the start of the year, pages are also sharing more than 40% more videos. This quarter, we updated our News Feed ranking to help people see more of the videos they care about and also began testing new options for video monetization to help our partners build their businesses. We're excited about the potential for continued work here.
The focus we've had on video also supports our efforts to connect more people around important public moments and events. From the 59 million people who generated more than 300 million interactions around the Copa America to the 26 million people who changed their profile photos for Pride or the more than 150 million people who were notified that their friends were safe after the Nepal earthquake. Facebook has clearly become the home for global conversations about things that people care about.
And when it comes to serving businesses on our platform, this quarter, we continued to focus on delivering more useful tools and resources to help them achieve their goals. Helping marketers to tell more visually engaging stories through video and carousel ads is an important focus, as well as supporting small businesses. There are now more than 40 million small and medium-size businesses, using pages on Facebook. So we have a big opportunity to create value for communities all over the world, and Sheryl is going to talk more about this in a moment.
Next, let's talk about how we're building our next generation of services, which we also expect to be important parts of our business over the next few years. With Instagram, the continued growth in the size and engagement of the community shows how this is becoming one of the best places to get a real-time snapshot of the world. For moments from the U.S. presidential campaign trail to NASA's first photos from Pluto, people are using Instagram in a lot of interesting ways. This quarter, we made some big improvements to the app, including upgrading our search and explore functionality and introducing trending content, which we expect will provide even more engaging experiences.
On Messenger, this quarter, we rolled out a number of new features, including mobile video calling, a new way to share locations and the option to sign up for Messenger without using a Facebook account. We also continue to make good progress building out the Messenger platform. We expect these improvements to continue making Messenger a more useful and engaging experience for lots of people. More than 700 million people now use Messenger and we've reached more than $1 billion downloads on Android. These milestones are a good sign that we're on the right path here.
With WhatsApp, we're pleased with our continued growth, and the team is continuing to roll out new features to serve the whole community. We've continued to improve the web experience for WhatsApp as well as launching voice calling to more people and on more devices.
With Search, we are continuing to build a better experience for our whole community. We recently crossed 1.5 billion searches per day, and we've now indexed more than two trillion posts. This is a huge set of unique experiences and perspectives, and by allowing people to unlock this knowledge, we have a huge opportunity to create value for the world in the coming years.
Finally, let's talk about our other efforts that we expect to deliver impact over the longer term. With Internet.org, we have a lot of momentum with our goal of connecting everyone in the world to the Internet. A year ago, we launched the Internet.org app for the first time in Zambia. And since then, we've made free basic Internet services available to more than 1 billion people in 17 countries. Our results show that Internet.org is working. After launching free basic services, mobile operators are seeing people adopt mobile data 50% faster than before. And more than half the new people coming online through Internet.org choose to pay for data and access, more Internet services within their first 30 days.
We recently made changes to the Internet.org program for both developers and operators that will give more people access to even more free services. With the Internet.org platform, now it's easy for any developer to create services that integrate with Internet.org. And just this week, we announced a portal for operators that makes it easy for them to quickly launch free basic services in new countries.
We're also making progress on our efforts to connect people living in some of the most remote communities on earth. Our Connectivity Lab is working on new technologies for connecting communities, that include drones satellites and laser communication systems, and we'll be sharing more of our progress here very soon.
And with Oculus, we've announced that the Rift will ship to consumers in the first quarter of 2016. The team recently introduced details about the full hardware and software experience that people can expect, including our new touch controllers. Oculus is going to be the best VR experience in the world when it launches and I'm really excited for us to begin to delivering on the promise of virtual reality.
S that's how we've focused our efforts over the last quarter. We're preparing for the future, but we're also working to deliver better experiences and value to our community today. And as usual, I want to thank our whole community, including our employees, our shareholders and our partners. Thanks to you, our community is getting stronger and stronger every day and we're making progress on our mission to make the world more open and connected.
So thank you. And now here's Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Thanks, Mark. And hi, everyone. We had another strong quarter and a great first half of the year. Ad revenue grew 43% year-over-year, 55% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue grew 74% year-over-year, making it over three-quarters of total ad revenue. Our growth was broad-based across all marketer segments and industry verticals. Similar to Q1, we're pleased with the adoption of our ad products across all regions and we saw strong revenue growth in North America and Asia-Pacific in particular. We're staying focused on our three main priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of Facebook marketers and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People are spending more time on their mobile devices and on Facebook apps. We continue to get more than one out of every five minutes on smartphones in the U.S. and mobile usage is driving our growth globally as well. We believe we have the best performing mobile ad product in the market and video's making it even better. With so many consumer videos being watched on Facebook, video ads are a natural part of the News Feed experience. For marketers, video has always been a compelling format. Now Facebook enables mass reach and cross device targeting and measurement abilities far superior to what other platforms offer. Mobile video was a major theme at the Cannes Lions Festival last month, where some of the biggest winners, like Under Armour's I WILL WHAT I WANT with Droga5, and Procter & Gamble's Like a Girl with Leo Burnett used mobile video on Facebook as part of their campaign.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. In Q2, we announced that 40 million small and medium businesses have active Facebook pages, and this number continues to grow. Earlier this month, I hosted SMB roundtables in Berlin and London. I got to hear firsthand how advertising on Facebook is helping SMBs sell their products, grow their businesses, hire new employees and even expand to other cities and countries. One of the business owners I met was Kelly Wright (11:43), a single mom who started selling dresses from her home. She began by shooting videos of her dresses on her mobile phone and promoting them on Facebook for just a few pounds. Using Facebook as her only marketing channel, Kelly grew her business, Krista Lee Fashion, (11:59) to over £3 million pounds annually and she now has 10 employees.
We're increasing our engagement with the global SMB community and have now held more than 80 local Boost Your Business events around the world, meeting thousands of businesses and getting their feedback on how we can make our products work better for them. We're also building out our leadership teams around the world. In recent weeks we've added senior talent to our international teams, including a new head of Latin America and new regional leadership in several countries in EMEA. We also opened an office in Johannesburg, our first in Africa.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Better, more engaging and relevant ads are good for people and marketers, and we're working hard to improve them. We continue to innovate at a rapid pace by introducing new ad formats and new tools for marketers. This quarter we expanded carousel ads, which show multiple images in one ad unit. We introduced dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to upload their product catalog and show the right product to the right person at the right time. We also introduced a new ad format called Lead Ads, a simpler way for people to connect with companies they're interested in hearing from.
We continue to focus on providing world-class products and tools for direct response advertisers. Booking.com, a Priceline Group company, is using Facebook link ads featuring Book Now button to drive reservations. In Q2, Facebook ads drove a meaningful increase in room reservations for Booking.com, helping them meet their ROI goals for the campaign. They're now expanding their use of Facebook ads across multiple markets.
We continue to make progress with ads on Instagram. In Q2, we launched Instagram ads in Brazil, Germany and Japan. We also introduced additional capabilities for marketers, including carousel ads on Instagram, which brands are using in creative ways. For example, to showcase a spring fashion collection, gradually reveal a full panorama or show different views of a location. Over the coming months, Instagram ads will be available to more advertisers with new formats, better targeting and the ability to buy online as well as through third-party planners. As we ramp Instagram ads, we remain focused on quality and relevance to ensure the best experience for people and the highest performance for marketers. And as always, our highest focus is on the consumer experience with Instagram.
Measurement is a key priority as we work to expand our share of global marketing budgets. Since we introduced conversion lift, which measures the direct impact that Facebook ads have on sales, we've seen adoption for marketers across verticals. When Acura launched the TLX, the largest launch in their history, they used Facebook video to show the TLX in scenarios that quickly captured people's attention, like imitating a roller coaster. They then used our retargeting technology to show more detailed ads only to the people who watched the videos. Using conversion lift, they proved that Facebook ads directly drove vehicle sales.
To help marketers target and measure campaigns both on and off Facebook, we're continuing to build out our ad tech platform with Atlas LiveRail on the Audience Network. Entertainment company Live Nation knew that people browsed for concert tickets on mobile devices, but they were never able to measure whether they converted into sales. Using Atlas, Live Nation was able to link their mobile ads to 66% more ticket purchases for one of their largest artists. This shows the promise of Atlas to measure cross device conversion. We're pleased with the progress we're making on all three of our main priorities and we plan to stay focused.
Now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $4 billion in revenue and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. Strong community growth and engagement underpinned our financial performance. In June, approximately 968 million people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.49 billion people who used Facebook during the month of June. That MAU number grew by 173 million year-over-year, and by this measure the second quarter was our strongest in terms of community growth since 2013.
Mobile remains the key driver of our growth. In June, approximately 1.31 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year. We also saw strong growth in our next generation of services with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp now exceeding 300 million, 700 million and 800 million MAU respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles. Total revenue was $4 billion, up 39%, or 50% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue was $3.8 billion, up 43%, or 55% on a constant currency basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q2 2014 levels, our total revenue this quarter would have been approximately $330 million higher.
Regionally, we saw strong North American ad revenue growth of 55% in the quarter, and APAC growth also remained strong at 48%. Europe and the rest of the world ad revenue grew more slowly at 30% and 22% respectively, as currency had a significant negative impact on each of those regions' year-over-year growth rates. Mobile is the engine of our revenue growth. Mobile ad revenue in Q2 was $2.9 billion, up 74% from last year, and represents 76% of our advertising revenue. Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down approximately 8%. In Q2, the average price per ad increased 220% while total ad impressions declined 55%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right hand column ads, which rolled out in the third quarter of last year. To a lesser degree, the shift of usage towards mobile, where we don't have right hand column ads, also contributed to the reported price volume trends.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $215 million, down 8% compared to last year. The decline was driven by a 19% year-over-year reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers, offset primarily by the addition of other revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q2 total GAAP expenses were $2.8 billion, up 82%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.8 billion, up 57%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expense growth was primarily driven by increases in head count-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. We ended the quarter with 10,955 employees, up 52% compared to last year. With 873 additional employees, Q2 was one of our strongest quarters in terms of hiring, and the majority of the new employees were added in R&D.
Our Q2 GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 31% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, representing a 55% margin. Our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 44% and 36%, respectively. Q2 GAAP net income was $719 million or $0.25 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $1.4 billion or $0.50 per share. In Q2, capital expenditures were $549 million and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $14.1 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. Let's start with revenue. Since the first quarter of 2014, we have seen year-over-year advertising revenue growth rates decline each subsequent quarter. We expect this trend to continue in Q3 and Q4 as we continue to grow off a much larger base and face currency headwinds due to the strong dollar. In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenues to decline on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of the year. The decline in the second half of the year should be closer to the 19% year-over-year decline we experienced in the Payments business alone as we will be lapping periods in which we added other fees revenue from acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
Turning to expense guidance. Based on our second-quarter results, we are narrowing the expense guidance range for 2015. We now expect the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 GAAP expenses to be between 55% and 60%, narrowed from the prior range of 55% to 65%. And we expect the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 non-GAAP expenses to be between 50% and 55%, narrowed from the prior range of 50% to 60%.
We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down slightly from the prior range of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion. We continue to expect stock-based compensation in 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses in 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And lastly, we anticipate our Q3 and full year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be consistent with the rates in the second quarter.
We had a great first half of the year with solid revenue performance underpinned by healthy community growth across all of our services and regions. We have many exciting opportunities ahead, and we are investing in the talent and resources to capitalize on them as we seek to build long-term shareholder value.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now open the lines for the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Thanks a lot. I have one for Mark and one for Dave. Mark, Facebook has had so much success in terms of the engagement, the growth of the engagement. I'm just wondering if there's a framework that you used to think about how much of that success is due to just the core value proposition of Facebook itself continuing to resonate with people at its most basic level as opposed to the product innovation that you've detailed in your prepared remarks or in your use cases? Which are more of a driver in your mind?
And then second one for Dave. CapEx being down as a percentage of revenue in 2Q and you lowered the guidance. It doesn't feel like you guys are in the midst of ramping investment in the infrastructure. I wonder, as you look at the assets, you have so much growth, you have a shift to bandwidth intensive content and applications. Do you feel like you guys have just been more efficient in terms of your CapEx spend, or at some point should we anticipate a reacceleration of CapEx? Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I can talk to the first part. So at some level, I do think that the core mission and promise of helping to connect people with their friends and family is very fundamental, right? And everyone has friends and family and wants to stay connected and uses a variety of tools and ways to do that in the world today, which are often very inefficient, and the Internet offers new opportunities to make that a lot better. When you look at the specific products that – and the work that we're doing, there's this process that we've followed that – where basically we'll look at an area of our products that people are using. So for example, going back a few years, News Feed, right, was – it's always been, since we rolled it out, a very central part of the product.
But we're looking at the stuff with increasing rigor now where we organized the company into these product groups, and each product group leader will not just look at the product as one thing, but what are the key three or four or five use cases which often can really be their own product lines on their own, and we go through and we build those out to be world-class. And I think a lot of the success that we've seen has been because of some of the work that we've done a few years back at this point in products like News Feed and I mean that team has executed really well.
But when I look forward, I'm very excited about doing the same thing for messaging and groups and video. There's many different use cases. You don't want to just look at these as one thing. There are a bunch of different use cases, and we want to be the best at each of them. And if you have good people leading those teams, then I think you can deliver that over time. So I think yes is the answer to your question. The mission is fundamentally deeply important to people, but that has to be coupled with good thorough execution of each of the available opportunities.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Anthony. It's Dave. So on CapEx, we are absolutely investing in the infrastructure and 2015 is an investment year, so we are ramping CapEx versus 2014. The guidance is $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and that's up from $1.8 billion last year. We've got a lot of infrastructure investment that we're making across data centers, servers, network. We are clearly investing for the growth of both Facebook at its core and then also the additional services that we're bringing on.
So we're proud about the efficiencies that we've had. The infrastructure team has done an outstanding job in driving good efficiencies through things like the Open Compute Project, which allows us to leverage an open-source strategy to lower our costs on server and other expensive hardware. It's been a great strategy for us. But given the growth we have in the business, given the opportunity we have before us, we're very much in investment mode in terms of the infrastructure.

Your next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Mark, you talked about Oculus Rift shipping in 1Q 2016. Can you talk more about what you're most excited about in terms of the primary applications when it's into the mainstream? And then, Dave, can you also help us understand the cost structure more here as that product ramps? And then, Sheryl, if you could help us understand how broadly Instagram will open up to advertisers by year end? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I can talk about Oculus. So the reason why Facebook is excited in this space is I can give you two reasons for this. One is there's this continued progression of people getting richer and richer ways to share what's on their minds. So if you go back 10 years, most of how people communicated and shared was text. We are going through a period where now it's mostly visual and photos. We are entering into a period where that's going to increasingly be primarily video, and we're seeing huge growth there. But that's not the end of the line. I mean, there's always a richer way that people want to share and consume thoughts and ideas and I think that immersive 3D content is the obvious next thing after video.
So if you look at what the initial use cases are going to be around that, I think it's a lot of the stuff that you hear people talking about. Video I think will be huge. So just taking that to be 3D and immersive. Gaming will be huge. And those are both areas that Facebook has been involved with. Once we start to get more of a critical mass, I think you can start to get social applications, which is what we as a company are more interested in over the long term and think have a huge amount of potential in addition to the video and gaming stuff, which I just think is going to be awesome in the next few years as well.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Doug. It's Dave. So just on the question of how Oculus would affect the cost structure, it's premature for us to be giving guidance on the cost structure in 2016. But I think one of the things to recognize here is that we're still early with Oculus. We haven't announced any specific plans as it relates to shipment volumes for the consumer for Rift. But we are still early in the development stage, so it'd be early to be talking about large volume shipments. Obviously, we're investing on the research and development side on Oculus in 2015 and that's factored into our expense guidance for this year.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On Instagram, we are opening up to more advertisers. I talked about some of our global rollouts in the past quarter. We're also opening up more capabilities, which means more formats, like direct response, more ways to buy, like self-serve. That said, and it's important to understand this, while we think there's a lot of interest and great opportunity, we're going to be really thoughtful and strategic about how we ramp revenue. Instagram remains small relative to Facebook and it's going to really take time to have significant impact on our growth.

Your next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about as you start to speak with more advertisers on the Instagram opportunity, how are you and they thinking about the differences in how they'll engage with their customers across both platforms? And I guess what I'm getting at is do you see Instagram targeting a different type of advertiser, or do you expect people to leverage both platforms and almost think of them as kind of separate areas to budget for?
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
I think one of the things that's interesting about Instagram is while the ads are really visually appealing and that brings to mind certain verticals like fashion or autos, things where the visual really matters, what we're seeing is that lots of different verticals can use the platform really well. So a recent example, HTC working with their agency Swift did Instagram videos to raise awareness of their mobile device warranty program. So they targeted 18- to 34-year olds, they did five short videos with these funny moments of where you're about to break your phone, and they got a 6 point lift in awareness of what is a warranty program. I think that's not something you would think of typically as Instagram.
In terms of Instagram and Facebook, we believe that marketers are looking to connect with people in a really deep way, connect with the right people, and our targeting we think is really strong compared to any other platform, at the right time. And that really means mobile. And we see such engagement on both Facebook and Instagram along with the different targeting and ad formats, we believe we'll be able to have and are already starting to have a relationship with marketers which grow across both platforms.
Our focus with our marketing partners is their business results. I talked about in my remarks how we're looking for conversions. We're trying to help them measure. If you do a car ad for us, how many vehicles were driven off the lot? We see what products you use within Facebook or Instagram, or Facebook and Instagram, as less important as the best products for the right marketer at the right time to drive their business results. And we like having more abilities, more products, more apps to work with so that we can drive those business results.

Your next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my question. There are two. In early June you rolled out some new CPC measurement methods about how the changes in the clicks and the CPCs are measured. Just being curious about kind of early findings you see in ad engagement growth, average price per ad, and then the advertiser feedback or change in budgeting since you've rolled out these CPC measurement changes? And then the second one, the North American advertising results are really strong, I think you had accelerating growth. Sheryl, could you just call out any specific ad products that are driving this faster North American ad growth? Thanks.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On the first, we're always trying to improve our ad products so marketers can buy what they want and pay as they want to pay. We recently announced that we're updating the definition of CPC so that includes only websites and apps. But you can also buy on a cost per engagement basis, and that include likes, comments, and shares. It's too early to see any direct impact, but I think it's part of the innovation that you'll see from us as we continue to roll out different ways that marketers can use our tools, different ways they can pay, different results they can target. When you look at our overall growth, our growth is very broad-based. We're broad-based against all of our segments of marketers, so brand and direct response, SMBs and developers.
Definitely a part of the story here is video. Our video demand is very deep. People love the format of video. It's long been used to reach people in a compelling way, and we can do targeting in a way that's really unique. So I'll share another example. Wendy's, working with their agency, VML, launched their Jalapeno Fresco Spicy Chicken product and they were trying to reach millennials and spicy food lovers. So working with us, they did five video ads, and on our platform, they could not just do the video format but they could target millennials and people who like spicy food, which is very specific targeting. They got an eight-point lift in ad recall and a four-point lift in purchase intent among their millennial target. And so what that shows is our growth is being driven by the ability of us to do this broad-based consumer media advertising but do it in a more targeted way.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. And I think, Brian, you were also commenting on North America. Obviously, it's probably, everybody realizes this, but the big disparity between the U.S.-Canada growth rates versus the other regions like Europe and the rest of world are the currency headwinds, which had a very significant impact to the year-over-year advertising growth rates in those regions.

Oh, great. Thank you. A couple of questions on video. Mark, I think you mentioned potentially some new options for video monetization. Maybe could you discuss some of the new options that we may see implemented? And just more broadly, how does video content evolve on Facebook from kind of what we see today? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I can talk – oh, you want...
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
You can go first.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mean, on the options on video monetization, it's going to be, still our focus is going to be on continuing to grow autoplay and continuing to leverage the video unit in News Feed. That's going to be the primary driver of video growth for us. So that's really the main focus. We've got other areas that we're experimenting with like suggested videos, which are going to be very much like those ads in a feed of suggested videos, which are also an opportunity for us. But essentially, the focus is going to be on monetizing through feed ads for video.

Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Great. Thank you. I think on the call, you said times spent was 46 minutes per day. Any comparable metric from past quarters? And then how would you, if you can give us that, how would you gauge the overall engagement of Facebook just for the core site? Maybe some help about what you're seeing there and what products are really having an impact. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think in terms of engagement the product is having, the biggest impact is News Feed continuing to do very well. So News Feed at the core is proving to be just a great experience for users. It's getting better. We continue to invest in that. As people spend more time with News Feed, we get better about understanding what they like and getting the content that they care about in front of them. So we're investing on that front. We're also doing more with public content. That's having an impact. So we're seeing across the board good improvements to News Feed. Video is another big contributor there as well.
So, I mean, that's what we're seeing in terms of driving engagement. Engagement across the different regions as we think about it from a DAU-to-MAU perspective was at record levels in the quarter, so we're pleased with that. And we continue to see time spent grow across the platform. So on all those measures, we really like what we're seeing and we like the investments that we're making to make that News Feed experience even better.

Your next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. I just had two questions, one for Mark and then one clarification for Dave. Mark, question on the messaging app. So the (37:37) from the first day keynote at the end of the day, Brian Acton and David Marcus were basically presenting different strategies in terms of their long-term philosophy around monetization of those two platforms.
So if you look out three or five years, do you see the opportunity with Messenger and WhatsApp as being similar or can you just talk about the strategy there? And is the engagement for the messaging apps similar, higher, lower than the average for the core Facebook app in terms of daily visits? And then, Dave, you mentioned that you expect ad revenue to decelerate. I'm guessing that's a function of some of the FX headwinds. Can you talk about that on a currency neutral basis relative to the 55% in the second quarter? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. I can take the second part first. So in terms of – also you had asked about the growth rate in the back half of the year, so I'd kind of reiterate what I said in my comments. The business continues to perform very well, driven off the strength of our mobile News Feed apps business, and really consistent with the trend we've seen in the last several quarters, we would expect that year-over-year ads growth rate to decline modestly in Q3 and Q4, and it's really because we're delivering growth against a much larger scale News Feed business in the prior-year period and also, of course, headwinds are an impact as well, as you mentioned.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And I can talk to the messaging strategy question. So the playbook that we're going to run with Messenger and WhatsApp is kind of similar to how we thought about building a business in Facebook and News Feed, where if you go back to 2006 and 2007, there were a lot of people who were kind of encouraging us to just put banner ads and kind of inorganic content into the experience, and what we decided was that over the long term, the ads and monetization would perform better if there was an organic interaction between people using the product and businesses.
So instead of focusing on ads first, what we did was we built pages, and we made that free, that way as many businesses as possible could get into the network. And we built insights to make it so that businesses knew how they were driving business when they used pages for free and could post them to News Feed. And then on top of that whole ecosystem, we then had the opportunity to build what has turned into a News Feed business that we're really proud of, right. That we think is driving a lot of value and good content for people who are using the platform and helping a lot of businesses find customers and sell their products and grow overall.
Messaging, I think, is going to be pretty similar, right? Where right now some people in WhatsApp use the service in order to message businesses, Messenger is, I think, more people-to-people today. We're working on a lot of different things that make it so that people can get value from interacting with businesses. We launched some of them at F8. We have a number of other things that we're working on across Messenger and WhatsApp. But the long term bet is that by enabling people to have good organic interactions with businesses, that will end up being a massive multiplier on the value of the monetization down the road when we work on that and really focus on that in a bigger way. So we'd ask for some patience on this to do this correctly, and the game plan will be more similar to what we did in Facebook with News Feed.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
And, Ross, you also asked about, I think, the impact of Messenger on our user statistics and the daily users. The vast, vast majority, virtually all of Messenger users, are using News Feed as well. So Messenger-only usage is not having a material impact on our overall usage stats.

Your next question is from Mark May with Citi. Your line is open.
Mark May - Citi Investment Research
Thanks for taking my questions. I had one on search. I think you mentioned 1.5 billion daily searches. Just kind of curious what portion of those are commercial, if you will, not so much lookups for friends and family but more commercial oriented, and kind of can you give us an update of where you are in the process of building out an even more robust search experience on Facebook and across the other family of apps?
And then on Instagram, just a question on kind of how we should be thinking about the ramp as well as the long term opportunity. I guess the question would be in your tests, have you noticed any meaningful difference in Instagram users' willingness to see or interact with ads and their News Feed as compared with an average Facebook user, recognizing that probably Instagram's audience is more geared toward some of the developing markets in the U.S. relative to Facebook? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. On the search experience, and Mark can add anything if he'd like, but on the search experience from a monetization perspective, the vast majority of the searches are for people or posts, and there can be – there's the potential for there to be commercially relevant content in people's posts, people searches, which is the largest part of searching, is not something that we think is really up the monetizing category. But there's certainly great content that people are finding using post search, but it's really – the focus is really to try and allow people to discover content that's been shared on Facebook that's relevant to them, and that's going to be the focus in the near term. And as people consume more content on Facebook, there's opportunities to show them ads in Feed, so there's an opportunity there, but it's really around engaging with content that you want to find on Facebook.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On Instagram, we haven't noticed any difference in willingness to engage with ads between the platforms for Instagram and Facebook, but we've ramped really slowly and we're very, very cautious. And again, we're going to continue to focus on the user experience, focus on the community growth and monetization will follow.

Yeah, just a couple of questions. One, given your success with standalone apps, should we expect to see more apps in the future, and could one of those focus specifically on video?

Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thanks. Two questions. David, the sales and marketing expenses this quarter were almost flattish sequentially. You don't normally see that in your business. Is there anything, any particular reason behind that why you didn't have that area grow? I assume it will continue to grow going forwards.
And then, Mark, you made a comment about. I think you were referring to Instagram becoming one of the best places to get a real-time snapshot of the world. And it kind of reminds me or makes me think about some other leading platforms on the Internet. And I wonder how does that happen with Instagram? Is that something that you're already seeing users use Instagram to make that happen? Or is that something that you have to kind of tweak the user interface and change the product a little bit in order to try to have people think about it that way? How does it become that real-time snapshot of the world? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
So on the sales and marketing expenses, Mark, I think you're going to see that be lumpy. That's just due to product marketing and that's just not going to necessarily be a steady quarter-to-quarter trend. So you're going to see that be lumpy. But, yes, we are investing more in general in sales and marketing over time, so you'd expect to see that line grow in line with the expense guidance that we're giving. So it's definitely an area that we'll be investing in on an ongoing basis and I wouldn't read too much into the quarterly trend there.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, and in terms of Instagram, I just think Kevin and the team are doing amazing work. The clarity of focus and clarity of the vision that Kevin and Mike have has been exceptional. And this is something that they've always focused on. They've cared deeply about it since the first conversations I've had with Kevin. And I think it takes real composure as a leader to scale something to many x where it was just a few years ago and build up the organization and be able to continue pushing the products forward every day to be able to do that. And I think it's rare that you get someone who's as talented as the folks who are leading this. And they're just doing an amazing job.

Great. Thanks. Kind of a similar follow-up question to Mark's. Your DAU to MAU number has been exceptionally strong and moving up. I'm going to guess a lot of that is mobile related. So I guess that would be question number one. Is it a lot mobile?
And the second question would be sort of again around this real-time issue. Are you seeing more real-time usage of Facebook and are you developing more products specifically around kind of real-time usage of Facebook as a platform? Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think a lot of it is that we're getting better and better at ranking and showing people the content they want. And part of it is that there's of course a bigger opportunity when people have their phones with them all the time, but I think that there are plenty of other worlds that we could be living in where we wouldn't have necessarily executed on that opportunity. And the execution is hard, right? And just kind of having something that's appealing universally to people wanting to stay connected with their friends, that's an important piece of it. But I mean, the team has just done really good work in terms of ranking the content and making the experience faster and building out better ways to get feedback from our community on what kinds of content they want to see in News Feed and helping people have the tools that they need to share the social content and news and video content that they want so that way it exists in the corpus of content that can be shown. And I just think the team is doing a really good work on all of these, and I'm really proud of them.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
And, Paul, there's no doubt that mobile has a beneficial effect on our engagement in the U.S. Two out of three smartphone users check their phone as soon as they wake up in the morning. It's just having that experience readily available in your pocket is tremendous, and we just see that being helpful across the business as it relates to mobile engagement.

Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned 40 million small businesses have active Pages. I'm wondering if you could update us on how many individual small businesses, or businesses in total are buying ads right now?
And separately, I was curious about your current thoughts on how ad tech businesses will evolve. If you see integrated marketplace evolving, or if you see a discreet demand in supply-side businesses evolving?
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
So on the first, we announced that we have over 2 million advertisers who are buying ads on Facebook. And the process for that is often that small businesses become organic users, so those 40 million small business Pages that are using it once a month and then we're able to move them onto being advertisers. And the best way we've done that is by simplified ad products. 82% of people who start advertising with us start with our really simple ad products. You know, do you want to pay a few dollars or a few pounds or a few euro to sponsor this post is a really easy on-ramp for a small business.
In terms of overall ad tech world, I think a lot is happening and there's a lot that's going to evolve in the whole ecosystem. Our focus is on bringing people-based marketing and the effectiveness and relevance of Facebook ads off of Facebook so we can give marketers and publishers the tools to reach people across all of their devices.
An importantly for our business, is connect the dots between online marketing and business outcomes. And you heard on this call me give a few examples of where we're already able to connect what happens in terms of ads with real sales of real products. For us, this is an important investment and it's very strategic. We are going to put the time in to make this work rather than look for any short-run specific return.

Your next question is from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line's open.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Drafting off that. Sheryl, I'm wondering if you could update us on Atlas. We understand Atlas in and of itself is not likely be a major revenue driver, but we do see it as a strategically important piece of your toolset. So wondering if you can comment on agency adoption. Is it going according to plan? Are you happy with it?
And then secondly, on SMB, just wondering, the 80 events that you've held around the world. In terms of learning come out of those, you talked a little bit about how folks get introduced as users, and that makes sense. Is the toolset simple enough today for SMB's to grasp? Or are there significant additions that you need to make to the toolset to accelerate the growth of SMB advertisers? Thanks very much.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
So on the first, Atlas is really important because it's solving a measurement problem which is that the current systems for serving and measuring ads are really flawed. They basically assume that you are one person on one of device, and we know that's not true. They are only about 65% accurate in demographic targeting, they don't work on mobile because they are cookie based, they don't work on multiple devices, they don't go off-line to on-line and they overemphasize the last click and reach.
And so our focus with Atlas is helping people really understand the results they get with ads. And you heard my Live Nation example earlier where we are able to connect Facebook ads and our platform directly to ticket sales. We never could have done that without Atlas measurements.
In terms of the migration process, this is an enterprise sale. We have to work client by client. Then they have to choose us, then they have to migrate their systems, and so it's going to take time. What really matters is that when we get that migration and we are seeing it, we are able to show them the value because it makes their buying much more effective because they understand real results in a new way.
In tune with SMBs I would say two things. I would say that, one, our products aren't simple enough yet, because they can never be simple enough for SMBs, but two, our products are probably the simplest ones out there. And so I think we're leading and I think we have a lot more to do. If we look at even in the United States, which is a very advanced market, I think it's something like 35% of SMBs don't have a web presence of any kind. But a great majority of those do have a Facebook page, and that's because setting up a web presence for an SMB is complicated and expensive. You can't just start a webpage. But it is easier and free to start a Facebook page until you see broad adoption.
We also make a lot of things that they couldn't do in other platforms available on us. So over 1 million SMBs have posted a video on Facebook, which is pretty amazing, because I doubt 1 million SMBs have ever run what is a video or TV ad. That's because you can shoot it on your mobile device, you can upload it, you can do that for free or you can pay us for the ad. And so I think our tools are the simplest, but I think we still need to do better because what we hear from SMBs is simple, fast, inexpensive, showing them real return, and we're going to continue to focus on all of those things.

Thanks for taking the questions. I wonder if I could get an update on the e-commerce initiatives including the partnership with Shopify and how we should be thinking longer term about e-commerce becoming a bigger and bigger part of the platform. Sheryl, you called out Priceline.com and the booking relationship during your prepared remarks. Just curious how far that might go longer term. Thanks.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
So e-commerce is one of our top categories of advertisers, and we are already driving a lot of product sales through Facebook but importantly, our e-commerce initiatives are really about connecting consumers with marketers so that they can buy from companies. They're not buying through us. We are testing a buy button in the new shop section on pages, but again, that buy button is letting people buy directly from their advertisers, not from us. It's pretty early days. We're excited by what we see in the e-commerce vertical and we're going to continue to invest in growing that vertical as part of our ads business.

Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Questions on audience network. Any updates here including a sense for the level of adoption you're seeing from developers? Also any synergies with the mobile app install product? And finally any comments on ad price comparisons to traditional News Feed ads? Thanks.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
We're seeing investment, we're investing in the audience network and we think it's important because it takes – it makes the ads more relevant. It's part of our overall ad tech push to bring the effectiveness and relevance of our ads off us. We're growing the number of advertisers and publishers, and we're continuing to see growth and we'll continue to invest.
When you think about mobile app install ads, those are an important but relatively small part of our revenue. The important thing to understand here is that they're not only used by developers, they're used by all four marketer segments. So for example, HBO used our video retargeting mobile app install ads on Facebook to drive downloads at HBO now, and Facebook is now the number one channel driving subscribers. And I think when people think about our mobile app install ads they often think this only applies to developers and small companies, and really it's them as well but it's also companies like HBO which are using those ads to drive adoption and downloads.

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone for joining us today.
This was a good quarter and a good start to the year. We continue to grow the size and engagement of our community, now with 1.44 billion people using Facebook each month and 936 million people daily. We continue to see strong growth in daily engagement around the world, including in our most engaged markets. On mobile, nearly 1.25 billion people now use Facebook every month, 240 million than a year ago, and we now see more than 1 billion mobile searches every day.
Looking at our business, we continue to achieve impressive growth. Total revenue grew by 42% year-over-year, and advertising revenue grew by 46%. Mobile now accounts for 73% of our ads revenue. These results show that we're making progress in our mission to connect the world and we're executing well against our priorities.
But this quarter also shows how Facebook is continuing to make progress for the years ahead. Facebook has evolved from a single blue app on your phone into a family of apps. Now, many of these apps are reaching a global scale. More than 1.4 billion people use the core Facebook service, 800 million also use WhatsApp, 700 million use our Groups product, 600 million use Messenger, and on Instagram, there are more than 300 million active members of the community. We're building this family of apps because we want people to be able to share whatever moments they want with all the different sets of people they care about. Over time, we expect people to share richer content with an increasing frequency so we want to continue developing new and better tools to facilitate this expression.
So with that in mind, let's talk about our efforts over the quarter. First, we're working to help people share and connect with all the things they care about today. An important part of our approach is helping our community to connect around important public moments and personalities. Facebook is the largest community of sports fans in the world, with 650 million people connecting to sports pages. For this year's Super Bowl, more than 65 million people generated more than 265 million interactions on Facebook, the highest level of conversation we've seen for a Super Bowl to-date. For the Cricket World Cup, there were more than 700 million interactions by 53 million people, which shows the strength of the global reach of our community.
We're also making good progress with video. We're very pleased with our growth here, and this quarter we reached a new milestone of more than 4 billion daily videos views. We also launched an embedded video player that allows people to watch Facebook videos across the web, and more than 80,000 videos have now been embedded on third-party websites. Spherical videos are going to be supported in News Feed later this year, allowing you to change your viewing angle for a more immersive experience. Supporting new types of content like this is an important part of preparing for the future of how people want to share.
Now, another part of our strategy is helping people connect with businesses. This quarter, we announced that there are now 2 million advertisers on Facebook. This is an important milestone for our community, and we're encouraged that so many businesses are finding value on Facebook. We continue to focus on innovation in our ads business, and Sheryl is going to talk a bit more about that in a moment.
Now, here's how we're working to develop our family of apps so we can give people more options for sharing in different ways. In the future, we expect that people are going to want to share content with their closest friends at an even greater frequency than they do today, so messaging is a big priority for us. Across the Facebook family of apps, our efforts have a lot of momentum. On average, more than 45 billion messages are sent every day. With voice calling, we're also starting to make some good progress. This quarter, we started rolling out Voice over IP calls on WhatsApp to let people call friends for free around the world. And meanwhile, Messenger already accounts for more than 10% of mobile VoIP calls globally.
With WhatsApp, we continue to be pleased with our growth and the team remains very focused on building new features to serve their community and expand. For Messenger, this has been a particularly busy quarter. We launched the Messenger Platform, which allows people to use creative new apps to have richer conversations. We also began rolling out payments on Messenger to give people an easy, secure way to send money to their friends. And we announced a new way for people to communicate with businesses using Messenger. We're really excited by the potential to build Messenger into a service that helps people to express themselves in rich new ways and to access useful services.
With Instagram, our growth remains impressive, and this quarter, we reached a new milestone of more than 200 million daily actives. Growth in Asia, Europe, and Latin America is particularly strong, with our community growing in some countries by more than 100% year-over-year, including Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia. Combined with an average 21 minutes a day that people spend on Instagram, this is a good sign of this community's continuing and growing strength.
Now, let's talk about how we're working with developers. Last month, we held F8, our annual event for the global developer community. Creating the future of sharing isn't something that we can do on our own, but by supporting developers, we can deliver more apps and experiences for our community. At F8, we presented new tools to help developers build, grow, and monetize their apps, including better sharing experiences from apps to Facebook and new analytics to help developers better understand how people are using their services. More than 30 million apps and sites have been built using Facebook developer tools, and last year we drove more than 3.5 billion app installs. We think these improvements are going to create a lot of value for our community.
All right. Finally, let's talk about some of our most long-term innovation efforts. Internet.org, our effort to connect everyone in the world to the Internet, continues to gather momentum. We've now made free basic Internet services available to more than 800 million people in nine countries, including just in this quarter, launching in India, Colombia, Ghana, Guatemala, and the Philippines. More than seven million people who weren't connected to the Internet before now use internet.org to get online. And this year, we expect to connect even more people.
With our efforts in search, AI and Oculus, we're also continuing to build a new generation of Internet services that are more useful, intuitive, and immersive. And over the coming months, we'll have more to share about these.
So that's how we're thinking about innovation and the future of sharing. It's been a busy quarter. In the last few months, I've visited countries in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. In many communities, I've gotten the chance to see how the Internet is changing lives and creating opportunities for people. I've heard from people who can't wait to get access to the same tools that so many of us take for granted. We're making progress on our mission and working to accelerate towards the day when everyone in the world can be connected. Thanks to our entire community and all of our employees, partners, and shareholders for being a part of this journey and for helping to build something great.
Now, here's Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter and a great start to the year. Ad revenue was $3.3 billion, up 46% or 55% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue grew 82% and is now 73% of total ad revenue. Our performance was strong across all marketer segments and we're pleased with the broad-based growth across our industry verticals. From a regional perspective, we saw strong growth in North America and Asia-Pacific, while Latin America and Europe were affected by foreign exchange headwinds and macroeconomic factors. That said, we're pleased with advertiser adoption of our ad products across all regions.
Innovation drives our ads business. It's how we continually improve the quality of our ads, offer new tools to marketers, and build better experiences for the people who use Facebook. We believe that this ability to innovate will continue to drive our business. So today I want to focus on innovation across our three strategic priorities, capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and making our ads more relevant.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Mobile continues to be a great opportunity for us. People continue to be highly engaged with our mobile apps. In the United States, for example, Facebook and Instagram get more than one out of every five minutes spent on mobile. As consumers shift to mobile, businesses are following, and we're focusing on helping them take advantage of this opportunity to use mobile to build their businesses.
Two new products we introduced this quarter are good examples of this. The Mobile Ads Manager app gives marketers the ability to manage their ad campaigns from their mobile devices. It's early, but we're already seeing more marketers managing their activity on mobile. We also launched a page creation tool for feature phones, which has been a big driver of page adoption in high-growth emerging markets where smartphones are less common.
Looking ahead, we believe video will play a significant role in bringing more marketers to mobile. More than 75% of global video views on Facebook occur on mobile, and we believe mobile video will become more important to marketers over time. Lionsgate's Age of Adaline premiere is a great example. To promote the film, Lionsgate targeted young women on Instagram with multiple video ads over the last few weeks. This week, since the film opens on Friday, they are retargeting the audience from the Instagram campaign on Facebook. We expect more marketers to put mobile video at the heart of their campaigns in the future and we're well-positioned to drive this shift.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products and we're making great progress. In Q2 of last year, we shared that we reached 30 million active business Pages on Facebook. This number continues to grow as more and more small businesses are using our Free Pages product, and we remain focused on converting these Page owners into advertisers. One way we're doing this is by providing simple, easy to use products. Over 80% of our new advertisers start with entry level tools like a promoted post or a Page like. We are increasingly focused on making sure these tools work well on mobile. We're also educating marketers on how to use Facebook more effectively. We recently launched two online training resources: Blueprint for large clients and agencies, and Learn How videos for small businesses. These efforts are paying off. In Q1, we announced that we now have over 2 million active advertisers.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant. More relevant ads lead to better returns for marketers and better experiences for people. We're pleased with the increased adoption of our targeting tools like Custom Audiences and Conversion Tracking. In Q1, we introduced Dynamic Product Ads, which allow marketers to launch ads for different audiences. We also introduced carousel ads on Facebook and Instagram, which allow marketers to advertise for specific products. Adoption of our targeting tools and these new ad formats help make our ads more relevant.
We're also focused on insights and measurement. We want to help marketers accurately measure the performance of their campaigns and then apply that learning to improve their returns. In Q1, we released an ad relevance score, a way for marketers to better understand how people respond to their ads. This helps marketers test different types of creative and optimize performance. We also launched Conversion Lift, a tool that scientifically measures how much additional business was driven from Facebook ads. This is important because it shows that ads on mobile can drive sales in retail stores and via other channels.
For example, Cellbes is a women's fashion retailer in Europe. Using Conversion Lift, they proved that ads on Facebook mobile drove sales on desktop and via phone calls to sales reps at their call centers.
On the ad tech side, we're pleased with the results we're driving for advertisers and publishers. A good example of this is Cheetah Mobile. Using native ads from the Audience Network in its apps, the company is getting more than two-times the CPMs compared to other ad networks. We continue to invest in our ad tech platform. At our F8 Developer Conference last month, we made new two important LiveRail announcements that will improve the relevance of ads people see across sites, apps, and devices. We extended LiveRail's video ad platform into in-app mobile display, which will give publishers better ways to manage their ad inventory across devices. We also announced that LiveRail will give publishers access to Facebook's anonymized demographic information, enabling us to serve more relevant ads to people.
We've had a great start to the year and we're really optimistic about what's to come. Our teams are executing well, staying focused on our big priorities and continuing to innovate.
Now, here's Dave.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $3.5 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in free cash flow and continued making investments to position us for both near-term and long-term growth. We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community. In March, 936 million people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of the 1.44 billion people who used Facebook during the month of March.
Mobile remains the key driver of our growth. In March, approximately 1.25 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 24% from last year. In addition to Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp continue to grow, exceeding 300 million, 600 million, and 800 million MAU, respectively.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, as a reminder, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
Total revenue was $3.5 billion, up 42% or 49% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue was $3.3 billion, up 46% or 55% on a constant currency basis. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the past year had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q1 2014 levels, our total revenue this quarter would have been approximately $190 million higher.
Regionally, we saw strong North American ad revenue growth of 53% in the quarter, second only to APAC, which grew 57%. Europe and the rest of world revenue grew more slowly at 35% and 32%, respectively, with currency impacts leading to a significant reduction in these regions' year-over-year growth rates.
Mobile ad revenue in Q1 was $2.4 billion, up from approximately $1.3 billion last year. Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down approximately 4% and we continue to see overall usage on PCs decline. In Q1, the average price per ad increased 285% while total ad impressions declined 62%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand column ads, which rolled out in the third quarter of last year. To a lesser degree, the shift of usage towards mobile, where we don't have right-hand column ads, also contributed to the reported price volume trends.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $226 million, down 5% compared to last year, a trend we expect to continue. The decline was driven by the year-over-year reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q1 total GAAP expenses were $2.6 billion, up 83%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.7 billion, up 57%. Similar to last quarter, stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year-over-year growth in GAAP expenses. Non-GAAP expense growth was primarily driven by increases in head count-related costs, cost of revenue, and marketing expenses. We ended Q1 with 10,082 employees, up 48% compared to last year. We remain very pleased with our ability to attract and retain top-tier talent.
Q1 operating income was $933 million, representing a 26% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.8 billion, representing a 52% margin. Our Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 45% and 35%, respectively. Q1 GAAP net income was $512 million or $0.18 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion or $0.42 per share. In Q1, capital expenditures were $502 million and we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. Let's start with revenue. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the past year reduced our Q1 total revenue growth rate by 7 percentage points, or approximately $190 million. The dollar strengthened over the course of the quarter and, in the month of March, our year-over-year total revenue growth rate was approximately 10% lower than it would have been in constant currency terms. Based on this, we estimate that foreign exchange headwinds in Q2 will likely be greater than those we experienced in Q1. In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees revenue to decline on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of the year.
Turning to expense guidance. We are tightening our expense guidance range modestly based on better visibility into our annual spending. We expect that the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 GAAP expenses will be in the range of 55% to 65%, as compared to our prior guidance of 55% to 70%. We expect that the year-over-year growth rate for total 2015 non-GAAP expenses will be in the range of 50% to 60% as compared to our prior guidance of 50% to 65%.
Our expense outlook reflects the broad range of investments that we're making in both our services and infrastructure as we continue to enhance the core experiences on Facebook and Instagram, grow our messaging products, strengthen our advertising business globally and invest in long-term growth areas like Oculus and internet.org. The remainder of our guidance remains unchanged. We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the neighborhood of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion. We expect stock-based compensation in 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp.
We expect amortization expenses in 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And lastly, we anticipate our Q2 and full-year 2015 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be consistent with the rates in the first quarter.
In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year for Facebook. We're very pleased with the growth of our community, the strength of our business, and the investments we're making to build long-term shareholder value.
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We'll now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. The first one, I guess, can you talk a little about early advertiser and publisher feedback from the LiveRail in-app mobile product and what are some areas where you see potential for improvements to drive faster adoption? And then on the OpEx side, I appreciate you're tightening the range. Can you help us at all on expectations for head count growth this year and what are the biggest areas you see investing in incremental employees this year?
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
So, on LiveRail, we're pleased with the performance and the changes we've been able to make. Video is obviously super important so having the ability to do – work on video across the web has been really great. And then at F8 we made two more announcements that I mentioned. What we're hearing from publishers is that this is a good opportunity and they're pleased with the extensions we're making because it can make their ad serving and buying more efficient across the platforms they use.
In terms of areas for improvement, I think there's a lot we can do. I think have you to look at our ad tech investments very holistically from Atlas to LiveRail to the Audience Network. These are all different pieces of the ad tech but what they're all working on is taking the relevance and the ability to do people-based marketing and make that available to work on Facebook but also off Facebook. We believe that because we can do marketing to people and then measure results across what people do in privacy-protective ways, we have an ability to improve the relevance of marketing which will make it better for consumers and increase returns for marketers.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
And Brian, it's Dave. Just on the OpEx question, I think the key is that we're investing in our near, mid-term, and long-term priorities, so in the near-term we're investing to grow the community, execute on the existing business, both on the product side and then the advertising and sales force side. And in the mid-term, we're building out those next-generation of services to be great businesses that reach their full potential, so that's Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger. And then in the long-term, we're investing in areas like the next-generation computing platform, internet.org, AI.
In general, I would say our head count growth has skewed towards the R&D side because a lot of these initiatives have long-term development needs. So we've been investing there. But we are investing across the board. In terms of a specific head count guidance, I would just stick with our expense guidance. But I'd note that the 48% year-over-year does include some inorganic growth from the pickup of the three larger acquisitions, Oculus, LiveRail, and WhatsApp. We haven't lapped those at this point.
Operator
Your next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. One for Sheryl and one more Mark. Sheryl, I just wanted to ask you to talk a little bit more about big brands, give us a sense for what's working best in terms of products? And then also how penetrated do you think Facebook is now with some of the larger brands? And, Mark, what are the signals that you'll be looking for to tell you when it's the right time to ramp-up the advertising on Instagram more? Thanks.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
Our growth was really strong across all of our marketer segments, but we had a particularly good quarter in brands, I think driven by two things. The first is that we really have a great platform to do creative storytelling on mobile and I think we have that in a way that no one else does. Our mobile ad product is so integrated into the user experience and provides real creative flexibility that people have a way to reach people on mobile and that's becoming increasingly important in telling the stories that drive their business.
The second thing is video. Video is exploding on Facebook, as Mark talked about, and that gives us an opportunity to do a lot of work with marketers on video. This is the first time the technology and media vertical was one of our top four verticals. And that's largely because of the use of mobile. And so that's been really a great story for us.
In terms of penetration, we work with almost all the large marketers almost everywhere in the world. But even for the largest, the largest clients we have, we are a very small part of their budget. I don't think we have any large clients, if you look at 25% in the U.S. of consumer media time is on mobile and then 20% of mobile time goes to Facebook and Instagram that would be 5% of U.S. consumer media time.
With our largest clients, even our large ones, we're not close to 5% of their spend. And so I think we have a considerable opportunity to grow, and we also expect those underlying numbers time on mobile to continue to grow.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Your second question about Instagram and the ads opportunity there, we think about this the same way that we do ads in Facebook today. The primary goal is to increase the quality. That's our strategy for growing the business. There's more inventory that we can open up on Instagram over time because it's so early, but we're going to do that once we get to formats that are working well for businesses and that we feel really good about in the consumer experience.
And this has been a theme for our ad strategy and product development for more than a year now, maybe two years, where folks have consistently asked us what we're going to do to increase the amount of ads that we're showing. And our response has been that we're going to focus on improving the quality and relevance and that's both going to perform better for the people using our services and businesses who are buying ads. And that strategy, I think, is bearing out and we'll continue to apply it to all of the things that we do.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
One clarification, I think I said tech and media as a vertical, I meant entertainment and media that this is the first quarter that entertainment and media is one of our top verticals.
Operator
Your next question is from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you. I just had two quick ones. I was wondering, Mark, I think you mentioned you're seeing 1 billion searches per day on mobile. I was wondering if you could give us an update on your initiatives here. And also when you think about Facebook kind of as a microcosm of different applications, at some point is there a plan that we will be able to search – use the search functionality to go across all the different Facebook apps that we might have installed on our mobile devices?
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So we're pretty early in this whole thing and there's so much unique content that people share in Facebook that I think that that is the clear, unique opportunity to go for first, right? I mean there's – if you think about the overall web, there's a lot of public content that's out there that any web search engine can go index and provide. But a lot of what we can get at are recommendations on products and travel and restaurants and things that your friends have shared, they haven't shared publicly, and knowing different correlations, or interesting things about what your friends are interested in, and that's the type of stuff, those are questions that we can answer that no one else can answer, and that's probably going to be what we continue to focus on doing first. And I think what you're seeing is that as we enable more use cases and as we just get a lot of the basics right around performance and bringing the mobile features into parity and beyond what we've been able to do on desktop, the volume is growing quickly.
I think on a recent earnings call we just announced that we passed 1 billion searches total so now being more than 1 billion on mobile shows some progress that I'm pretty proud of for the search team.
Operator
Your next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one for Mark and one more Sheryl. Mark, you talked about the family of apps at Facebook. As more and more people are consuming professional content, different verticals like news, sports, and video format on Facebook, how do you think about the use case for the consumption of that content inside the main Facebook app versus maybe an even separate app for more professional content long-term for Facebook?
And then for Sheryl, appreciate the color you gave us on the evolution of targeting on Facebook. Wanted to know either qualitatively or quantitatively if you could talk a little bit about the way those ads are performing as you continue to evolve the product set around targeting on Facebook and off, in particular around Dynamic Product Ads and what that might mean for closing the loop longer term. Thanks so much, guys.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So in terms of news and different kinds of content, I know this has traditionally been something that we've delivered a really good experience for in terms of people being able to share the content that they want, being able to get access to the content that they want, different recommendations from friends, and we've a lot more coming there, so I'm excited about that. And we definitely do see in this family of app strategy that there's so many new ways that people want to share content, and so many different types of sets of people that people want to share with, right, ranging from one person at a time and that would be messaging or small group sharing or sharing with interest-based communities or sharing with all your friends at once or sharing with public.
There are just a lot of different experience that needs to get built. And a lot of what we're trying to do is enable a number of those things through Facebook, while also building unique world-class services to enable people to share all the things they care about with all the different sets of people that they care about. So we're going to keep on doing more there. But we're happy with where we are now. We have a number of services that are reaching pretty good scale and I think we'll keep on pushing that.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
To your question on targeting and closing the loop, these are two really important pieces for what we want to do. Our goal when we work with marketers is to drive their business, and that means their products off the shelves, their services into the hands of people, and so in order to do that well, we need to work on targeting and we need to work on measurement. So with targeting, a more relevant ad is just better, it's better experience for consumers because they see something they like in their News Feed and it has a higher return for marketers.
And so we're very focused on getting more people to use our targeting tools from Custom Audiences which lets people target ads differently to their current customers or people who they'd like to be their customers to look like audiences which enables us to identify the kind of characteristics of your current customers and then find other people on Facebook who share those characteristics so, again, the ad is well targeted. I think our targeting abilities are really second to none, and I'll share a recent example. XFINITY put out a voice guide for visual disabilities, and they did this, they did this by doing an Oscar commercial with a girl who is blind imagining what Wizard of Oz characters looked like.
Now by doing that at the Oscars, that's obviously TV and it's a very broad ad and that's because they were both showing a product but also working on their brand. On Facebook, they took that ad and showed it to movie fans, Wizard of Oz fans and also people connected to accessibility causes. That's actually pretty specific targeting that lets them hit exactly the right audience and amplify what they were doing on TV, and I think that's the kind of thing that only we can do at scale, and it shows how important targeting is.
When you think about closing the loop, you then have to add in the measurement piece because if we can connect, people seeing ads on Facebook to what they buy, in stores or in other ways, that's how you close the loop and that's why we put so much investment and hopefully so much innovation behind measurement. So conversion tracking is increasingly used, and we work with our marketers to use it even more, and we're also really excited about conversion list because that's the first product we've had which scientifically measures the additional business you get from Facebook ads. It compares test groups that see ads with control groups that don't. So whatever you're measuring in terms of conversions whether it's sales or website clicks or registrations, we can A, B test and see exactly what the impact Facebook has. I think we're still at the beginning of this. I think there is so much more we can do to make ads more relevant on Facebook and so much more we can do to measure results, and I think our future growth will depend on executing on that very well.

Your next question is from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Thank you very much. A question for Dave and then maybe one for Mark or Sheryl. FX adjusted ARPU growth this past quarter, it was about 35%, which is by our math about half of what it was last year and within mobile, it was about 45%, that's about a third of what it was last year. Other than tough comps, what else is driving that decline? Is it just Q1 seasonality getting more pronounced? Is there anything else – we would have thought maybe video advertising would have had actually the opposite effect. And then what's your – maybe Mark or Sheryl, what's your experience so far with Voice over IP? What is the strategy, I guess, over time? Is that something that you can start charging for or either through maybe a subscription or is there another way of monetizing it? Thanks, guys.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Youssef, it's Dave. So on the FX adjusted ARPU growth, I would just really point to the overall revenue growth rate, that's what's driving it. So you're coming up against a bigger business last year than we had in the past. So you're seeing declining rate on that basis. So I don't think there's anything specific to ARPU, it's just a reflection of what we're seeing on the revenue front as we scale, and it's sort of as expected there.
So we're really pleased with the performance that we're seeing on the revenue front, certainly on the FX adjusted basis. We're seeing strong growth in the face of really a tough currency environment. So we're really pleased with that. We think we've got the best mobile ad product out there in the market and it's just getting better. So we're really pleased with what we're doing on the revenue front.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, and in terms of voice calling, no, we're not going to charge for it just like we're not going to charge for messaging. What we're focused on doing is providing more higher quality services for free than what you could otherwise get in paying for them. And one thing that you may not know about voice calling is that by using the Internet for calling rather than the relatively low bit rate voice networks, you can actually get higher quality calls using VoIP. So one of our theories in this is that it's one of the reasons why voice calling has been a little slower to catch on is because you need the large established network of people who you know will have access to be able to receive a voice call before it, before that behavior can really take on in a big global community.
But now between Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, which are two very broad communication networks, we're pretty confident that because of the higher quality of calling that you can get through the services that we're providing that this is going to continue growing very quickly. I mean, a lot of people still – we're just very early in rolling out and promoting it. Even in Facebook Messenger, it's been out for a little while and we're already more than 10% of the global VoIP market. And I think that that's just going to continue growing and I'm really looking forward to getting the first stats on WhatsApp VoIP as well soon.

Your next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. One question for Mark, one for Sheryl. Mark, there's just this explosion in these messaging platforms worldwide you obviously bought into one. The growth has been greater than we would have expected, and perhaps you too. Do you – have you – has your thinking changed on the opportunity or maybe the need but really the opportunity to integrate WhatsApp and Facebook over the next couple of years because of the growth of WhatsApp to-date? And then Sheryl, you mentioned some verticals that are doing well. I was just wondering if I could ask about automotive and insurance, just a couple of verticals that have always been skewed very heavily towards TV advertising and the question is whether they've really skewed up more now on Facebook given the auto play video ad format. Thank you.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I mean, on the messaging question, yeah, we're pretty happy with how it's all going. I think if we're going to pay $19 billion for a company, we should have pretty high expectations for how it's going to do. So I do feel good about how we're doing, but it needs to do a lot more obviously and we're very excited about the roadmap of things that we have ahead. In terms of integrating them, no, we're not going to do that. One of the things that had been interesting, while we were watching these different services grow, was just how quickly multiple different messaging and communication services were growing at the same time, and it seemed a little bit counter-intuitive at first because it seemed like there should have been more overlap than it actually, now in retrospect looking back, seems like there is.
So you can look at countries where both services, WhatsApp and Messenger, are growing very quickly like Brazil, for example. And what you'll see is that basically people use them a little bit differently. I mean, WhatsApp is more of a clear text messaging replacement. Facebook Messenger people use to connect with people that they know on Facebook primarily. And then there are differences in the feature sets where WhatsApp is extremely utilitarian and focused on texting and now voice calling, whereas Messenger is very focused on expression and the whole set of things that fit into the tools around the Messenger platform that we rolled out at F8, communicating with businesses now, richer tools to communicate in different ways. So I think that these are just going to keep on growing is my expectation and hope, and we're excited to kind of pursue both different products to serve the different communities.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On the auto and insurance verticals, they're both still small which makes them good opportunities to grow. We're seeing good progress on both of them, and interestingly, insurance companies have been pretty active both on Facebook and Instagram, so we're optimistic about that.

Your next question is from Paul Vogel with Barclays. Your line is open.
Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Two questions. One for Mark and one for Dave. I guess, Mark, just going back to the video question again real quick. I'm wondering, given all the noise around over-the-top and long form content and given your push in video, I'm just sort of curious as to whether or not you think Facebook can or should be a player in more studio content, professionally-driven content. And then Dave, I guess for you, just in terms of CapEx, you gave guidance for this year, but again, given sort of the ramp-up in video in search, how should we think about CapEx longer term relative to, either in absolute terms, or maybe relative to revenue growth? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
I can go first. So on the CapEx growth for this year, Paul, yeah, we are ramping CapEx, obviously, to support the initiatives that we have. 2015 is a big investment year for us, both in CapEx and OpEx. It's a little bit early to be talking about how that's going to scale going forward. But, clearly, we've got a lot of areas that we're investing in, including video, including the various other services on top of Facebook. So, we're going to be investing to deliver the best quality services that we can for our users, so we'll continue to invest heavily on the datacenter and infrastructure side going forward. But 2015 is a big investment year for us across the board.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, and on video, we're excited about people sharing all different kinds of content on Facebook. Right now, a lot of what people are sharing are their social videos and content. There a lot of public figures who have pages often with millions or tens of millions of followers producing unique and really high-quality content that they're pushing out to all their fans on the network today. So, yeah, we'll continue looking at ways to grow that and it's – the product experience that we have right now is growing quite well so we feel good about it.

Your next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.
John R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. Two questions. One more on video. So with the explosive ramp in video views over the last six months, could you discuss the video advertising ramp this year? And then maybe talk about the video versus static ads within the News Feed. And then the other question would be, you reference Facebook hitting 2 million active advertisers in the first quarter, and with over 30 million company pages, how should we think about the advertiser TAM for Facebook next year and over time? Thank you.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
So, to the first question, video is a big opportunity for us. Mark talked about how we have 4 billion video views on Facebook everyday and we've always believed that the format of our ads should follow the format of what consumers are doing on Facebook. So many years ago when the homepage ticker was in vogue, we never did that. And so the fact that there's so much consumer video, that gives us the opportunity to do more marketing video as well. It's still early days and we're very focused on quality and it's worth noting that not all of the revenue from video is incremental, because the video ads take the place of other ads that we would have served into News Feed. That said, we're really excited about the opportunity I talked about, increasing the entertainment and media vertical and brand marketers, particularly. But I think all marketers have the opportunity to do video, and that's pretty exciting, including SMBs who would never be able to hire a film crew and buy a TV ad. We're seeing those put videos in. Over 1 million SMBs have posted videos and done really small ad buys around them. And that's pretty cool because I don't think there are probably 1 million advertisers who have bought TV ads in that same period of time.
When you think about our marketer growth, I think we have an ability to grow both the number of advertisers who use our platform, but also the percentage of their business that we get. So 30 million small business pages continuing to grow. We have an opportunity to turn those businesses into advertisers and marketers, and that's what we've done successfully and we're going to continue to focus on that. And we do that by building very simple ad products.
And then when you think about the percentage of spend we have, what I said before on this call, which is we only have a small percentage of even our large customers, that's true of our small customers, too. Now, there are some who spend a large portion of their budget on Facebook, but that's actually very unusual. For most people, even when they start spending with us, we're a small portion of their budget. And when you look at the consumer time we get, we are not getting the equivalent amount of time or resources from our marketers really of any size, and therein lies our opportunity to grow.

Your next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Dave, maybe you could help us breakdown the 55% ad revenue growth a little bit. Between usage, kind of are you increasing ad loads at all? Maybe you talk about the formats or is Instagram helping at all, just a little granularity on that or maybe it's just a format shift, but just help us understand what the key drivers are and how much room you still have to go on each of these things. Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Justin. So in terms of the 55% revenue growth, obviously, it's mobile News Feed is what's driving it from a fundamental point of view. In terms of what the opportunity there is to drive it, it's really about increasing the relevance and quality of the ads. That's been a key part of what we've been doing, and that will just continue to be the big driver in the near- and medium-term. And we're doing that on a number of different fronts. Part of it's about finding the right format, so it's getting the video units there for the people for whom video ads are going to make sense. It's getting the dynamic products ads in front of people for people who are going to find those ads interesting and engaging. And it's really just continuing to learn more and more about the people who are using Facebook and what types of ads they interact with and the like. And so that's part of what we're trying to do across the board.
And then at the same time, we're bringing more and more advertisers into the system and that's giving us a better selection of the ads that we can serve to the people using Facebook, and that, again, improves the quality and the relevance. So the main thing that we're seeing drive this is just improving the quality and the relevance of the ads experience for the people using Facebook, and I think that's going to continue to be the story.
I think the specific ads will be part of how we do that, but it won't be the only way. It will also be the targeting that we have and the targeting capabilities that we're doing with things like Custom Audiences and getting better and better at that. So there's a lot of different fronts that we're working on. It's hard to tease out every individual component of it. But all in all, we're really pleased with the revenue growth that we're seeing. And also, that's coupled with good engagement growth, so we're doing a nice balance of having an experience that's working well for our advertisers but it's also working really well for the people who are using Facebook.

Your next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Just two quick questions. First, on the News Feed organic reach and then, Mark, one on Apple Watch and wearables. So on the News Feed, you guys recently made tweak to kind of alter the algorithm in favor of friend-oriented content. And then on the other hand, you're also moving towards, like, hosting publisher content from New York Times and BuzzFeed and folks like that. So how are you balancing out organic reach between these algorithm changes and then whether or not professional content is hosted inside of Facebook versus coming from a third-party website?
And then the second question is, Mark, how do you view the shift to wearables with smaller screens and shorter interactions? So it looks like you guys have gotten most of the apps on the Apple Watch. Just wondering what you're doing to kind of adapt to these new smaller screens. Thanks.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. So I can speak to both of those. For the News Feed question, the North Star for us in News Feed is that we want to produce the best experience for everyone who is using the app and loading News Feed to see what is going on in the world around them, right? So when it comes to – there are lots of businesses on Facebook, there are professional content producers, our main interest here is the people in the community who are using News Feed, not those guys, right? So of course we want to build tools to enable them to share their content and all of that, but we're constantly refining the algorithms in order to make it so the experience is the best for you when you open up your phone and look at Facebook and, there are a bunch of things that are going on, we want to make sure that we're getting what you care about the most.
And we go to a lot of lengths to make sure that we're getting signals from people in our community to make sure that we're doing this correctly, in addition to the different signals that we would get from seeing people use the products. We also do a lot of qualitative surveys to see what people, what makes – what people write in that they want to see from us, what people tell us is the most important thing that they saw in Facebook today or saw anywhere in the world today and what they would've wanted to have seen on Facebook. And our goal is to just constantly refine this and make it better and we're going to keep on doing that because we think there's a lot of upside and there's a lot more that we can do.
Now, at the same time, in order to make this experience good, there also needs to be good content in the system, right, so we need to make sure that people have the tools to able to share the moments that they care about. But if you're a professional publisher, you need to have the ability to share a version of the content that you're producing that you're proud of, that can load quickly, that can be as rich as the tools enable people to see, and we're working on a lot of different tools for that.
And you can imagine that as the tools for any of this content get better, people taking photos, newspapers, writing news articles, advertisers, putting out ads for content that they want to sell, the better that content gets, the more people are excited to see it and then that informs the ranking in what the community qualitatively tells us that they want to see from us over time as well. So it's just a constant cycle on that. What was the other question?

And I know that we have a bunch of apps, and it's a space that's going to be really interesting and we're going watch closely and build what our community wants us to.

Your next question is from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC
Thank you. Two more quick questions on video. Roughly, what percentage of videos are currently monetized via ads and where do you see it headed over time? And as you look at the early video ads on the platform, how is pricing comparing to other ad formats? Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
I can take this. I mean, in terms of – in terms of what percentage of videos or ads, we're not breaking that out. I think what we said was that we're really pleased with the consumer adoption we're seeing. That's kind of the fundamental table stakes that need to be there and that's the most important thing, and we're really pleased with the 4 billion video views daily that we're getting. We know that marketers love videos so there's a great opportunity here. It's still early. It's worth pointing out that, as Sheryl mentioned, video does displace other ads in News Feed. And let me just kind of speak to how that plays into pricing as well. Video is just a format that's bid into the auction.
So video is effectively winning in the auction if it's higher priced. So if somebody's willing to pay more for a video, it's going to get served before another type of format ad. But there's not really a price differential you're paying for a video, it's just what are you willing to pay into the system. So there's not differential pricing by product, it's just what are you willing to bid for the format that you want to show to the people that you want to show it to and that's how the system works.

Your next question is from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Mark, does the OpEx guide assume an Oculus product for consumers this calendar year? And will the initial products focus on gaming or more on some of the experiences that you showed at F8 around non-gaming like that Saturday Night Live demo? And then separately, beyond searching within Facebook, should we expect to see Facebook leverage its 2 million advertiser relationships against third-party search queries? For example, when a user searches on, say, Yahoo! or maybe some Apple device, Facebook might tap it to advertisers to provide relevant sponsored results. Thanks.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Ben, let me take the OpEx guidance question. So we have not announced any specific plans for shipment volumes in 2015 related to Oculus. I just know that Oculus is very much in the development stage so it's early to be talking about large shipment volumes, and our expense guidance reflects any volumes that we might do in 2015.

Your next question is from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks. Dave, I just wanted to return to, I think, Justin's question about the drivers behind ad growth. You mentioned gains made in relevance and quality and format. Wondering if you could provide any quantitative color around ad engagement trends, clicks, shares, likes or anything like that? And then secondly, one quickly for Sheryl. In your SMB discussions, wondering if you're ever asked to help facilitate transactions in that space? Or that's an area of small business that you're interested in? Thank you.
David M. Wehner - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, Peter, just on the – on ads engagement, that's an area that we've obviously been very focused on, and we're really pleased with the results that we're seeing there in terms of driving better engagement per ad, and that's really the focus of a lot of our quality and relevance efforts. How do we find those ads that are going to be more engaging, they're going to get more clicks, that they're going to get more views, that are going to get more installs. We're working on focusing on all of those, on optimizing the relevance of the ads for all of those different potential actions that happen downstream and we're pleased with what we're doing there and the trends that we're seeing there. And, again, that's a big part of what we're trying to do to drive the overall ads growth story, as well as providing a good experience for users with the ads that they're seeing.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On SMBs, we have a very small test in the U.S. We started last quarter for buy-on Facebook, and that enables people to buy products from merchants with a buy button on Pages, and it is a product that is used and aimed at SMBs. We're also very focused on helping SMBs have a presence, especially a mobile presence. 35% of SMBs in the United States, which is probably ahead of most other countries, don't have a web presence at all, and an even smaller percentage of SMBs have a mobile web presence or any kind of mobile presence that works. And so Pages are a good and free and easy way to have a mobile presence, and that's something we're very focused on growing.

Certainly. Your final question is from Mark May with Citi. Your line is open.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks a lot. I had two. You've recently announced plans to enable longer form video content, as well as to allow those videos to be syndicated or distributed on third-party publishers. What, if any, initiatives do you have to help with this content, contributors and the publishers to generate revenue from those videos? And then secondly, on public content, what, if anything, are you doing to try to secure more unique public content, content that's potentially unique to Facebook from personalities and other sources? Thanks.
Sheryl K. Sandberg - Chief Operating Officer & Director
On the video question, we're basically focused primarily on video on our own site and service, and video tends to be pretty short form content right now on Facebook because it's playing in News Feed.
We do see some pretty cool examples of people using it well. So for example, in the election, you saw Hillary Clinton announce her candidacy very recently, obviously, and that video got 2.7 million views. Ted Cruz and others have done the same and they've gotten large numbers of video views. So we think it's a very attractive platform for people to reach people with video messages.

And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks Deborah and thanks everyone for joining today. This has been a good quarter for Facebook and a great end to the year. Our community continued to grow in size and engagement and we’re very pleased with the growth of our business. Overall 2014 was a year of great progress for the Facebook community. 1.39 billion people now use Facebook each month and 890 million people daily, an increase of active and 133 million daily active this year. Time spent per person per day across our services continue to rise growing this quarter by more 10% compared to last year and that doesn’t even include WhatsApp, which joined us late last year.
These milestone shows our community continues to get stronger. But it’s not just our community where we’ve made a lot of progress. 2014 was also a year of big investments in our future. This year we made big bets on the next generation of communication and computing platforms by acquiring WhatsApp and Oculus. We focused on serving our community better across all of our products, raising the quality and relevance of content to News Feed, improving our search and video products and improving the performance and efficiency of our mobile apps.
We continue to invest in our employees and infrastructure, grown our headcount by 45% this year and opening our newest data center in November in Altoona, Iowa. When you consider the progress of our community and our investments, 2014 was an important year for us and a good sign of how we’re thinking about the future. In the next decade, Facebook is focused on our mission to connect the entire world, welcoming billions of people to our community and connecting many more people to the Internet through Internet.org.
To serve the entire world, we need to build products that serve our community and allow people to share different types of content with different audiences. We need to offer new services and infrastructure at greater scale, but we need to create new tools and innovate to solve fundamental challenges in the places we want to connect. Doing this will take a lot of effort over the coming years and Facebook is going to have to evolve.
Similar to our transition to mobile over the last couple of years, now we want to really focus on serving everyone in the world. Our mission has always been to make the world more open and connected. This is something we’ve been preparing for over the last decade. Everything we’ve achieved in 2014 and over the last ten years has helped us to build a foundation for future of greater scale. I’m excited for our progress in 2015.
Now, with that in mind, I’m going to talk about the things that we expect to execute on over the next three, five and 10 years. Over the next three years, our main focus is to continue to serve and grow our community by delivering better services for people and businesses around the world. One sign of our continued growth and engagement is our progress on visual and public content. More than 2 billion photos are now shared daily across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. Video grew significantly this year to an average of more than 3 billion video views per day on Facebook. But we now have more than 2 billion interactions every week on Facebook between public figures and their fans.
Instagram is also growing and helping people share and consume the most engaging content in different communities across the world. Instagram reached 300 million monthly actives with more than 70% outside of the U.S. Average time spent using the app continues to be very strong compared to other mobile services. Across Facebook and Instagram, we’ve done a very good job on engagement, especially when it comes to helping people find and consume content they like.
In 2015, we’ll continue working on this as well as developing more ways for people to share even more of the moment they care about on Facebook. Five years ago, most of the content shared on Facebook was text and some photos. Today, it’s primarily photos with some text and video. Over the next five years, we want to keep developing new products and features to help people share the way they want.
When it comes to serving businesses, we continue to help drive results for businesses of every size around the world. Last week, a Deloitte's report found that in 2014 Facebook created more than $225 billion of global economic impact and $4.5 million new jobs. This is an important reminder of the big opportunity we have to create value for businesses and why we’re committed to serving them well. In 2014, we invested aggressively in improving our ad-tech and measurement tools. We’re going to continue working to provide new capabilities for marketers. Sure, I’ll talk about this more in a moment.
Next, let’s talk about our efforts over the next five years to build the next generation of Facebook services. We expect WhatsApp and Messenger to connect hundreds of millions of more people and become indispensable services for the world as well as important contributors to our business. Messenger and WhatsApp recently achieved impressive new milestone. In November, Messenger reached 500 million monthly actives, and at the beginning of January, WhatsApp reached 700 million monthly actives with more than 30 billion messages sent each day. These numbers speaks the quality of both products and the size of the opportunity ahead to help billions of people communicate and collaborate.
Search at Facebook is another important effort that we expect to create a lot of value over the next few years. In this quarter, we launched updates to Facebook search to make it easier to find content and posts on mobile and desktop. We’re going to continue listening the feedback from our community and to admit time to build really valuable products here. We’re optimistic about our ability to deliver value that only Facebook is able to provide.
Working with developers is the other part of our strategy. In this quarter, we continue to make progress with helping developers build, grow and monetize their apps. In October, we rolled out our audience network around the world. And since then, the number of apps in the network has nearly tripled and impressions served by the network have more than quadrupled. In 2015, we’ll continue to build upon our long-term goal of making Facebook a truly cross platform, platform, to allow those developers to share their work on every major mobile platform and we look forward to sharing more details at our next F8 event in San Francisco this March.
Finally, let’s talk about our plans over the next decade to connect everyone to the internet through Internet.org and to develop the next generation of computing platforms with Oculus. Internet.org now has a lot of momentum. We launched three basic internet services in Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya, and Columbia. More than a 150 million people living in these countries now have the option to connect to the internet using the Internet.org, but we’ve already connected 6 million of them to the internet, who did not accessed before. We’re very excited by Internet.org’s progress and the level of interest we’re seeing across industries, governments, and our community.
2015 is going to be an important year for our long-term plans and I expected to share more updates about our progress here over the coming months. Oculus continues to make progress towards the future of immersive VR experiences that are part of daily life for millions of people. This month the team done another good showing of ZS and developer’s interest in Oculus platform continues to grow.
So that’s my update for this quarter. It’s been a good quarter and a good end and it’s an important year for us. I want to thank you everyone in our Facebook community and our employees, our partners, and stockholders for their support. Thanks to you. Our community is growing stronger everyday and we’re making progress towards making the entire world more open and connected.
Thanks and now here is Sheryl.

Thanks Mark and hi everyone. Q4 was strong across the board, tapping a great year. This is our first quarter with over $3 billion in ad revenue and over $2 billion in mobile ad revenue. Our Q4 ad revenue grew 53% year-over-year. Our mobile ad revenue was 69% of the total ad revenue and double than the past year. Our growth is strong across all verticals in marketer segments. We also saw healthy growth around the world although growth rates outside the U.S. were effected by exchange rates.
Looking back at 2014, our team has made great progress on our three main priorities. Capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ad more relevant. We believe that the market increasingly understands that we have the leading mobile ad products and are the only platform that delivers people based marketing upscale. A shift to mobile is changing the way people consume video. As Mark said, video grew dramatically on Facebook in 2014, especially around global events like the World Cup and the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.
In just one year, the number of video posts per person on Facebook increased 75% globally and 94% in the U.S. Today, over 50% of people in the U.S. who come to Facebook daily watching at least one video per day and globally over 65% of Facebook video views occur on mobile. Marketers have followed this trend and are using video to help people discover and learn about their brands. In Q4, we expanded autoplay video ads internationally. During the holiday season, we saw many clients telling their stories creatively through video.
2014 was also the year we began scaling Instagram ads. In Q4, we rolled out Instagram ads in Australia and Canada. Marketers are excited to have access to the 300 million people views Instagram and the creativity it inspires. We’re seeing beautiful creative and great results from brand marketers across verticals from insurance and tax to retail and entertainment. For example as one of our first Instagram video advertisers, Banana Republic developed a series of videos to promote its BR clothing lines. The video showed fashion sketches from the new collection and drove a 23 point lift in ad recall. While, it’s still early and we’re being deliberate in our rollout. We believe that Instagram will become core to advertisers and mobile brand building efforts.
We also made progress growing a number of marketers using our ad products. Custom audiences, our suite of proprietary targeting product has become an essential tool for segment current and potential customers. Conversion tracking away from marketers to measure the impact of their campaigns online is also seeing wider adoption. We’ve made it easier for businesses of all sizes to plan and manage their ad campaign and for small businesses to use our targeting tools.
Travel company, Thomas Cook, recently used Facebook in Belgium to reach a broad audience and used custom audiences to send targeted messages to existing customers based on the places they’d expressed interest in. It reached 30% of the Belgium population in just one day and achieved a 3.85 times of return on investment. Results like these are attracting more marketers of all kinds to our platform. Finally, we made great progress improving ad relevance and measurements. To do this, we made significant investments in both our core measurement and targeting tools as well as ad-tech.
Earlier in 2014, we introduced ad buying capabilities based on each and frequency metrics which is similar to how brand marketers by TV ads and therefore enables better cross comparison. We improved our Ads Manager product to give better in place into ad campaign to audience an impact. In the fall, we re-launched Atlas to help marketers reach real people and measure results across multiple devices. Omnicom is our first global client and this month we announced a partnership with Havas to further expand globally. We also invested in Audience Network, which helps marketers to extend their campaign off of Facebook and LiveRail which provides publishers the video tools to monetize their inventory more efficiently.
Heading into 2015, we’re excited to build on the progress we’ve made with our core ad products as well as with newer areas like video, Instagram, and ad-tech. It is still early days in all of these efforts. There is a lot of hard work to do and we plan to invest aggressively. Our ultimate goal is to be a critical business partner to our clients, providing people-based marketing of scale to build their brands and move their off shelves.
Over the past few weeks, I have had a chance to meet with many of our largest global clients and agency partners and talked about how we can drive real business results for them, making every impression and every dollar they spend improves their bottom line. Our clients are excited by the opportunity to use video Instagram and ads on and off Facebook to reach the right people with the right message. In turn, as their ads become more relevant, we provide a better experience for the people who use Facebook.
Humming off our biggest year ever I want to say a special thank you to the Facebook teams around the world, to our global sales engineering, product design and infrastructure teams, your accomplishments over this past year are the reason our business is in such a great place. To our entire company, I feel lucky to work with you as we stay focused on our priorities and work together to help connect the world. And to our clients thank you for your partnership and your trust in us. Heading into 2015, we have big opportunities and a lot of work ahead.
Thanks and now here is Dave.
Dave Wehner
Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Q4 wrapped up a strong year for Facebook. In 2014, our revenue grew 58% to approximately $12.5 billion and we generated over $3.6 billion in free cash flow. We are very pleased with the continuing growth of our network. In December, the number of people using Facebook on an average day increased by 18%, compared to last year to 890 million.
The daily number represents 64% of the 1.39 billion people who used Facebook during the month. Mobile remains the primary driver of our growth. We ended the year with 1.19 billion people using Facebook on mobile in the month. We also continue to see solid growth with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp recently crossing 300 million, 500 million and 700 million MAU respectively.
Turning now to the financials, all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. In addition as a reminder, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles. Total revenue in Q4 was $3.9 billion, up 49% or 53% on a constant currency basis, given how significantly exchange rates have continued to move, we anticipate that this currency headwind will increase in 2015. I will give more color on this later in the call.
Ad revenue was $3.6 billion, up 53% or 58% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue in Q4 doubled to $2.5 billion or 69% of ad revenue compared to approximately $1.2 billion or 53% of ad revenue last year. Desktop ad revenue was up approximately 1% despite the fact that overall desktop usage was down. In Q4, the average price per ad increased 335%; well total ad impressions declined 65%. Similar to last quarter, these price volume trends were primarily driven by the redesign of our right-hand column ads which rolled out in the third quarter.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $257 million, up 7%. Note that the growth was driven by revenue from acquisitions made in the past year. On an organic basis, payment revenue from gains, which represents the substantial majority of our payments and other fees revenue declined 10% compared to last year. As previously noted, we expect this trend to continue as desktop usage declines.
Turning now to expenses; our Q4 total GAAP expenses were $2.7 billion, up 87%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.6 billion, up 50%. GAAP expense growth was driven primarily by significant stock-based compensation and amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition.
Non-GAAP expense growth was driven primarily by increases in headcount related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. On a full year basis, our 2014 GAAP expenses were $7.4 billion, up 47%, and our non-GAAP expenses were $5.3 billion, up 34%. We ended the year with roughly 92,000 employees, up 45%. Overall, we remain very pleased with our ability to attract and retain top tier talent.
GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion in Q4, representing a 29% operating margin, down from 44% last year; again, primarily due to expenses related to our recent large acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion in Q4, representing a 58% operating margin consistent with the margin last year.
Interest and other income and expense was a net expense of $19 million in Q4 versus a net expense of $3 million in Q4 last year. This increase in expense was primarily due to foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances during the period. In Q4, we benefited from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Our GAAP tax rate was 37% and would have been approximately 42% excluding the benefit of the tax credit.
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 31% and would have been approximately 32% excluding this benefit. Q4 net income was $701 million, or $0.25 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $1.5 billion, or $0.54 per share. In 2014, we spent $1.8 billion on CapEx and generated over $3.6 billion of free cash flow. We ended 2014 with $11.2 billion in cash and investments and a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $4.5 billion.
Turning now to the outlook, let me start with revenue. We’re still in the early stages of building out many aspects of our ads business and we remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities. Looking at 2015, there are a couple of things I want to note. The first involves how the recent movements in exchange rates might impact our 2015 revenue. Assuming exchange rates were to remain constant at today’s level.
We would expect that our total revenue in 2015 would be approximately 5% lower than it would be under 2014 exchange rates. Note this 5% represents the expected reduction in 2015 total revenue, not the reduction in the year-over-year growth rate. And second, we are reporting revenue from Atlas, LiveRail, and the Audience Network on a net, not a gross, basis. So the growth in those products will have less of an impact on our overall reported revenue growth in 2015.
Turning now to expenses. We’re tightening our ranges modestly given the better visibility into 2015 spending. We expect that our full year 2015 total GAAP expenses will increase 55% to 70% compared to 2014. We expect that our 2015 total non-GAAP expenses will increase 50% to 65%. A simple way of thinking about our investments is across three categories: people, product, and infrastructure.
On the people side, we enter 2015 with 45% more employees than we did a year ago and we will continue to invest in and grow the talent base throughout the year. In terms of product, we are investing to build great experiences for people, marketers and developers, ranging from our existing products and services to newer initiatives such as ad-tech, Internet.org, Oculus, and WhatsApp. We’ll also invest in marketing to support all of these initiatives which, as I noted, was a driver of expense growth in Q4.
Turning to infrastructure. We continue to build out our global infrastructure to enable billions of people around the world to connect, message, and share with each other. We will be investing in data centers, our network and servers to grow our existing services and support newer initiatives such as video and our global connectivity efforts through Internet.org. We anticipate our 2015 CapEx will be in the neighborhood of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion.
We expect stock-based compensation for 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses for 2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And finally, we anticipate our Q1 and full year 2015 GAAP tax rates to be in the mid to high 40s and non-GAAP rates to be in the mid to high 30s. In summary, Q4 caps off a great year for Facebook in which we executed well and also made some very important investments for our future. In 2015, we are focused on continuing to execute on the business and investing in our long-term mission and success.
With that Courtney, let’s open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now open the lines for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini
Great, thank you. I just had two quick questions. Sheryl or Mark, I was just wondering, from a brand advertising perspective, is there a way you could share with us how your conversations with these advertisers have been trending over the past 12 months, how they've been evolving, and kind of how they are thinking about the video opportunity? And then, Dave, I just wanted to follow-up on your question about total expense guidance, because in the past you've given a 5-point range, I believe, for total expenses and this year it's 15. Granted, you did tighten it, which we appreciate. And just wondering the parameters around how we think about the low end versus the high end?
Sheryl Sandberg
It’s a great time for the brand question because over the past few weeks I’ve spent a lot of time kicking off 2015 with our largest agency partners and largest clients. And I would say that people remain really excited about Facebook, but people are bigger believers because we’ve had an opportunity to do more measurement over the past year. I think there are few things about the Facebook platform that are really exciting for brand marketers. The first is the creativity and storytelling and certainly as you mentioned video is a big part of that because video is a format that marketers have used for a long time to building those connection to brands.
And the second is measurement. And what clients want and what they should want is an ability to look at their ad spend and see how effective it is, not just in the brand less metrics even though those are important but in moving products off shelves. And over the past year and half the investments we’ve made in building out that measurement have paid off. So when I sit down with clients at the beginning of this year compared to last year, we have more actual case studies of marketing we’ve done with them. We’ve been able to ad test, Facebook ads versus no Facebook ads and what the effectiveness is on their sales. And I think across the board, we’re showing very healthy, very competitive ROI. The opportunity and the challenge now is to [indiscernible] even for our largest clients globally, we still represent a really small part of what they do. And so, it’s on us to prove to them that the results we’re showing them in these smaller tests can happen in more bands and more countries with a larger part of their business.
Dave Wehner
Hi, Heather, it’s Dave. So just - yes, just following up on that where we land in the range of guidance on [indiscernible] will depend on a number of different factors. It’s going to depend on how successful we are at hitting our recruiting goals, how much we ramp in areas like marketing and how could we deploy our capital against our CapEx plan and then how we execute against our plan of ramping investments in new areas like Oculus, WhatsApp, Internet.org, et cetera. We feel good about where we are. We’re going into 2015 on a high note. So I feel like we’re making these investments from a position of strength and excited about the opportunities to put more capital to work in 2015.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I wanted to follow-up on your comment around search, its early days, but what the company is seeing in terms of the way people are interacting with the new search functionality inside Facebook broadly? And then maybe tying it back to advertising, what that might mean for closing the loop with some of your small and medium sized business advertisers and maybe even the places initiative long-term? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg 
Sure. So, our view on this is that there is a lot of unique content that people have shared in Facebook, a lot of personal content, recommendations from friends that you can get that you just wouldn’t be able to get through a traditional web search service or other app. And if we’re on this multiyear voyage to basically index all the content and make it available to people and rank it well. We started off by launching graph search which I think included more than a trillion different connections in the first system.
And the second round of the search progress that we just started rolling out at the end of last year was post search, which now has index more than I think a trillion posts, which I mean the sizes of these corpuses are bigger than anything in a traditional web search corpus that you would find. So it’s an interesting and fun challenge to make this work. We’re seeing that that people immediately understand how they can use this and find content that they seen in news feed before or that they’ve posted with just a few keywords.
And we’re excited about that, but there is a lot more to do. So that we’re not really thinking about advertising in it yet on the scale that our community operates, a billion searches per day is actually not that big compared to what we think the opportunity here should be. And we’re just continued to keep on working on it because there is just a lot of unique value that people should be able to get their friends on Facebook research.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Your line is open.
John Blackledge
Great, thanks. Just wondered if you could provide your view on Facebook as a video platform given that video views per day increased to 3 billion in December from 1 billion in September of 2014 and how we should think about the video content mix over the next couple of years, and just same kind of topic, if you can give a sense of user and advertiser feedback on the autoplay video ads. That would be great? Thank you.
Dave Wehner
I'll talk about the consumer product and then Sheryl can jump in about as. So what we are seeing and I alluded to little bit in my opening remarks is that there has been this evolution of content on Facebook over the last 10 years, towards richer format that convey more of the moment that people care about. So if you go back five years ago, a lot of Facebook was primarily capture it in a little bit of photos and also I think the primary mode that people are using to share is photos and they wouldn't be surprised up in the future that shifted more and more towards videos.
So we’re thinking about how to enable consumption first to the content of people who are sharing, and this year an increased focus on new opportunities around production so it is easier for people to capture the moment that are important to them, create higher-quality moments and pictures of content out of those and increase their experiences through that. So there is a lot more to do here and I think the business going to be one of the big trends over the next three to five years, is the growth in video and richer content in our service.
Sheryl Sandberg
From a consumer and marketers feedback on video ads point of view, there is two things really go together. It’s exciting that we’ve gotten to 3 billion video views per day, because that means consumers are using video ads and enjoying them on Facebook and in news feed. The way we think about our ads product is we want them to blend in with the consumer experience. And so the fact that we have this much consumer video on Facebook, means we have an opportunity to grow our ad business and that’s exciting for marketers.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post
Great, it looks like you did about $9 of revenue in the U.S. per MAU which implies over $30 run rate which is impressive. Sheryl may be the first question to you. How do you grow that from here is it usage, is it more higher ad loads, is it the mix of ads or is it targeting may be some thoughts on how you grow from there. And then Mark, if you look at other your three platforms WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and other things. You probably have in mind. Can I monetize anywhere as well as Facebook if you look out your five year plan? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
Yes, thanks for the question. When you think about what’s happening, certainly the growth has been good, but it’s still true that marketing dollars have not followed consumer time and the same percentages. So in the U.S., mobile gets 25% of consumer media time, but only 10% of the ad budgets. And to take one comparable example, that means that for every consumer hours spent on print, marketers spend $1 and they spend $0.07 per hour on mobile, which means that we have an opportunity to grow. One of the most important ways we grow is not just bringing more marketers into Facebook, having them use more of our ad products, but as you mentioned better targeting.
A more relevant ad is a better ad experience for consumer - for consumers, but also drives them much higher returns from marketers and since we’re running an action, as our ads get more relevant and we provide higher ROI. We should be able to continue to grow. I think we’ve done a good job over the last year, making our ads more relevant. I think most people on this call would say that you seek more relevant ads than you used to a year ago, but I still think, you know, some of the Facebook ads still have rooms for improvement in terms of relevance. And so, we see a lot of room for improvements there, both in the ROI we deliver and in the experience we can provide to consumers.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yes, so I will add something to that just on the side of how we think about value through Facebook and I will talk about the other apps. In terms of the product developments that we do here, we have four major groups inside of the company. This is kind of how our company is organized. We have one which is focused on growing the community, one which is focused on kind of increasing content consumption and people’s engagement, another which is focused on kind of efficiency and helping people to get the most value out of each moment that they’re spending in Facebook. And then the fourth group is our core business, which is focused on helping people to see the best ads and basically make the most money per moment that people are spending at the lowest cost in most efficiency in terms of serving people.
And there is, I think, big upside in each of those four categories. I mean our community is growing. I mentioned in our comments upfront that time spent across our services is growing by - grew by 10% year-over-year per person, which is pretty meaningful. Utility and efficiency are increasing and of course the ad business per person and the efficiency of our services are both increasing as well.
So I am pretty excited about that and think we’re organized in a way where we can continue visiting of that. The other opportunities, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, I am really excited about and I do think that they’re going to reach the level where they contribute to our business in a pretty big way, but it’s really important to get this right and not rushing. And you know what I would say around messaging, as we’re pretty early in that cycle, we are about where Facebook was in around 2006 or 2007 where at that point Facebook was really just a consumer product.
There were no businesses in the ecosystem. And a lot of people were telling, okay, don’t put better ads in. And that’s not wrong. I didn’t think that that was going to be the right way to build the products or build the business. So instead what we did was built pages, which was a way for businesses to interact for free in the system and start creating organic interactions between people and business. And so we could figure out what - the people are using Facebook 1 and from businesses within Facebook and we built more tools for pages and businesses to engages.
And our recent success with advertising is really just built on some of those organic interactions between people and businesses. And what you see in Messenger and WhatsApp now is we’re still in the early end of that curve where the interaction is still primarily people to people and businesses are starting to figure out in the case of WhatsApp much less than Messenger so far. What the organic interaction is, but we’re going to have to go through a whole cycle of figuring out how that works before it really make sense to start monetizing them in a big way. But yes, I mean, I am a big fundamental believer and that these are going to be very big contributors to our businesses over time, but we just have to do it right. 
Operator
Your next question comes from line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ben Swinburne
Thank you, two questions. Sheryl, can you talk about where we are in the North American market versus your other regions in terms of sort of advertiser maturation and acceptance of the Facebook platform? The growth rates in North America to be really impressive despite of being your biggest business when you look at the ARPU trends and as compared to the other regions that was tend to be - seem to be moderating a bit. And then I was wondering, Dave, if you could talk about the pricing growth which actually accelerated from Q3 to Q4, can you give us some color there. I know there were changes to LiveRail, but anything else you would add about why there was a huge acceleration in pricing growth? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
North America remains a really important market for us. And as you said, we’ve had growth. We’re very happy with. It’s still true that for any kind, no matter how big they are for us, we represent a really tiny part of their ad spends and we represent an underinvestment in terms of where they can reach their consumers. So we believe by continuing to make these investments, we can really continue to grow. We get 20% of people’s time on mobile phone in the U.S. between Facebook and Instagram. We don’t get close to that in terms of anyone’s marketing spend or the time they may spent. We say to our clients over and over again is that we want to drive their business.
And that’s what probably the most important thing we’re doing for these large North American spenders is around the measurement work we’ve done. Two years ago, we were not able to measure all the way through to purchase off the shelves and now we can. Yesterday, we rolled out a product we call lift, which is really the next consideration of our measurement capabilities. That enables larger customers to go and set up ads with control test groups, and so they can AB test. This group of people saw Facebook ad, this group of people didn’t and they can measure all the ways through to conversion of whatever they’re measuring whether it’s an online conversion to a sale.
We think the measurement out there online and digitally is not particularly accurate. People don’t have real people based measurement through our investments in Atlas and through our investments in - the core Facebook measuring tools. We think if we can show the ROI marketers are getting and we can increasingly do so, we can continue to penetrate the North American market.
Dave Wehner
Ben, its Dave. So also just building on what Sheryl said worth noting that the drop in the value of international currencies impacted our results outside the U.S. to some of what you’re seeing here is a result of that. It reduced year-over-year revenue growth rate by 7% to 8% in the different international regions. So that’s a big reason why you see the U.S. doing much better as well as the fact that’s just more advanced market in what we’ve done in terms of just building up the advertiser base and getting into option of our best targeting products as Sheryl was talking about.
Going to your question on pricing growth, I just reiterate what I said in my comments, it’s largely due to the right hand column redesign and then also the shift to mobile where we don’t show right hand column ads. So that’s really what’s causing the pricing shifts. Then fundamentally, we just continue to get better targeting and that drives better engagement. And as we get better engagement that drives better ROI for our advertisers, which ultimately, I think as Sheryl commented on earlier, gets reflected in better pricing of our ads. And that’s a big opportunity for us and we are seeing that we’re getting better and better of driving engagement from the ad units that we have and getting the right ad in front of the right person. So that’s a big factor as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Douglas Anmuth, your line is now open. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.
Brian Wieser
Hi, thanks for taking the question. First, I was wondering if you could talk about the degree which you think premium video content is - or is not necessary to opt when we capture budgets from advertisers that might otherwise have gone to TV, you have a couple of initiatives around ABC and NFL. So I was curious to get your thoughts on that? And separately, I am not quite sure you’re using Atlas and specially those - or new to Atlas. Do you have a sense that your spending on digital media is changing or if so how - alternately are they just happy with campaign management tools? Thanks very much.
Sheryl Sandberg
So on video ads what really matters is that consumers are using video on Facebook, because that gives us an opportunity, one, to provide a great consumer experience, but two, to have ads in ad-tech consumer experience. If the other consumer video on Facebook, video ads and new feed will be very joined, as a percentages of the video you’re seeing, video ads gets nicely into that experience. I think it matters as much what the video content is and so well we are certainly exploring some premium content as he said, we have an Annabelle Verizon test out there in the public ad. We’re already seeing pretty exclusive growth without that kind of premium content in the system in large numbers and so we’ll continue to figure out. We’re certainly open to increasing video content either way. But we haven’t quite figured out what the mix needs to be and right now the growth is very strong.
In terms of Atlas, we just relaunched this fall and we’re just seeing as deals get done in broad adoption. So I think its too soon for us to report that Atlas drives an increase in digital spend or an increase in any particular kind of spend but you should be believe really deeply, which is that Atlas is going to revitalize marketing by making the measurement more accurate. If you look at how digital ads are being measured. They are being measured based on a cookie based world that assumes that people have one device, largely a PC. And that is not real, consumers have phone, they have tablet, they have PC's as well and the ability to understand that one person to serve an ad and measure all the way through correctly. We think it’s going to massively improve the efficiency in the system as we get the battle.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Peter Stabler
Thanks for taking the question. One for Sheryl. Sheryl, as you push further toward monetizing off platform inventory. I’m wondering if you could speak to state of your relationships with premium publishers. There is a narrative out there, we sometimes encounter that, that publishers are growing a bit concerned about the power you guys wheel, particularly as you push into monetizing off the platform. Thanks very much.
Sheryl Sandberg
Our audience network efforts are still pretty new. We have a goal of serving more relevant ads to people off Facebook which will provide greater reach for Facebook marketers and also a better opportunity to monetize for publishers. We are seeing some nice results as Shazam reported that using audience network increase the revenue from ad networks by 37%. We believe that working with publishers, if we can increase the value of their inventory by providing more relevant and targeted ads. They are going to be really happy with that opportunity and we are in the early stages of finding those partners.

Thanks a lot. First for either Mark or Sheryl on the subject of public video content and what you guys are doing to increase the amount of a video in the News Feed are there things in terms of actors, celebrities, public figures that you can do to economically incentivize those creators of, let they, the higher-quality user generated content onto the Facebook platform be at a revenue share what have you, were relative to the economic for those types of folks on competing online video platforms. And then just one quick one for Dave, you mentioned - as you mentioned you will be shifting the accounting for Facebook audience network and live rail to be for revenue to be net of pack in 2015 versus growth in 2014. I’m just wondering why [indiscernible] to do that and is there any you can help us with in terms of order of magnitude of that shift. Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
So, on premium video content, we haven’t figured out exactly how important this is to the ecosystem or how much we are going to invest or what kind of monetization we are going to offer. Video is a growing quite nicely through the ecosystem right now. we have made a lot of investments in public content working with public figures to use the Facebook platform, we’re by far the largest social platform and increasingly you are seeing public figures, everything from news broadcaster to journalist at a public figures do a lot on Facebook and that’s important to us.
Because it provides the kind of sharing people want, people come to Facebook to share with their friends and family but they also come to Facebook to connect with everyone from politicians to journalist to celebrities they want to connect with and get news and we definitely seeing public content grow as a percentage of what people get. We also had some nice wins with the Golden Globe this year other things we are doing to get people doing some partnership we did [indiscernible] with CNBC to show how we can help content creators increased their distribution and reach people directly on Facebook.
Dave Wehner
Yes, Anthony, it’s Dave. So, just to be clear that net revenue recognition for those products that’s how we did it in Q4 as well those are all small today, but there is not a change in accounting in 2015 that’s how we accounted for those products in Q4, as far as the net versus gross we just evaluated all the facts in circumstances and made the judgments that net revenue recognition with the most appropriate treatment here.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler
Thanks. Just following upon the video concept how important is it that Facebook post the videos versus I guess sharing clips from third-party players in the feed and what percent of that $3 billion streams daily is Facebook embedded versus from other players and are you able to monetize videos from third party players today there is a way to walk around that in the future. Thanks.
Dave Wehner
This thought that we shared of 3 billion a day is all made on Facebook. So there are probably other shares from other video services as well. But the way that there was looking our services or as if there is links to other sites, and the reason why I think made a video is so valuable for people using our service is that when someone uploads a video to Facebook directly we can optimize how it delivers right. So we can make it autoplay. We can find the right quality and bit rate to send down to the person based on their connection overtime. And optimize all kinds of different things. So what I think people are finding from public figures to everyday videos that people are uploading is that the best experience that you can get is by uploading content native to Facebook, which is, I think the big part of the growth that we seeing there.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Colin Sebastian
Great, thank you. I wonder if it’s possible to distinguish how much of the growth in advertising revenues can be attributed to changes in organic compressions. And how you balance the desire of business partners to contribute content to feeds versus monetization. Thank you.
Dave Wehner
That’s right. Exactly understand the question. But let me see if I can take a crack at it, Colin. I mean, we are seeing obviously great growth in DAU, which is up 18%. We are seeing growth in times spent across the network up 10% per DAU. So you got those sort of underlying drivers of engagements driving growth. We are also monetizing at higher rates because we are able to get better targeting into the ads and get better conversion for advertisers. So that’s reflected in better pricing. So there is a number of different factors that are coming into play. But clearly driving organic growth in engagement, it’s critical in the business and we are seeing good success there.
Mark Zuckerberg
One thing that I’d just add to emphasize here because its I think there have been a couple of questions so this is the fact our primary strategy for growing the ad business is increasing the quality of the content, not increasing the number of ads to our story that people are seeing on Facebook. So there are impacts like as people consume more content on Facebook, within the ratio of ads that organic content that will showed might be more ads.
But overall, our strategy is much less to that increasing the volume of ads and much more about increasing the quality of the content and the quality of the targeting to get the right content to the right people. And this is a pretty controversial strategy internally and we will ensure that is going to work out. But for the last year it’s really fueled our growth in a good way and we feel very confident that this is the right path going forward as well.

Your next question comes from the line Carlos Karjner with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Carlos Karjner
Hi, I have two quick questions. First when you say that time spent decreased 10% year-on-year it is roughly uniform across your geographic regions. And secondly, Mark I think we have Mark’s in every earnings call you talk to investors for a considerable amount of time about Facebook first to connect the world, and specifically about the Internet.org which suggest you think this is important for the investors. Can you clarify why you think this most of the investors and importantly why you think Facebook can make a significant difference of scale even that you’re unauthorized per user in emerging market is about five bucks to connect and the user who has no device accomplish maybe at least in terms of dollars. Thank you.
Dave Wehner
Well, it matters to the kind of investors that we want to have. Because we’re really mission focused company and we wake up every day and make decision because we want to help connect the world and that’s what we’re doing here. So part of that the subtext of your question is that yes, if we were only focused on making money we might put all of our energy on just increasing ads to people in the U.S. and the other most developed countries. But that’s not the only thing that we care about here.
So I do think that over the long-term that focusing on the helping connect everyone will be a good business opportunity for us as well. And we may not be able to tell you exactly how many years that’s going to happen and but I think these countries get more connected the economics growth the ad markets growth and Facebook and the other services in our community or the number one and number two, three, four, five services that people are using then over time we will be compensated for some of the value that we have provided but this is why we are here, we are here because our mission is to connect the world and I just thinks its really important than investors know that.
Mark Zuckerberg
And Carlos on that time spent per DAU that we are just giving the one point, we are not breaking any thing out by region.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with Barclays. Your line is open.
Paul Vogel
Great thank you very much. I am just curious given the impact that currency had on the quarter on growth rates outside the U.S. is there any market should be fall out particularly either better or worst that might be massed by the currency swings number one. And number two I’m just sort of curious if currency does stay where it is, does it all impact sort of your spending plans or how and where and when you’ll invest? Thanks.
Dave Wehner
Hi, Paul, it’s Dave. It - sort of taking your second part first we’re not really making investments decisions on short-term fluctuations in currency. So I would say in general no, it’s not effecting those decisions. There are certainly big macro effects that are going on and part of those are what’s driving a lot of the currency fluctuation as well. So you have regions that are certainly growing more quickly and growing more slowly. So from a macro perspective, the United States is doing better in terms of growth versus Europe versus Latin America. You see those compounded in both currency and sort of macroeconomic conditions in those regions.
So I think generally we’ve got more favorable market conditions in which to operate in the U.S. Overall, I would say the business is driven by the fundamentals of us, continuing to execute against our plan. So whether you’re in a market that’s suffering a little bit from a macro economic headwinds, we’re still - we still have the best mobile product in the market, in that market and we’re growing. So, I think at the end of the day, it’s the fundamentals of our business that are going to drive our success and we’re kind of focused on that. The one of these at least give some color around how the currencies might impact the 2015 results.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Robert Peck with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Robert Peck
Yes, I have two quick questions. One Mark, you’ve spoken much here today about the e-commerce opportunity in front of Facebook and particularly the buy button. Could you elaborate a little bit on plans around e-commerce than what you see that opportunity? And then Dave, I was wondering for investors, could you maybe go through your view and how you look at capital efficiency and ROI so that whether it would be acquisitions or CapEx or even OpEx. How you look and see you’re getting a good return on that spend. Thanks so much.
Sheryl Sandberg
Q4 is a really important quarter in general, but its particularly important quarter for e-commerce, so it’s a timely question. When you think about buy on Facebook, it’s a [indiscernible] U.S. we started last quarter and enables people to buy on pages. To be clear, you’re not buying from Facebook, you’re buying directly from the merchants and it’s really an SMB product to give them capability they haven’t had. We’ll see what happens in terms of where people convert whether it’s on Facebook, but we think the opportunity to connect consumers with the product that they then purchased is a really big one where we play in that most directly, it’s a time and attention consumers have as well as the information to do very relevant advertising and we’re going to stay focused there.
Robert Peck
Robert, I think the bulk of the investment that we’re doing is really focused on the capital in the OpEx to deliver against the core mission of enabling billions of people to connect and share. So for the most part, we’re looking at what should we need to deploy to deliver against the mission to deliver against our overall financial results. There’re places where we can individually takeout specific projects whether it would be M&A or specific capital investments and then we’ll look at those on an IRR basis for specific projects, but you have to recognize that we’re basically one large business and we’re operating against capital deployment against delivering against the objectives of that business. So that’s the bulk of the spend that we do, but certainly we look at things on an ROI basis on individual project basis as well.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Arvind Bhatia
Thanks for taking the question. Just quickly on WhatsApp, I know this focus will be user growth for a while, but in the future as you do turn on the monetization engine, just curious what are some of the primary ways that you’re assuming growth will come from advertising - or games perhaps and also on WhatsApp user growth would you be able to callout where that’s coming from? Is there any particular areas that are stronger and curious how that’s doing in the U.S.? Thank you.
Dave Wehner
So you’re right that the focus for WhatsApp is on helping to connect a lot more people, all right. So when John and team joined us, one of the first things that we agreed on and why I think it made sense for them to join is that now they can focus for a few years on getting to one billion more than that and continuing to scale beyond that. SMS is an incredibly global and universal product and I think WhatsApp just has a huge opportunity to third billions of people. In terms of what the business looks like, I mean at the end of the day, it’s a distribution business like Facebook and Instagram, how you most effectively convert that into business opportunities for customers whether that’s through payments or ads or other different kinds of structures.
We’ll figure that out what the optimal thing will be, but the first order of thing to do is to helps our billions of people here, help to continue to increase engagement, I mean people are spending a lot of time in WhatsApp, sending more than 30 billion messages a day, which is really crazy when you think about the volume there compared to the global SMS volume overall. And I think if we do that there will be a number of opportunities. I mean people ask me this question awhile ago about - when we talked about games on Facebook as well.
And I always talked about our canvas business on desktop even though its payment is actually the same thing as our business on mobile around app install and engagement. What developers test for is distribution and whether they’re doing that through payments or ads or whatever it is, it kind of is all the same. The most important thing is to help people connect, help people and businesses connect and create business opportunities and then you get a small amount of the value that you’re creating on top. So that will play out over the next set of years and it’s one of the intellectual challenges that I am really looking forward to tackle.
Sheryl Sandberg
Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Your last question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney
Great, thank you. Sheryl, the size of the ad revenue that the Facebook is generating in the growth, there is - these are large budgets that are shifting over to Facebook. Any commentary on where you think those budgets are coming from? What are the sources of funds? And then I know, Dave, the engagement levels seem to be rising, there seem to be a little slip in engagement levels and the DAU over MAU ratio in Asia and rest of the world at least sequentially. Is that just noise or is that a reason to panic? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
I don’t think there is any single source of where the dollars are coming from certainly as consumer time and attention is shifting to mobile, the marketer time and attention. We pay a lot of attention to the marketer segments we work with that we’re seeing strong growth from brand from direct response like e-commerce from SMBs and developers. And we stay pretty focused not really on the source of where the money is coming from, but what are the objective people are spending against on Facebook, so that we can meet all the different objectives. We understand that in order to continue to grow, we want to continue to grow. We’re going to have serve multiple objectives on the Facebook platform and that’s what we’re focused on.
Dave Wehner
Mark, I think the simple story as we’re really pleased with how we’re executing on the engagement front, 64% of people is coming to Facebook monthly coming on an average day as we think a great stat. I think small changes are pretty much noise. I mean we’re really happy with it. We talked about things like the video engagement. Mark shared some stuffs like photo - how much photo sharing is going on across our properties. So overall I think engagement is a great story for us and we’re really happy with it.

And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining today. This has been a good quarter for Facebook and we’ve achieved strong results across the board. We've continued to grow our community in both size and engagement with 1.35 billion people now using each month and 64% using Facebook daily. On mobile 1.12 billion people now use Facebook each month and 703 million people each day, nearly 40% growth from this time last year.
Looking to our business, we continue to do well. This quarter total revenue reached $3.2 billion and advertising revenue grew 64% year-over-year. Mobile now accounts for 66% of our advertising revenue. These results show that Facebook is getting stronger every day, as a community, a partner for developers and marketers and as a business.
One thing that I'm particularly pleased about is that while we’re investing aggressively and making progress towards our big long-term goals, we also continue to execute well against our near-term priorities. On previous calls, you’ve heard me talk about our big company goals of connecting everyone, understanding the world and building the next generation of platforms. These goals are important for us and part of our foundation of our strategy for the next decade, but achieving these will involve many different efforts and steps along the way, some that will be achieved rapidly and others that are going to take longer.
So with that in mind, I’d like to run through our progress this quarter on the different efforts that we expect to deliver a lot of impact over the next three, five and 10 years. Let's begin with our three-year goals. Over the next three years, our main goals are around continuing to grow and serve our existing communities and businesses and help them reach their full potential. When you look at the size and engagement of our community, our progress remains very strong. 864 million use Facebook every day and across our core products, we continue to see huge engagement. For example around 700 million people now use Facebook Groups every month. Achieving this scale shows that we're delivering experiences for the way that people want to share and connect.
Another example is our progress on public content. Last quarter I talked about how we're working to connect people around important public moments and personalities on Facebook. This quarter we've continued to build on our results and there are now more than 1 billion interactions every week between public figures and their fans on Facebook. 
The investments we have made in video have also played a big part here. This quarter we announced a new milestone for video on Facebook achieving 1 billion video views, a day of made of videos. During the summers the ice bucket challenge drew more than 10 billion video views by 440 million people which is a good sign of how far our video product has come. 
Instagram has also made a lot of progress this quarter. In August, the Instagram team launched Hyperlapse, a standalone app for time lapse of videos on iOS. The team has also invested heavily in improving the speed and performance of Instagram on Android. This has helped drive Instagram's strong international growth which in some countries has achieved more than 100% year-over-year growth. Globally, people using Instagram now spend around 21 minutes a day on average using the app. This is a strong figure compared to the industry and a good sign that Instagram's strategy is on the right path. Our other big focus over the next three years is to continue to serving businesses well and creating a lot of value for marketers.
As our results show, our approach here is working. To continue delivering value for businesses, we work to improve the quality of ads and news feed by reducing low quality content and improving our targeting to show more timely and relevant content. We’ve also made some big advances in our ad tech, most importantly the launch of our new Atlas platform. Atlas offers marketers a lot of new capabilities to help reach people across devices, platforms and publishers as well as improving measurement in online campaign. We're very excited for the future of Atlas and Cheryl is going to talk more about this in a moment.
Next, let's talk about our strategy over the next five years. Over the next five years, our goals are around taking our next generation of services, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Search and helping them connect billions of people and become important businesses in their own right.
One big priority for us here is messaging. And continuing to build and grow Messenger and now WhatsApp as well as great services. This quarter we made an important change to our mobile messaging efforts by transitioning people to Messenger on iOS, Android and Windows Phone. We believe that this change allows us to offer a better and faster messaging experience on mobile, and our data shows that people who use Messenger, usually respond to messages about 20% faster.
This month we also completed our acquisition of WhatsApp. I'm excited to be working with this team and John to join our Board. WhatsApp continues to be on a path to connect more than 1 billion people around the world and we're going to be working into accelerate their efforts here. Another key part of our strategy is helping developers to build more great social experiences on our platform.
Over the next few years, our goal is to make Facebook a cross-platform platform that allows developers to build, grow and monetize their apps across every major mobile platform. We’ve continued to make good progress here. This quarter, we opened our audience networks to all developers and publishers, allowing over 1.5 million advertisers on Facebook to extend their campaigns across mobile and for developers to begin monetizing their apps.
We're also excited by the continued adoption of App Links, our deep-linking technology for mobile apps. App Links is now used by hundreds of apps across iOS, Android and Windows phone and in just the past six months, the developers have created links to more than 3 billion individual destinations in these apps.
Now let's talk about how we're approaching our goals over the next 10 years. For the next 10 years our focus is on driving the fundamental changes in the world that we need to achieve our mission, connecting the whole world, understanding a world with big leaps in AIs and developing the next generation of platforms, especially in computing.
This is a very big period, a very busy period for our efforts with Internet.org. In July we worked with Airtel to launch the Internet.org app in Zambia. This provides free data access to a set of basic internet services for health, education, employment and communication. The results from this are very encouraging. We've already heard a lot amazing stories about how people are using the internet to add value to their lives. We hope to bring the Internet.org app to many more countries soon.
Over the last few months, I've also travelled to several countries and met with policy makers, key distributors and people and communities that are coming online for the first time. Increasingly industry and governments are seeing expanding internet access as one of their core priorities. This is positive development for our work with Internet.org in our long-term goal of connecting everyone in the world.
Finally, let's talk for a minute about our progress of Oculus. As I've said before, with Oculus, we're making a long-term bet on the future of computing. Every 10 to 15 years, a new major computing platform arrives and we think that virtual and augmented reality are important parts of this upcoming next platform. This quarter, Oculus continued to make progress towards this vision.
In September, the first Oculus developer conference took place, where we announced a new prototype VR headset on the path of a consumer version of the Rift. We continue to see a lot of excitement in the developer community and we've now shipped more than 100,000 of Rift developer kit to over a 130 countries. It's still early for Oculus but we are encouraged to see the variety of apps and games being developed for this platform. 
Internet.org and Oculus are just two of the huge opportunities ahead. Our efforts here will take longer to achieve their full impact, but we're going to continue preparing for the future by investing aggressively. So that’s how we’re approaching our strategy over the next three, five and 10 years, while focusing on our big goals of connecting everyone, understanding the world and building the next generation of platforms.
This has been a quarter with strong results. I want to thank the entire Facebook community, our employees, our partners and our stockholders for their continued support. Because of your contribution, Facebook continues to grow in strength and to create greater value in the world for people, partners and businesses. We have a long journey ahead, we’re on the right path and I'm excited about the progress that we’re making.
Thank you and now here’s Sheryl.
Sheryl Sandberg
Thanks Mark and hi everyone. We had another strong quarter and we’re continuing to execute well on our priorities; capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of Facebook marketers and building products to make our ads more relevant. Our growth this quarter was again very broad-based. We saw strong performance around the world as well as across verticals on our four marketer segments, brands, direct marketers, developers and small and medium businesses.
I’d like to briefly highlight some of our progress on the product front and then focus on important new investments we're making in ad-tech. One of our main ad protocols is to make ads more relevant. Just like content and news feed, when ads are more relevant, they provide a better experience for people using Facebook and a better return for marketers.
One of the best ways to improve relevance is to help advertisers reach the right audience with their messages. Facebook age and gender targeting is 45% more accurate than the digital industry average. Working with Facebook advertisers can also target based on peoples interests. In addition, we’re continuing to build out custom audiences, which enable marketers to use their own data to segment current and prospective customers. We’re pleased with the response from clients and we’re focused on driving deeper penetration with those existing and new clients.
We also offer lookalike audiences, which help marketers find potential new customers who are similar to their current customers. To share one recent example, earlier this year global financial services company MetLife wanted to find new customers for life insurance policies. Working with this agency Markel, they used lookalike audiences to find people more like their existing customers, MetLife ran ads that let people to their get a quote website page. Over the six-month campaign, the leads that came from Facebook resulted in new policies at a 2.4 times higher rate than MetLife’s next best performing channel and at half the cost of display ads.
We’re also making steady progress with newer ad initiatives. Throughout this quarter we continue to enable auto play for more video ads. We’re also continuing to roll our ads on Instagram. We think there is good opportunity with both video and Instagram ads but we're going to remain deliberate and slow in our approach to scaling those businesses.
We’re also making longer-term investments that we believe will be important for Facebook and the ad industry. In Q3, we re-launched Atlas, closed our acquisition of LiveRail and rolled out our audience network. So I want to spend a few minutes discussing our longer-term ad-tech strategy. We’re investing in ad-tech for a simple reason. Consumers are shifting quickly to mobile and the advertising industry is not keeping up.
2013 was the first year the average American adults spent more time on digital media than watching TV and that gap has continued to grow. Today the average adult in the U.S. spends nearly 25% of their media time on mobile, but advertisers spend only about 11% of their budgets there. One of the main reasons the budgets aren’t moving as quickly as consumers is that advertisers hasn’t yet had an effective way to serve ads and measure their returns on mobile. Current solutions work well for person with one device, especially, a PC and for sales that happen online.
But today people often have multiple devices and still make many purchases in physical stores. Nilsson OCR [ph] data shows that the digital industry is less than 60% accurate in demographic targeting of ads, which means that four in 10 people are seeing the wrong ads.
Similarly marketers are not confident that they can measure mobile ad performance. Many of the most commonly used measurement systems over emphasize the value of the last click. This does not make sense, given that studies of Facebook campaigns show that over 90% of ad driven in-store sales come from people who saw an ad but didn’t click on it.
It's clear that marketers and publishers need better tools for the mobile world. This is an industry problem that we believe we are well placed to solve. Our re-launch of Atlas last month during Adweek was an important early step that builds on the advancements and measurements we have made over the past two years. The new Atlas is an ad serving and measurement platform, we completely rebuilt. By using Facebook data, Atlas can deliver highly relevant ads, regardless of device.
Atlas is also able to provide accurate measurement by connecting online marketing to in store sales. Importantly, Atlas does all of this in a privacy protected way. Neither Atlas nor Facebook tells marketers who you are. At Adweek, we had productive conversations about Atlas with many marketers and agencies. We are pleased with their interest.
We’re also investing in additional pieces of our ad-tech platform. Our audience network improves the relevance of ads inside mobile apps. LiveRail provides tools for publishers to enable personalized marketing at scale via their apps and websites. We believe LiveRail can build on their success in desktop video with the concrete solution for mobile publishers.
I want to emphasize that the investments we’re making in ad-tech are long-term. These are large and strategic investments. The path will take time, but we think that provide a necessary foundation for the advertising industry to make the shift to mobile and for Facebook’s long-term growth. We recognize that by staffing engineers in these strategic ad-tech areas, we forego shorter term product improvement improvements which would generate revenue more quickly. We believe these are the right decisions.
As we look toward 2015, we're going to stay focused on the areas I've talked about today; capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of Facebook marketers and building products that make ads more relevant. Our investments in ad-tech will be an increasingly important part of all of these efforts. 
Thanks everyone and now here is Dave.
Dave Wehner

Thanks, Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Q3 was a solid quarter across the board. We had strong revenue growth, generated $766 million in free cash flow and continued to make investments to position us for long-term growth. 864 million people use Facebook on an average day in September, up a 136 million from last year. This represents 64% of the 1.35 billion people that used Facebook during the month of September.
Mobile continues to be the core driver of our growth. Over 1.1 billion people used Facebook on mobile during the month of September, up 250 million from last year. In addition, we have hundreds of millions of people on mobile using Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. 
Turning now to the financials. Total revenue in Q3 was $3.2 billion, up 59% compared to last year or 58% on a constant currency basis. Total ad revenue was nearly $3 billion, up 64% compared to last year or 63% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue growth was strong around the world with each of our four reported geographic regions growing by 50% or more compared to last year. 
Mobile ad revenue was approximately $1.9 billion or 66% ad revenue, compared to approximately $881 million or 49% of ad revenue last year. Desktop ad revenue was up 11% compared to last year, but was flat sequentially. In Q3, the average price per ad increased 274% compared to last year, while total ad impressions declined 56%. The increase in the average effective price per ad was driven primarily by the redesign of our right hand column ads which resulted in larger, more engaging ads that delivered more value to marketers and thus had higher reflective prices. These right hand column ads were also fewer in number, which drove the decrease of impressions in the quarter. To a lesser degree, the shift of usage to mobile, where we don't have right hand column ads also continued to contribute to the reported price volume trends. The price volume trends were largely consistent across our four geographic regions.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $246 million, up 13% versus last year, however payments volume from gains which represents the substantial majority of our payments and other fees revenue declined 2% compared to last year, notably for the first time and we expect this trend to continue as desktop usage continues to decline. 
Turning now to expenses. Note that beginning in Q3 our definition of non-GAAP also excludes the amortization of intangible assets and historical non-GAAP measures discussed today have been updated accordingly. You can find our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on page 10 of the Q3 press release.
Our Q3 total GAAP expenses were $1.8 billion, up 41% from last year and non-GAAP expenses were $1.4 billion, up 39% from last year. Cost of revenue grew 11% on a GAAP basis and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. We incurred expenses in the third quarter of 2013 related to the transition out of certain lease data centers. This mitigated our cost of revenue growth rate in Q3 2014, as it has done in the last two quarters. Operating expenses excluding cost of revenue were up 61% on a GAAP basis and 72% on a non-GAAP basis versus last year, primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs. 
We ended Q3 with 8,348 employees, up 44% from last year. Of the nearly 1,200 people we added sequentially about a quarter were from acquisition. Organic growth was high as the third quarter is our seasonally strongest new hire start period. Overall we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain talented people who enable us to make strong progress against our mission.
Q3 operating income was $1.4 billion, representing a 44% operating margin, up from 37% last year and our non-GAAP operating income was $1.8 billion, representing 57% operating margin, up from 51% last year. Interest and other income and expense was a net expense of $61 million in the quarter, versus a net expense of $10 million last year. This increase in expense was primarily due to foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances and largely resulted from the substantial reduction in the value of the euro relative to the dollar experienced form the beginning to the end of the quarter. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the quarter were 40% and 35% respectively. 
GAAP net income was $806 million or $0.30 per share and our non-GAAP net income was $1.1 billion or $0.43 per share. In Q3, we spent $482 million on CapEx and generated $766 million of free cash flow. We ended Q3 with approximately $14.3 billion in cash and investments. This does not reflect the approximately $4.6 billion cash payment that we made in conjunction with the WhatsApp acquisition, which closed earlier this month. 
Turning now to outlook. I'd like to start by noting that my forward-looking statements include the impact of both Oculus and WhatsApp. In addition, as part of the WhatsApp deal, we agreed to file a registration statement to register for resale approximately 178 million shares issued to the WhatsApp stockholders. Nearly all of those shares will be fully registered and tradable during open trading windows in Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 under the registration statement we plan to file later this week.
In light of our recent acquisitions and our plans to file this registration statement, we are providing some additional guidance this quarter, including a more specific outlook on the current quarter revenue and a preliminary view on 2015 expenses. This is a more detailed outlook than we have historically provided or plan to provide on future earnings calls.
Let me start with 2014 expenses, we expect our full year 2014 total GAAP expenses, including cost of revenues, stock compensation and the amortization of intangibles will grow approximately 45% to 50% versus the full year 2013. This increase from our prior range of 30% to 35% is primarily due to the impact of this WhatsApp acquisition on stock-based compensation charges in the fourth quarter.
We continue to expect that our full year 2014 total non-GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock compensation and amortization of intangibles will likely grow in the neighborhood of 30% to 35% versus the full year 2013.
Turning now to revenue, we expect that total revenue in the fourth quarter will grow in the range of 40% to 47% versus the same quarter of last year. Please keep in mind that Q4 of 2013 was our first holiday season with the rollout of new seed ads at scale, which makes for a difficult comparison.
For taxes, we anticipate the GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter will be approximately 45% to 50%, which is higher than the current rate due to large non-deductible stock-based compensation charges related to the closing of the WhatsApp transaction. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate should be similar to our Q3 rate.
For share count, we expected our fourth quarter fully diluted share count will be approximately 2.8 billion shares, taking into account the shares that we issued upon the closing of the WhatsApp deal. We expect that our 2014 CapEx will be at the low end of our prior $2 billion to $2.5 billion CapEx guidance.
And lastly, while it is relatively early, I wanted to provide some preliminary color on our expense outlook for 2015. As Mark discussed in his remarks, we believe that we have very substantial growth opportunities in front of us and we plan to invest aggressively to capitalize on those opportunities. As such, we plan on 2015 being a significant investment year.
Our current expectation is that total cost and expenses on a GAAP basis, inclusive of stock-based compensation charges related to the recent transactions are likely to increase 55% to 75% compared to the full year 2014. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect total cost to increase approximately 50% to 70% compared to 2014. Tax rates for 2015 should be similar to our fourth quarter rates on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
In summary, we’re very pleased with the growth of our network, the great momentum we continue to see in our ads business and the significant investments we're making to drive near-term and long-term growth. We have large opportunities ahead of us and we’re focused on capitalizing on those to achieve our mission and track long-term shareholder value.
With that operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
 
We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan

Dave, just to follow up on the comments that you just made on the outlook or expenses for ’15, can you just help us understand more on the non-GAAP expenses, the 50% to 70% and where we should be thinking about the incremental dollars being spent there primarily? And then secondly, can you just talk Sheryl, perhaps about what you’re seeing in terms of branded advertising, whether you’re seeing more of it in fraction there as more bigger brand CPG companies, auto OEMs are coming onboard and how you're positioned there for the holidays? Thanks.
Dave Wehner
Sure Doug, I’ll take the first part. So we’re investing where we think there is a great opportunity for long-term growth and that’s going to be really investing and continuing to grow the talent base of the Company. So, we’re investing in the people and that’s a big part of it. And we’re also investing on the product side to grow the existing products, but also to invest in new areas like Oculus, WhatsApp and then the ad-tech initiatives that Sheryl was talking about.
From an infrastructure side, we plan to invest to support the growth of the core business. That includes things like video. It also includes things like our global growth efforts with Internet.org. So we’re really kind of investing across the board on that. And I guess in summary, we've got -- the strength of the business today is really putting us in a strong position to invest smartly for the future and we’re doing that.
Sheryl Sandberg
On brand, we’re seeing very strong growth among our brand marketer segment. We’re really excited about the engagement we’re having right now with brand marketers and agencies. We think we’re the first technology platform to offer the ability to do creativity and storytelling app scale in a personal way and we talk a lot with our clients and partners about personal marketing at scale. You'll find that our clients -- that they are different parts the adoption curve. We have clients who are very early on and they don’t want any products or think about their ongoing messages without including Facebook and there are some for whom we're not yet core and we are working on that.
With all of this, we know we need to go client by client and we're especially focused on measurement because measurement is so key for this segment. A lot of the products that brand marketers are selling are bought in store and so showing that online and mobile ads lead to in store purchases is a hugely important part of our strategy going forward as I talked about, and video is really exciting as well.
When you think about the holiday season, Q4 is a really important time for our client and that makes it a really important time for us. And I think people are increasingly recognizing that mobile is important. 65% of people use their phones while they are out shopping and people are recognizing that opportunity.
From an earnings perspective, last Q4 was a great quarter, both because our business was growing but also because that was when we rolled out ads fully into news feeds and so it’s worth keeping that in mind when you think about how you think about our business going forward.

The next question comes from Ben Sachachter with Mcquarie. Your line is open. 
Ben Sachachter - Mcquarie

A few questions. David, there was no mention of a '15 revenue range but I was wondering if you could give us any thoughts on how much margin should compress in '15 versus '14? Then a couple for Mark. Mark, now that you've spent more time with the Oculus team, can you update us on how your plans for Oculus have evolved since you first tried the device on. And then you mentioned it when you talked about your 10 year outlook. Does that mean we shouldn't expect any consumer Oculus product in the next one or two years? And then similarly on Search, you mentioned your five plan. So does that mean we shouldn’t expect anything on Search for the next five years?
Dave Wehner

Hey, Ben, it's Dave. We're not really giving any guidance on 2015 revenue. We gave the growth range that we're expecting on Q4, which was 40% to 47% and that's down from 59% in Q3. But we're not providing any specific guidance on 2015. Revenue sort of outlined the expense growth that we expect because of the substantial investments that we're making, also driven by some of the acquisitions that we've made. So hope that, that is helpful for everybody.
Mark Zuckerberg 

Sure. And on your questions around Oculus and Search and some of the other things that we're doing; the strategy for Oculus is to help accelerate their growth. They have two products around Rift on PC and they are supporting Gear VR and the Samsung team and building the mobile version. And I'm really excited about both of them.
I don't think that this is going to be -- it needs to rich a very large sale, 50 million to 100 million units before it will really be a very meaningful thing as a computing platform. So I do think it's going to take a bunch of years to get there. Maybe -- I don’t know, it's hard to predict exactly but I don't think it's going to get to 50 million or 100 million units in the next few years. So that will take a few cycles of the device to get there and that's kind of what I'm talking about.
And then when you get to that scale, that's when it starts to be interesting as a business in terms of developing out the ecosystem. So when I'm talking about that as a 10 year thing, its building the first set of devices and building the audience and the ecosystem around that until it eventually becomes a business.
Some of the things like Search and some of these other products, this may sound a little ridiculous to say, but for us, products don't really get that interesting to turn into businesses until they have about a 1 billion people using them. And so for Facebook, we're there with News Feed and that's why in the near term our priority is really around continuing to grow and serve that community and making sure that the business around News Feed and those mobile ads fully reach their potential. 
Over a five year time frame, we have a number of services, which we think are well on their way to reaching a 1 billion people. Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram and Search are a number of them. And once we get to that scale, then we think that they will start to become meaningful businesses in their own right. And I think that the right way to think about that, as I've tried to say repeatedly on these calls is, not that we're going to try to monetize them very aggressively in the next year or two, because I really think for each of those categories, the right strategy is to first focus on connecting 1 billion plus people and reaching the full potential before very aggressively turning them into businesses.
But I do think that this is such a big opportunity ahead of us. I can't think of that many other companies or products that have multiple lines of products that are on track to reach and connect 1 billion that have a clear path of how we can turn them into a business. So that will be a very fun and exciting challenge to work on over the next five years.

Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs

I just had two. I guess, one for Sheryl, if you could talk about the comments you made about giving advertisers a better feel for attribution, I was just wondering what percent of attribution do you find today is given to the last click and how overstated do you think that is right now? And then just a follow up question for Dave. Given your total expense range of 50 to 70, wider than what we've seen in the past. I'm just wondering how should we think about the low end versus the high end. Under what scenarios are you thinking about those ranges?
Sheryl Sandberg

Heather to your first question. We think measurement really, really needs to evolve for the world we're in today in many ways. One of those is over emphasizing the last click and the percentages by which that's done really varies but we think substantially across the industry are over emphasized. But there are also other problems. The current measurement systems don't work on mobile, because they are largely cookie based. They are not accurate and we think they are only 59% accurate in even the most basic demographic targeting, they just go offline to online. They really work well for one person with one device, usually a PC, thus making online purchases. The world we live in today, I bet you, everyone on his phone call has multiple devices and people look at ads online and then purchase offline, as well as deserve more relevant ads and better targeting. So, as we re-launch Atlas, as we think about investing in ad-tech, we’re looking to solve all of these problems and we think our re-launch is the first step in doing that.
Dave Wehner
Heather, yes, and on the range of guidance, it is wider, it is obviously an early view into 2015. And so consequently it is a wide range. It's giving you the best view that we have on it at this time and we’ll be updating that in the future in terms of the expense guidance range that we have in the past on an annual basis each quarter. So the big drivers will be things like the pace of hiring, the success we have in building, the great teams that we want to build at Facebook, but we’ll be updating that on an ongoing basis,

Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric Sheridan - UBS

Mark you made comments about public content and the way that’s evolved on Facebook. I'd love to get deeper thoughts there about the way you think content distributions sort of develops on pace over the longer term? And then one for Sheryl. With the ad-tech acquisitions and moves you’ve made over the last year or to two, wanted to know when you think we should be looking at ad-tech being fully deployed in the marketplace, and what sort of returns that might generate for Facebook? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg
Sure, well I can start off by talking about public content. So historically a lot of people use Facebook for sharing moments in their lives with their friends and smaller sets of people, right? So we have Messenger for one-to-one communication, Group that just reached 700 million monthly active this quarter and then News Feed, which is kind of the primary thing that people are using to share with all their friends at once.
And one of the big things that we -- looking at the FICO system, thought that there was a big opportunity in was public content, where its content that people are either comfortable sharing with everyone or want to consume that is public and shared with everyone. So we’re looking at a few different areas. Video is a very big priority. News is a very big priority, because a lot of people want to share that on Facebook already. And enabling public figures, whether they are celebrities, they are athletes, they are actors, or politicians or leaders in different kind of communities to get on Facebook and use the platform to distribute the content that they want. So those are the three areas that where -- that you'll probably see us investing the most in over the next year or so. And we’re making a lot of progress and I shared some of the stats before, but we’re very proud of what we’re doing and we’ll have more to report soon.
Sheryl Sandberg
On ad-tech, I think we’re in the middle of what is a very fundamental shift from marketing that is cookie based on a PC, one desktop to people based marketing on multiple devices, to marketing that is primarily for online sales, to marketing that affects those online and offline sales on mobile. So I think we're right now in a pretty big shift and we’re not close to fully deployed there. We have a lot of pieces to do. Our Atlas re-launch is new. We’re first growing our client base and we're pleased with our progress there and we're putting these other pieces in place on audience network and LiveRail. So I think we're pretty far from being fully deployed on even this big shift. But I think in our industry nothing ever fully deployed, that as soon as we catch up here, there is going to be another movement and something else that happens that we have to react to and build the technology for. And so we remain -- we're a long term company run by a founder with a long run vision and we want to keep our eyes ahead on these changes and technology and keep deploying against them.

Your next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
I just have two questions, one for Mark and then a quick one for Dave. Mark, I don’t think I heard you mention payments in the three, five, 10 year plan. There has been some speculation of payment offerings within Messenger. Can you give us a sense at a high level of what you've envisioned Facebook potentially doing in the payment space longer-term across merchant payments, consumers' products like savings and lending or peer-to-peer? And then how do you see social interactions tied in with payments evolving? Does messenger make payments better than what’s out there in the market?
And then Dave, just a clarification. So the high end of the 4Q revenue guidance assumes a pretty sharp drop-off, even normalizing for some extra currency hit. So are you seeing anything out there that makes you concerned about pacing into the quarter or is it largely business as usual or it's just a tougher law of large numbers type situation?
Mark Zuckerberg
I’ll start on payment. So payments is an important part of the online business ecosystem, but we’ve traditionally thought about this as something that we’re going to partner with other companies on to enable great solutions, rather than trying to compete and do it as a business ourselves. And the reason why we’ve taken this approach is it's very important for all online businesses and our customers and partners that there is a good online payment system. People run ads to get customers and sell products and at the end of that conversion, if there is a good payment system that is smooth, then people will buy more things, which ultimately makes the ads and all of whole online flow more valuable for those partners and therefore more revenue and profit for our business as well.
We view the ads part of the business as a more efficient part of the businesses than payments itself. Payments tends to be fixed fee whereas and ad, because of the option model, there is really good price discrimination built in. So a partner or business who is willing to pay us 30% of their revenue can bid that and some of these willing to only pay 5% of the revenue can bid that and the auction model inherently takes care of that.
So we think that focusing on the ads part is going end up being the more effective thing for us to do but we realize that it’s important for the ad system over time for and for all of our partners for there to be a payment system, which is why we're excited about partnering with credit card companies and partnering with PayPal and all of the different folks doing online payments to make their solutions as good as possible as well.
Dave Wehner

Hey Ross, it's Dave. Our view now is that Q4 revenue will come in that 40% to 47% year-over-year growth range. As I mentioned, Q4 of '13 was just an absolutely fantastic quarter for us. We had News Feed sort of rolled out at scale. It was our first $1 billion dollar mobile quarter. So we're comping against just really outstanding quarter last year. That's really the largest issue. You asked about currency. We did see the euro drop about 7% in value over the course of Q3 and that really didn't pick up as you saw. It didn't pick up in an impact in Q3 at all because it happened at the end of the quarter. So that will be a headwind that we see and that's factored into the guidance.

Your next question comes from the Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets

Great, Sheryl. You talked about being careful about -- and slow about the rolling of the video ads -- auto play video ads and Instagram monetization. Have you seen any pushback in terms of user experiences to date on videos or on video ads, is that overall caution? Is there anything you've seen in the data that suggests that you want to keep it at a really slow pace? Thank you.

Sheryl Sandberg

We're pleased with the consumer response we've had on both fronts and we remain really optimistic over the long run about Instagram and Video, because there's a lot of interest. I spoke before about creative story telling images. Video can be such a big part of that and it create a really resonant experience for brands and companies. We really believe in going slow, that as we grow products, we pay attention to the consumer experience. We want the consumer experience always to come first. So although we're very optimistic about the opportunity here, we continue to grow slowly and pay lot of attention to the quality of the advertising we see.
To share one example, we are seeing people using both Facebook and Instagram and also Video and other ad products in combination. Mercedes Benz launched the GLA, which was their first compact SUV on Facebook and Instagram and they found that by doing Facebook and Instagram together, they got a 54% increase on their website visit. So a lot of our products as you do one, you also do more Facebook ads as well and that's something we're paying a lot of attention to.

Then next question comes from Paul Vogel with Barclays. Your line is open.
Paul Vogel - Barclays 

I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit on the engagement side. Your DAUs to MAUs continue to be very strong. Can you just sort of maybe talk a little about your older cohorts versus your newer cohorts and how they're behaving and then also geographically? And then sort of on top of that, on the frequency side, obviously DAU doesn’t measure how often people come back more than once per day. So is there any update on increasing the frequency of visits? Thanks.
Dave Wehner
I don’t think anything to update on the later front Paul, but the DAU to MAU ratio, which we focus on engagement was strong across all the geographic regions. So North America remains at the high end and we're really pleased with what we're seeing there.
Nothing to update on cohorts. Obviously we are really pleased overall, what the mobile impact has on the DAU to MAU ratio and really encouraged what we're seeing across the Board on engagement. So I don’t think anything other than that specifically to call out.

The next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Your line is open.
Mark May - Citi

Thanks. For the last couple of years, -- back on the OpEx for next year guidance, for the last couple of years you've grown your cash OpEx by around a $1 billion a year with some consistency and I think that seems to be continuing in the second half of the year. But obviously your midpoint guidance -- OpEx guidance for next year represents a very significant - I think it's like 2.5% -- $2.5 billion increase at the midpoint. You obviously plan to change the level of investment in something quite significantly. So I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more specifically what are a couple of the projects that are capital intensive projects that you're planning for next year and is it physically possible to accelerate your hiring by that much next year?
Dave Wehner

Yes, thanks Mark. The projects really that Mark and Sheryl both outlined in terms of continuing to invest in the core Facebook experiences, growth engagement and monetization, they are building up the ad-tech side and the investments that we want to make, as well as the recent -- continuing to invest against the recent acquisitions that we made in terms of WhatsApp and Oculus. So it’s really the investments we're making there.
We're also going to be supporting global growth with our Internet.org initiative, investing there. So it's a number of the key initiatives that Mark outlined in his comments that we’re investing against and again we’re giving a range on what we think is a reasonable range of guidance on that. You saw headcount. We had a good growth to headcount this quarter and we’re going to be continuing to invest as we think that these will be good investments over the long run in terms of being able to drop our long-term growth.

The next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co.

Just a couple of questions on video. How should we think about Facebook as a video platform and how does the mix of video between user generated versus public content versus professionally produced content evolve over time? And for example, is the upcoming short-film content produced by Lionsgate around the Twilight franchise that will be shown exclusively on Facebook. Would that increasingly be the type of content Facebook users will see in the future? And then if you could just give an update on the Instagram monthly active user comp, that would be great? Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg
I can speak to the video point. I think it's going to be all of the above in terms of what you said. Most of the content on Facebook is things that people are sharing with their friends and the people around them. So I think we’ll continue to see that in video as well. There's definitely the mis-trend over the last few years where, if you go back five years most of the content was text. Now a lot of it is photos and if you look in the future, as networks get letter and the ability to capture good video and share in a good way improves then -- I think that going forward a lot of the content that people share will be video. It's just a very compelling.
There is also a lot of great public content that’s video, especially the shorter form content that they are mentioning I think will fit very well into the feed form factor that people consume on Facebook. So I think we’re going to see a lot of both of these things and it's going to be an evolution over the next few years. But I think you can expect to see a ramp up of all this.
Dave Wehner
And on Instagram, we haven’t updated the number. They continue to grow nicely, but we haven’t announced a new public number on Instagram.

The next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch 

Mark it seems like you taking a portfolio approach to apps and you've got a several different experiences for people on mobile devices and other devices. Can you give us your philosophy around that? And as people use things like WhatsApp and Instagram, is it actually, maybe partially hurting Facebook’s reported metrics and how do you think about putting this altogether and helping every app kind of work?
Mark Zuckerberg
Sure. So one of the things that’s happening on mobile is that there's an increased focus for apps to do one thing really well. Like so on desktop a lot of the things that might have fit well into a single Facebook website now are -- in order to best serve people, you need to build multiple standalone different apps. So we’re seeing that with Facebook and Messenger and the work that we did to kind of split out Messenger from the Facebook app to give a dedicated experience or an app that we think is a better experience. And we’re going to do more of that in the future, as well at the Facebook Creative Labs product that we’re releasing.
Part of what we’ve seen is that the use cases for products like Instagram and WhatsApp are actually more different and nuanced from then the products that people compare them to, that Facebook had already built. So for example on the WhatsApp and Messenger side, Messenger is primarily used today for people to chat with their Facebook friends, within this context of maybe it's not like a real-time text. Like you would send an SMS on your phone, but it's something that you are sending to one of your Facebook friends and if they happen to be there, then you can text back and forth or maybe they respond later.
SMS and WhatsApp are more for kind of real-time activity. People have contacts on WhatsApp who they wouldn’t want to make friends on Facebook. Their graphs are somewhat different. So one of the things that we found interestingly to us as well was that, Messenger and WhatsApp are actually growing quickly in the lot of the same countries. There's countries that they're growing in that are different and there are countries that they are growing in that are the same, which to me suggests that they actually are in more different markets than you probably intuitively would have thought and that was definitely our understanding as we dug more into this.
Same with Instagram, and the type of sharing that happens on Instagram versus News Feed. We’ve recently started doing more to help promote and accelerate the growth of Instagram from the Facebook app itself because what we found is that by doing that, we’re net overall increasing the amount of sharing the people can do and connecting what they can do within our whole family of apps. So we're definitely seeing that this is all accretive and positive and we think that in the future there will probably be room for more apps for sharing as well.

The next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities

First for Sheryl, I want to just come back to the theme of media measurement you gave us in good perspective. Can you help me with first party data versus third party data? Can you get where you need to go with brand marketers using your in-house tools like Atlas or do you think you need the validity and integrity of a third party measurement source i.e. Nicholson in order to get there.
And then second question for Mark. Mark I was just wondering, where do you see Facebook at this point in terms of its place in the hardware ecosystem? And given so much time is spend in your apps, do you think it’s possible that you could get more aggressive in devices, in hardware in order to achieve some of your longer-term or 10 year goals that you've laid out?
Sheryl Sandberg

To your first question, data is really important for both the measurement and targeting. And when you think about first party and third party data, you have to think about both of those usage. Certainly with measurement, third party verification of that data can be very important. A lot of our largest clients and agencies also build their own data systems, which are a very important part of measuring and kind of certifying everything we do with them. So we're using a combination of first party and third party.
I think where this really gets interesting is around relevance. And as I spoke about, that's a major theme for us because we think one of the best things we can do to drive more value for marketers and improve the consumer experience on Facebook is improve relevance, and data is a great way of doing that.
So for example with custom audiences, custom audiences is a combination of our clients using the data they have on their client base, combined with the data we have that we can target. Let's say target one ad to existing customers to get them to engage more and buy more; and one add to brand new customers. And you could see how you're different ads for people who have never bought your product and a different ad for people who are currently buying your product would make a lot of sense. And then you look at something like look alike audiences, where we're looking to map customers who share characteristics, age, demos, likes, interests with current customers. And all of this takes a combination of first party and third party data, all of which we do in a very privacy protected way.

Before we go to that, I'll just quickly answer the hardware question that we didn’t get a chance to answer on the last question. We actually probably do more with hardware already than is apparent because we design and work with folks to build up all of our data centers and the servers there. So I do think that if that ever became the right thing for us to focus on from a product perspective, we have some of the skills there already.
And when we are thinking about working Oculus, that's actually one of the areas where we think we can help out because we've up a supply chain team and we've been I think pretty effective at delivering what we've needed to run Facebook as this large system of scale. So -- but that said, I think that there is a huge amount of value in delivering these network and software services and that's where you should expect to focus, on the things that we talked about. 
Sheryl Sandberg

To the question about the roll out of products. I think the usual way we do things is that we roll out products slowly and then we iterate. So one example is custom audiences. We roll out custom audiences. Then we add on that website custom audiences to target ads to people visiting websites or then mobile app custom audiences, ads to people who have visited mobile apps. And one is building on the next, building on the next.
Similarly, this month -- earlier this month we have launched local awareness targeting. It's a new option that allows local businesses to reach nearby customers. And what you saw that -- it wasn't a massive launch. It was a small launch where we enabled this targeting, get people to use it and we'll develop it. Then there are the exceptions such as Atlas. Atlas was one big launch that we're still in the process of doing and that's really because of the product that we've bought and needed to rebuild. But for the most part, our product development tends to be very iterative and that's what you can expect from us going forward.

The next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor. Your line is open.
Youssef Squali - Cantor

First question for Mark. Mark you recently came back from China. How do you think about that opportunity and what gives you the confidence that you can actually be successful where so many have failed. And then the second on Instagram; we've seen some very complementary data that shows that Instagram is actually becoming more popular than ever with some brand marketers. Just wondering what are the best performing ads formats on the platform right now and where is the ad load versus where Facebook is.
Mark Zuckerberg

Sure. So on China, we're already doing more in China on the business side than I think a lot of folks think about. A lot of Chinese businesses use Facebook to grow their export businesses and to help find customers around the rest of the world and grow the Chinese economy there. So that's actually a pretty meaningful thing for us already and we always are looking to find ways to help businesses around the world to grow. And that will be just a long term thing. I mean our approach to China and all these -- and every country is very kind of long term. We're going to be here for decades and we want to create good relationships with these countries and businesses around the world that will help and grow over the long-term.
On the Instagram side, I think we're pretty early. There have been a number of good ads, both video and images that I think have been pretty effective, but it's fairly early and in the growth phase at this point, the top priority for Instagram is to grow from 200 to more and eventually connect billion or more people and I think that that's something that should be possible and that’s what I'm really focused on and excited about now, while we also start building out some of the parts of the business as well.
Deborah Crawford
Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator
 
Your last question will come from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Your line is open.
Scott Devitt - Stifel

I think this question is for Sheryl. The app download business seems to have grown quickly and become a big contributor of the ad revenue total for Facebook and just wondering how you think about app reengagement relative to app downloads and which of those you think is a larger, long-term opportunity for the Company. Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
I'm glad you asked the question because I think there has been some confusion around our mobile apps and our mobile app ads and our mobile app engagement ads. So engagement ads, it's still pretty early and we have rolled those out and rolled those out after mobile app ads. So we definitely seen lots of them. But we do think there is an opportunity. I think the broader point is that our growth in mobile ads is very broad based. It's across all market or segments and it's across all of our different ad formats and we talk about our mobile ad business growing. Mobile app ads are a small part of that, that's growing in line with our total business.
The other thing that I think people get a little confused about is who is using mobile app ads. I think commonly when you think about mobile app ads, people often think about developers and developers are moving them and we're pleased we're able to help them grow. But they're also being used by some of the largest branders and marketers in the world.
So for example Burger King. Burger King just used our mobile app ads to do app installs for their app. And the app was to find Burger King, look at their menu and nutritional options, use mobile coupons and use virtual gift cards. So that was one use of our mobile app ads, which is not what people typically think of.
Deborah Crawford

Good afternoon. My name is Jay and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you very much.
Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.
Deborah Crawford
Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook’s second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Sheryl Sandberg, COO and Dave Wehner, CFO. Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today’s press release and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
During this call we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our Web site at investor.fb.com.
And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining today. This was a good quarter for us and a good end to the first half of the year. We’ve continued to grow our community in size and engagement with 1.32 billion people now connecting on Facebook each month, and 63% of them visiting daily. Our momentum remains especially strong on mobile to now 829 million people using Facebook everyday with more than 650 million people using our services on mobile every day.
One thing that’s exciting is that there is still so much room to grow. On average, people on the Facebook in the U.S. spend around 40 minutes each day using our service, including about one in five minutes on mobile. This is more than any other app by are, but overall people in the U.S. spend about nine hours per day engaging with digital media on TVs, phones and computers. So there is a big opportunity to improve the way that people connect and share across -- how we all engage with the rest of media as well.
Now when it comes to our business, we continue to be pleased with our growth. This quarter, our total revenue grew to over 2.9 billion and advertising revenue grew by 67% from a year ago. Mobile now accounts for 62% of our advertising revenue, which is a good sign of how the growth of our community mobile is also producing better business results for our partners. The results this quarter show our continued focus on improving our core products and business. We’re going to continue investing aggressively in areas that are important for our mission and long term strategy, but we’re also going to stay focused on our core products and business. This is the best way for us to continue creating value for our community.
Now let’s talk about how we’re making progress and our three big company goals; connecting everyone; understanding the world; and building the knowledge economy. Our strategy for connecting everyone has two basic approaches. Our first approach is Internet.org; our effort to bring affordable Internet access to every person in the world. Our second approach is by giving everyone more tools for connecting, so they can share all the different kinds of content they want with the right people. Instagram, Messenger and creative laptops are a part of the second approach.
So with Internet.org this quarter we’ve continued to deepen our partnerships with global operators and laid a foundation for running tests in more countries. Already, our initial partnerships in the Philippine, Paraguay and Tanzania have helped around 3 million people connect to the Internet who had no access before. We’re really proud of these early results. In June we acquired Pryte, which has a lot of expertise bringing affordable Internet access to communities by partnering with mobile operators, app developers and content providers. Later this year, we expect to launch a broader set of free basic Internet services in a number of other countries as well.
In our app efforts, we’re continuing to build momentum with messaging. People now send than 12 billion messages a day on Facebook, and in April we reached 200 million monthly actives on messenger. Last month we announced that David Marcus will be joining us from PayPal to lead our messaging efforts. We expect David to continue growing Messenger, building out new experiences to serve our community and ultimately to build Messenger into an important business.
Instagram continues to make great progress in giving people new ways to share their stories through photos and videos. Last month we made one of the biggest updates ever to Instagram by adding new creative tools that allow people to refine exactly how their photos look and feel. This is an important part of building out Instagram’s capability as a platform and serving the creativity of the Instagram community.
Next, let’s talk about understanding the world. As of last month, on average, more than 1 billion search queries are made every day on Facebook. This is a great milestone and it shows we're in a unique position to answer a lot of questions for people. But this is just a start. And over the next few years as we make progress on building out search and our broader efforts in artificial intelligence, I expect us to deliver even greater utility for people.
Our progress on public content is also very promising. As part of helping people to better understand the world, we want to help you connect around important public moments and personalities. And now nearly 800 million people on Facebook are connected to public figures. These connections are driving conversations at a huge scale. During the World Cup over 350 million people made over 3 billion interactions on Facebook. To enable even more of these conversations, we've improved the ranking of videos and newsfeed and launched new APIs to help TV and media organizations use Facebook content in their productions. Public content will continue to be a growing focus for us over the coming months and we plan to invest in building more great products and partnerships in this area.
Now building great social experiences to serve our community isn’t something we do alone. Supporting developers is a key part of our strategy, and in our F8 conference in April we announced new ways to help mobile developers build, grow and monetize their apps. Over 1 billion people use Facebook on their phones every month and more than 80% of the top apps on iOS and Android now use Facebook logins. So we think we’re in a great position to be the cross platform-platform that lets developers build great apps across every platform.
So far we’re very encouraged by the reaction from developers. App Links, our new method of deep linking to specific content in any app is now being used by 100s of apps across iOS, Android and Windows phone, with links to more than 1 billion individual destinations in these apps. We also launched our Audience Network, our first big effort to help developers monetize on mobile and we’ve received a lot of interest from developers. We’re rolling out the Audience Network gradually. We’re going to continue to ramp this app over the coming months and are excited by the opportunities ahead.
Finally, let’s talk about our efforts to build the knowledge economy. This has been a strong period for us, and we’ve reached some new milestones in the business. Now more than 30 million small businesses use Facebook pages to connect with their customers and more than 1.5 million of them are active marketers on Facebook. To continue delivering the best returns for marketers, we’ve been very focused on improving the quality of the ad experiences for our community. Our goal here is to make ads as interesting and useful as your friend’s content on Facebook. We’re investing heavily in this area. In this quarter we launched a number of efforts to improve the quality and relevance of our ads, including our new ads preferences tool, interest based advertising and improvements to News Feed design to reduce low quality content.
In some countries our surveys indicate that our ads are getting close to the quality level of organic content. But in most developed countries we still have lot to do. We expect to continue to focusing on this for a long time.
So that’s my update on how we’ve been executing over the last quarter. It’s been a quarter with good performance and continued momentum. So I want to thank everyone who works with Facebook and is part of our community, including our shareholders and partners. Because of your efforts, we’re continuing to make progress towards our mission to help connect the world, and we’re improving 100s of millions of peoples’ lives every day. I am grateful for your support and to have the chance to work with all of you.
Thanks and now here's Sheryl.
Sheryl Sandberg
Thanks Mark and hi everyone. As Mark said, we had a strong second quarter. Ad revenue grew 67% year-over-year to more than 2.6 billion. Mobile ad revenue grew 151% year-over-year and that makes up 62% of our ad revenue. We continue to focus on three key areas in investment; capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using Facebook; and building our ad products. These investments continue to generate broad based growth.
All geographies and all marketer segments performed well this quarter. Our team has a really strong belief in what we’re building; the world’s first ad platform that delivers personalized marketing at scale. While we believe it’s still early days, we’re pleased with the progress we’re making and I want to join Mark in congratulating our global teams on their continued execution.
Today I'm going to focus on two of our key marketer segments; small business and brand marketers, as well as cover some of the investments we’re making on the products in ad-tech front. We believe that personalized marketing of scale can drivers else for all types of marketers. Just a few weeks ago, I was in India and I hosted our first India SMB roundtable. One of the entrepreneurs I met, Vivek Prabhakar built his house just a few years ago to raise the money to start his and his wife’s dream business Chumbak, a company that makes India Inspired products. Facebook is Chumbak’s leading marketing channel and is responsible for 35% of online revenue and 38% of their Web site traffic. Their Facebook ads deliver a 5x return on advertising spend and has helped company grow to more than 150 employees in three offices.
We have more than 30 million active small business pages, and over 19 million of these are active on mobile. We think we have a big opportunity to help SMBs like Chumbak grow their businesses, and I'm pleased to announce today that we have over 1.5 million active advertisers. We’re also ramping up our engagement with this community. In the U.S., we’re hosting Facebook Fit workshops in cities like New York, Chicago and Miami to help small businesses. And we’re doing this globally, including forming our first European SMB cap.
We’re also making great strides in our work with our larger brands to increasingly recognize how our scale, targeting and measurement capabilities can drive great results. For example, P&G and Gillette worked with us and agencies IVS and Mediacom to launch its Vector III razor to men in India. 80% of the 100 million Facebook users in India are on mobile and a majority of these are using feature phones. This was our first feature phone only Facebook campaign. It reached 60% of Gillette's target audience and generated significant lift in both message and ad recall.
As we work with brand marketers around the world, we focus on how they can leverage our technology platform to build their brands to create a story telling. We saw many great examples of this, at the recent online festival. We were excited that campaigns that make Facebook a key part of their effort took home prestigious awards.
The World Cup also provided a great opportunity for brand building on Facebook. Facebook was an important part of this global event with 350 million people joining a conversation, generating 3 billion interactions. The final was the single most talked about sporting event in Facebook history, generating 280 million interactions from 88 million people.
Brands such as Diesel, Nike, Ford and McDonalds capitalize on this global conversation. McDonalds worked with agencies, OMD, Framestore, and ARC sponsorship, as well as Facebook's Creative Shop to produce 30 videos that used french fries as players. FryFutbol recreated the most spectacular World Cup moments and ran them as videos the very next day with the french fries acting as the players. This campaign reached 125 million people in 158 countries.
We also remain committed to investing in product development to drive higher returns for all of our marketers. Our custom audience's capabilities, which enable better targeting are been adopted quickly and are now been used by 91 Ad Age 100. Earlier this year, we launched website Custom Audiences, which enabled marketers to target recent visitors to their websites. This is likely targeting but it’s even more effective because it works across both web and mobile. We're pleased with the early reaction from marketers.
We also introduced premium autoplay video ads this year. Video on Facebook helps brands extend their TV investments by combining traditional reach focus campaigns with our unparalleled targeting abilities. Today, we run about a dozen campaigns and the early data show promising results. We’ll continue to roll this product out slowly and carefully. Similarly we’re seeing positive early demand for marketers for ads on Instagram and we’re rolling these ads outs carefully as well.
In all of this we remained focused on the transition to mobile. Our recently launched audience network lets advertisers use Facebook targeting while extending their campaign beyond Facebook. This can improve the relevance of ad peoples see both on and off Facebook and we’re encouraged by the early response.
Finally, earlier this summer we announced the acquisition of LiveRail, a leading online video advertising platform that enables customers like MLB.com and A&E Networks to monetize their video inventory efficiently. We have a lot to do here, but with LiveRail we’re investing in tools that can improve the relevance of video ads across the web.
In summary, we’re pleased with our performance and the progress we’re making. We're the first platform that can deliver personalized marketing at scale and marketers are increasingly recognizing to great result so we can drive for them. Staying focused and executing will remain a major thing for us moving forward. Our teams know that our future success depends upon our continued acquisition and our plan is to stay focused.
Thanks. And now here is Dave.
Dave Wehner
Thanks, Sheryl. And good afternoon everyone. Q2 was a good quarter for us across our key operating and financial metrics. We generated strong revenue growth in operating margins and delivered $872 million of free cash flow and we continue to make investments to drive our core business, as well as to support our long term strategic priorities.
Let’s start with a review of our network. We are executing well on our ongoing mission to connect everyone. 829 million people use Facebook on an average day in June, up 130 million from a year ago. This represents 63% of the 1.32 billion people who used Facebook during June.
Mobile continues to be a strong driver of our growth with over 1 billion people using Facebook monthly on mobile. At the same time we’re enabling more ways for people to connect and share beyond the core Facebook app. For instance, both Instagram and Messenger have each passed over 200 million MAU and continue to grow nicely.
Turning now to the financials, total revenue in the second quarter was 2.9 billion up 61% or 59% on a constant currency basis. Total ad revenue was $2.7 billion, up 67% or 65% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue growth was strong around the world with each of our four geographic regions growing by over 60%. Mobile ad revenue was approximately 1.66 billion or 62% of ad revenue, compared to approximately $660 million or 41% of ad revenue last year.
Desktop ad revenue was up 8% year-over-year. In Q2, the average affective price per ad increased 123% compared to last year, while total ad impressions declined 25%. The decrease in ad impressions continues to be driven by the shift towards mobile usage where people are shown fewer ads compared to desktop.
The increase in the average price per ad was primarily driven by an increase in the percentage of our ads being served in News Feed. The price volume trends were generally consistent across all four reported geographic regions.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $234 million up 9% versus last year. As we have noted in the past we believe the more meaningful comparison that better reflects the organic growth rate of the payments business, comes from looking at payments volume from games specifically, which was up 1% in Q2 versus last year.
Our current games payment revenue comes entirely from desktop usage and we are seeing declines in the number of people using Facebook on desktop, a trend that will make growing this business challenging going forward. 
Turning to expenses, our Q2 GAAP expenses were $1.5 billion, up 22%, and our non-GAAP expenses were $1.2 billion, up 18%. Note that cost of revenue grew 2% on a GAAP basis and 1% on a non-GAAP basis, mainly driven by unusually high expenses in 2013 related to the transition out of certain leased data centers. This flatness in cost of revenue was the primary reason overall expenses grew relatively slowly.
Operating expenses excluding cost of revenue grew 33% on a GAAP basis and 31% on a non-GAAP basis. We ended Q2 with 7185 employees, up 36% from last year. Our Q2 GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, representing a 48% operating margin, up from 31% last year and our non-GAAP operating income was $1.7 billion, representing a 59% non-GAAP operating margin, up from 44% last year. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 43% and 36%, respectively. GAAP net income was $791 million or $0.30 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $1.1 billion or $0.42 per share.
In Q2, we spent $469 million on CapEx and generated $872 million of free cash flow. We ended Q2 with approximately $14 billion in cash and investments. This excludes the impact of the Oculus acquisition which was closed earlier this week and included am approximately $400 million cash payment.
Now looking forward, let me start by noting that the forward-looking comments I’ll share today for 2014 include the impact from the recently closed acquisition of Oculus, but exclude except where otherwise noted the impact from WhatsApp which we continue to expect will close later this year.
In terms of expenses, we expect that our total 2014 GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue and stock compensation, will likely grow in the neighborhood of 30% to 35%, and that our non-GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock compensation, will grow at a similar rate. These rates are slightly lower than our prior expectations due to the efficiencies in areas like cost of revenue and G&A. 
However, we believe that we are still in the early days of building out all of the services to maximize Facebook’s impact on the world and we intend to continue to invest aggressively in people, products and infrastructure in the second half of 2014 and beyond. Though it is premature to give a specific outlook for 2015 expenses, I wanted to note that we expect significant stock-based compensation and amortization expenses, as well as substantial incremental operating costs related to the acquisitions of Oculus and WhatsApp. This will add to our overall expenses in 2015 and subsequent periods. These costs will be incremental to core Facebook expenses, which will continue to grow significantly in 2015 as we ramp investments in people, products and infrastructure. 
For taxes, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP rates for the rest of 2014 to be similar to our Q2 rates, although these could vary widely depending on our international revenue and expense mix, and other factors, most notably the impact from acquisitions, including the expected closing of WhatsApp later this year. We continue to anticipate that 2014 CapEx will be approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We expect shares outstanding to grow from around 2.6 billion at the end of 2013 to approximately 2.9 billion at the end of 2014, again assuming WhatsApp closes by the end of the year.
Turning last to revenue. As we saw in Q2, our year-over-year growth rate declined from 72% in Q1 to 61% in Q2 or 59% on a constant currency basis. This is consistent with our comments on the Q1 call when we indicated that over the course of 2014, the year-over-year growth rates in revenue would decline meaningfully as the comps became more difficult. We expect this trend to continue over the course of the second half of the year. 
While we are excited about the long-term potential of our app initiatives like Instagram, autoplay video, and the Audience Network, we are still in the early days of building these businesses and expect their revenue contribution to remain small in the near term. We remain optimistic as ever about the long-term opportunity to grow revenue by improving the quality and relevance of our ads and increasing the value we bring to marketers through our products, tools and technologies.
In summary, we're very pleased with our overall performance in Q2 and in particular the continued growth of our mobile audience, the strength of our ads business and the investments we're making to build long-term shareholder value. 
With that, Jay, let’s open up the call for questions
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

We will now open the line for a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead.
Deborah Crawford
Please go to next question.
Operator
Next we have Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. We have our question from Eric Sheridan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Eric Sheridan - UBS
Sorry about that. I don’t know if you heard the question. But Sheryl, one on sort of Audience Network and LiveRail. Maybe you can give us a little better sense of the depth of the conversations with advertisers and what that might do to the platform longer term 2014 and beyond in terms of broadening out Facebook’s advertising effort? And second question Dave, on the Oculus and WhatsApp, is there any way to get a sense of employee counts at the companies or the pressure that we might see from OpEx going forward? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
So I’ll start. One of the goals we have, we talk about in all of these calls is to make ads more relevant for people and marketers, and increasingly with the Audience Network we have a goal to do that for publishers as well. Video is really important. It’s one of the fastest growing ad mediums out there in both desktop and mobile. So LiveRail has a leading online video advertising platform and we think we can use it to effectively expand video ads to marketers and to publishers outside of Facebook and offer greater audience reach and ability to [indiscernible] video advertisers.
When you look at the Audience Network, we’re still in really early days and we only have some publishers in our network. But we see this as an opportunity to provide greater reach for Facebook marketers and developers. Again, to improve the relevance of the ads people see both on and off Facebook.
Dave Wehner
Thanks Eric. On Oculus and WhatsApp, we’re in -- very much in investment mode on our overall business and we expect to continue to ramp investments in the core business through 2015. And like I said, we’ll be layering on top of that costs related to Oculus and WhatsApp. But we’re not getting into more specifics on the exact headcounts on those. But we believe those are significant opportunities in the long run and so we’re going to be investing aggressively accordingly.
Operator
Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Two quick questions from me. First would just be, if you could share with us any qualitative commentary about the breadth of mobile ad revenue. There is always a lot of debate back and forth about how big mobile app installs are. And if there is anything you could share with us about the breadth of these -- the breadth of mobile has kind of been changing over the last year or so? And then the follow up question would just be related to; how your conversations with advertisers are changing as people start to think collectively about their TV and video budget together. I'm just wondering if you’re starting to see your conversations with big TV advertisers start to change somewhat over the last six months or so? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
So when you think about our mobile ads, and I'm really glad you asked this question. I do think sometimes people think that mobile app install ads are all of the revenue or a great majority of revenue and they’re not. They’re only part of the mobile ads revenue. Our mobile ads revenue is pretty, it’s broad based. We have large brand advertisers, small SMBs, direct response advertisers as well as developers using our mobile ads. The mobile app install ads, which are run not only by developers but also by large companies that want to get people to install apps are growing. They remain a good part of our mobile ads revenue and we’re excited about the opportunities there. But we see our opportunities in mobile ads as much broader than just installing apps.
So the second question, I do think one of the things that’s happened in the last really year, year and a half on Facebook, is people understanding how strong the creative opportunity is. We’ve built out the technology platform and made our product investments and we’re really created particularly with the move to mobile and our ads on News Feed, an opportunity to do great creative story telling. A great recent example is the progressive baby ads if you’ve seen them. They’re really engaging and really fun, but they’re making a really important point, which is people should be buying their own insurance, but the ability for them to do that ad is based on the technology we created and also the great work they’ve done with Arnold Worldwide, their agency on the creative part.
And so I think for a long time people have thought TV whisper creative storytelling and online ads work for more targeted text based results. And I think we’re seeing that change, which means that the way people approach TV, they’ll also approach Facebook and are starting to, which makes those budgets work much better together.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Two things I wanted to ask. First Mark has been talking -- it was on your blog about testing a buy button within the platform. So I was hoping you could talk about how important you think commerce is to Facebook going forward and then perhaps also payments as well. And then secondly Sheryl, you mentioned some of the major brands that advertised during the World Cup. Do you talk about how you get the follow through from those brands, now that that major event has passed and how you keep those ad dollars on Facebook? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
So, on the buy button, we launched a small test in the U.S. only, which enables people to hit a buy button and on pages or in page post ads on Facebook. It streamlines the process of buying from our clients. No one is buying from us. We’re just streamlining the process of buying from our clients. I think commerce is really important and is a growing important part of our business as all marketer segments are growing. But I don’t think people should confuse that with Facebook selling things directly. The more people buy online, the more people buy things they discover through their mobile phones, the more people discover things from a News Feed and go on to purchase, the more important we are in driving e-commerce and I think we are increasingly important. That doesn’t mean we’re going to or have to sell products. 
Mark Zuckerberg

Yes, and I'd just add to that because some of the question was about payments that we will clearly do work in payments to accept payments for advertising and on platform and other things that we do. But just because we will do that, it doesn’t -- we still basically view ourselves as a partner to other companies in the payment space rather than trying to compete directly for that. Our main business is advertising and I think we're mostly, to the extent that we do payments, it’s going to be supportive to that. I wanted to make one more point, just related to that because I think some of the questions around payments are connected to what we’re planning on doing in the other apps outside of Facebook. So things like Messenger and WhatsApp over time, when that closes and Instagram, I really do just want to emphasize that there is a lot of work to set up the foundation for having a good business community and ecosystem and in those that we think it’s going to be years of work before those are huge businesses for us. And I'm liking where we are now on something like the Messenger, to where we were on Facebook in like 2006 or 2007, where it was primarily consumer product at that time where you really only communicated with friends. 
And a bunch of people asked us, and said that we should put ads. But before we did that we wanted to create really good organic consumer experiences for people to interact with different entities. So we created Pages, so people could interact with organic businesses. And then in order to make it so that businesses and public figures and folks would create pages, we offered Insights on different products. And we gave all those things away for free. Pages were free and continue to be free and that’s partially why we have 30 million businesses today, using Pages on the platform, and Insights, we kind of give away for free in order to enable more folks to use Pages. 
Then only after we had a good kind of organic interaction that people could and would want to interact with these different businesses and entities; that we really layer ads on top of that and start to build the business that we have today. So I just think it is worth emphasizing this because we’ve said in a number of comments that we think that some of these newer initiatives are going to ramp over time. We really do mean that. And we are serious about doing this the right way and building up new ecosystems and I think that’s for some of these apps, we’re just kind of build all the infrastructure that we need to make it be something that's scalable over time, rather than trying to have this be an impact that you will notice in the next, I don’t know, short-term period of time.
Sheryl Sandberg
To the World Cup part of your question; brands certainly use the World Cup and big events like this to launch things as they continue to as ad campaign. They also have other big events that come along as well as their own events around product launches. And so we think, obviously not every day is a World Cup, but there are lots of opportunities throughout the year and through the product cycle to work with brand advertisers in big ways.

Your next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank

I have one question for Mark on the product side and then one for Dave. Mark, so App Links just launched, if you go out a few years, how much do you think something like deep linking could increase engagement or ad effectiveness for Facebook and for those 1 billion links that you have up and running already, what are you seeing in those early tests? And then Dave, we know you don’t breakout the price versus volume metrics for Mobile, but just directionally could you give us some color on how the ad-impression growth in mobile compares with the 31% BAU growth in mobile.
Mark Zuckerberg
Sure, so I don’t have much color that’s useful to share here on App Links. It's still early. People have marked up a bunch of apps with this metadata, that allows us to search for it, but Search for Facebook is going to be a multiyear voyage and there is just so much content that is unique to the Facebook ecosystem that we can answer questions for you that really no other service can. Just like the other day I was curious about finding out which of one of my friend’s friend, like at a company. And it’s like I don’t know any other service where you can just go do that query but on Facebook you can and the secret to this is going to be basically just over a long period of time indexing all of the different content that's on Facebook in every different way.
So we started off with people. There's obviously a need to be able to find people in order to use the product and add friends and just have our core kind of ecosystem work but we're indexing more into connections and now we're getting into more of the content and it's a huge amount of contents. I think there was more than a trillion posts, which some of the search engineers on the team like to remind me is bigger than any web search corpus that’s out there. But that’s just kind of one part of the data, and we’re going to keep on doing more and more. We're going to start of focusing on stuff that’s unique to Facebook, that you couldn’t really answer those questions elsewhere. 
App Links by definition of being outside of Facebook are not going to be unique to Facebook. So we'll get to that overtime. I think it will be a valuable part of the ecosystem. But honestly we're mostly interested in that to enable value for other developers and pushing distribution to them than we are for our own search. It’s going to enable interesting ways for a developer to be able to make a set of people in their app, can share content on Facebook and then link directly to the right part of the app, and enable some engagement ads. So that way a developer can say a person was using my app and they were going to buy something but they dropped out of the checkout flow. So we’re going to have an ad that helps them link right back to the checkout flow, so that they can complete their conversion. And you want deep linking to be able to enable things like that but it’s going to take a while for it to play out with search.
Dave Wehner
Yes, and Ross on your question on mobile ads. Mobile BAU is ramping nicely, 39% growth and we’re seeing it grow nicely across all of our geographic regions. Of course mobile ads are ramping as well. In terms of pricing we don’t break it out but on the reported pricing trend, as I was, as I think I made clear, the 123% increase in price was driven by a mix shift with a higher percentage of News Feed ads. And new feed ads are really effective for marketers and that includes mobile News Feed ads as well. They deliver a lot of value for marketers. That’s why they’re getting a higher price in the auction, because the price of ads really correlates to the value that they create. And we continue to focus on making those ad units better and better, more relevant and targeted for the people who use Facebook as well as for marketers. And we’re seeing good results. Marketers are getting good ROI and they’re coming back and spending more with us. So we’re pleased about all of that.
Operator
Your next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
I’d like to follow up a little bit on the ad pricing, obviously up 122%. Sheryl maybe you can comment a little bit about the organic growth for like for ads there? And do you see opportunities to continue to see nice pricing growth as you look out the next couple of years? And then as you think about the new ad formats, video and other things, would you think that could continue to drive pricing higher, meaning new ad formats could drive even more value than the existing ads that you have on Facebook? Thank you.
Dave Wehner
Justin, its Dave. Just following up on that, in terms of the pricing as I said, it’s really about the mix shift towards the News Feed ads is what’s driving the overall reported pricing trends but we are focused on making our ads all better and driving better returns for our marketers. And we see that reflected in the price. There's other things, for instance. We’re making our right hand column ads more effective by changing the format of those. Those will be higher value to our marketers because they’ll drive more engagement. And it will -- but there’ll be fewer of them. So that will impact pricing.
But everything that we’re doing is about trying to drive more value for our marketers, as well as trying to drive more relevant ad experiences for the people who use Facebook. And if we’re successful in doing that, we’ll drive ROI for the marketers, we’ll drive good experiences and we’ll get good pricing.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks. Two questions please. Anything you could share with us with regards to China and efforts to develop more of a presence there? And then maybe a follow up question on David Marcus coming over and somebody with a huge payments background running the Messaging product, it’s kind of like hiring -- signing Messi up to the Miami Heat, like it’s little of an odd transition. Are we looking at it wrong? Is there any particular reason why he wouldn’t be more focused on payments? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
So I’ll talk about China. Our mission is to enable everyone in the world to share and connect. And so, we’ve been studying and learning about China for a number of years and we remain very interested. We are seeing Chinese based companies use Facebook to reach the global audience and we are -- we think we have an important opportunity just with their export market and we’re focused on that for now.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yes, and I mean on messenger and David, I think he is just a real talented product generalist. He's done a number of different things, including in his past he ran and built a messaging company. Most recently clearly he ran a very important company and I think was pretty successful in helping get really good results there. Messenger will have -- over time there will be some overlap between that and payments. But I guess what I'm just trying to say is two things. One is, the payments piece will be a part of what will help drive the overall success and help people share with each other and interact with businesses. But we’re really focused on the interactions overall, rather than the mechanism and David shares that view.
And the second thing is just that there's so much ground work that we need to do in order to make it so that people are communicating with businesses and public figures and entities in these other apps that we’re building, which is part of the business ecosystem. And I really can’t underscore that enough that we have a lot of work to do and we could take the cheap and easy approach and just try to put ads in or do payments and make some money in the short term. But we’re not going to do that. So to the extent that any of your models or anything reflects that we might be doing that, I would strongly encourage you hereon to just that, because we’re not going to and we’re going to take time to do this in the way that we think that’s going to be right over multiple years.

Our next question comes from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital. Your line is open.
Neil Doshi - CRT Capital
Sheryl, I think attribution it could be a very big opportunity, especially for local businesses to help them realize ROIs. People going from online to offline. With 30 million businesses now on Facebook, how are you helping those businesses realize the online to offline conversation to Facebook, to drive more dollars going to local businesses? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
I agree strongly that this is a huge opportunity. Our goal with all of our clients, from the biggest to the smallest is to drive their business results and as usually selling a product, sometimes online but often in stores. We’ve done a lot of work over the last year to measurement. We talk about measurement in all of these calls and that’s because investing measurement and connecting not just some online to online, but online to offline is super important. Because that we can prove those results to our marketers large and small, they'll continue to invest.
We think we have a real advantage here, that we have real identity. We have real identity across the desktop and across mobile. And we have found ways, in very privacy protective ways to work with third parties -- third party users of data to connect offline sales to online ads and those investments remain a very big focus for us.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ken Sena with Evercore. Your line is open.
Ken Sena - Evercore
So you mentioned over 1 billion users, 80% of app developers use the Facebook login on iOS and Android. When we think about Facebook as a platform, can you provide any stats on the number of developers who are starting to build their experience on Facebook? And then how do they need to be to see things like app linking, data formats, auto play video or other? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg
We’ve shifted to this model on mobile where developers aren’t really building their apps inside Facebook, right. So we’re not an operating system. We had a little bit more of this dynamic with Ken, just on desktop, but now we’ve shifted the strategy to helping developers with three things, build, grow and monetize their apps. And we have a number of services that developers can plug into their apps to help out with all three of those. So for example we have -- and for helping people build their app, we do things like login and we have services like parse that help developers build apps more easily. That stuff is all great for helping folks build social apps in a way that's faster than they could have otherwise.
In terms of growth, I think we offer tools like sharing and messaging that people can enable. Our developer can enable their users to be able to organically spread the app. We also have things like app installs and engagement ads that make it so that developers and pay to increase that. And then on the monetize side, we are rolling out the Audience Network and we have -- and then I guess on canvas we have things like payments to help developers monetize and that’s an increasing focus as well and Audience Network is new and it’s getting started. So it’s -- again it’s one of the things that will be pretty slow for a while but we really want do a great. But that’s going to be an important part to this as well. So I think that’s kind of how you want to think about developers. And right now we’re really proud about 80% of the top developers, the value and touching a part of our platform. We obviously want to get the last 20, but we’re excited about that the progress so far.
Sheryl Sandberg
And in terms of those developers using our different ad products, as we say we roll out slowly and slowly. Usually we pick a handful of advertisers to work with us, certainly what we’ve been doing on autoplay video ads. But in time our goal is to make our ad products available to all of our marketer segments and that’s what we'll work on. So over the long run, any developer, any small or large business, whether they're using other parts of our platform or not, would be able to purchase any type of our ads.
Operator
Your next question comes from Brian Nowak with SIG. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak - SIG
I have two. The first one is on the video ads. You mentioned it’s the early days on video advertising and just wondering, if you could talk to some of your early learnings, what you’re pleased with and where you see areas for improvement and which metrics your gauging to determine when to undergo a broader roll out. And then secondly on the -- I think you mentioned the larger higher quality LiveRail desktop ads. There has been some changes in experimentation around that inventory. How does the advertiser receptivity bend to those ad units compared to the old LiveRail and where are those dollars coming from? Is that new dollars to the platform or are they are shifting from old sponsored stories or LiveRail. Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg
So I’ll talk about video and then Sheryl can answer on the right hand column. The biggest thing that we want to make sure is that quality is really good as we roll this out and that’s going to be the same on all of these different initiatives. And one of the reasons why we’re optimistic about video ad is that -- in autoplay specifically is the format for both organic and paid content is that you’re scrolling through a feed and you -- if the content catches your eye and you like it, then it’s playing and it's loaded and you can just easily continue watching it or otherwise the person has complete control, and if they don’t like it, they can just keep on going through it. So the content has to be really good and we think that that’s going to be a real high quality experience.
There are still a number of things that we really want to prove and make sure that we're doing well here. We want to make sure that when people are see an autoplay video, that’s not only paid content. We want a lot of that to be organic content as well. So we're trying to ramp up the amount of public content and content that people share at that same time as we're ramping up on the autoplay video ads.
We also want to make sure that this doesn’t consume a lot of people’s data. So we're just being really careful about how we handle that and getting that really right across different markets, that’s going to be a different thing that we want to be really sensitive to. So it really just -- in a word this all comes down to quality and we’re more focused on just making sure that this is the right and best thing over time than something in the near term. 
And that I think is a theme of a lot of the areas that we’ve talked about, whether it’s new apps that we are building, things like Messenger or Instagram and what we're doing there, working with Audience Network, which we just announced or video ads.
There's just a lot of things that we're super excited about and obviously will talk about them publically because we’re working with partners and we’re excited to talk about them here as well because we do really think that these are going to be great things to help build businesses overtime. But we want to make sure that we don’t get ahead of ourselves because these things are early and quality is the most important thing for growing this the right way overtime.
Sheryl Sandburg 

On the right hand column redesign; the redesign was driven by making the ads more consistent with News Feed which results in fewer but larger ads. But they just don’t come from any one place and I think when you think about Facebook's growing part in the ad ecosystem, you really have to think about ad dollars shifting online as the majority of the driver of budget shifting and ad dollars coming on to mobile. We are pleased that we see higher engagement rates from the people who were shown in new ads compared to the old, which makes us optimistic that these are more valuable.
Operator
Your next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies

Maybe a question in a different direction regarding privacy and maybe you could just walk us through your current thoughts. The reason I asked is because Facebook recently introduced the anonymous login product at F8 this year and new services like save or hidden from friends unless users specifically opt in, can you just give us a sense, is this kind of a change of a strategic shift in thinking or tone with regards to privacy? Thank you so much.
Mark Zuckerberg

This is - it’s a really important question, I think somebody is misunderstood about Facebook. One of the things that we focused on the most is creating private faces for people to share things and have interactions that they couldn’t have had elsewhere. So if you go back to the very beginning of Facebook, we’re more than 10 years. There were blogs and things where you could be completely public and there were emails right. So you could circulate something completely privately.
So there was no space where you could share with just your friends and have that -- it wasn’t a completely private experience, but it's not completely public and that it's 100 or 150 of the people that you care about. And creating that space, which was a space that had the kind of privacy that no one had ever seen before was what enabled and continues to enable the kind of interactions and the content that people feel comfortable sharing in this network that don’t exist in other places in the world. 
So we're comfortably looking for new opportunities to create new dynamics like that and open up new different private spaces for people where they can then feel comfortable sharing and having the freedom to express something you otherwise wouldn’t be able to. It’s one of the reasons why I'm personally so excited about messaging. Because like right now I think at some level, there are only so many photos that you’re going to want to share with all of your friends. We still think that there's more to do there but it's like the amount of messaging and how quickly we see that growing, it's crazy. Because like there is just a lot more that people want to express and that they need the tools to express with smaller groups of people, not just one person at a time but smaller groups as well. Things like anonymous login totally unlocks different behavior. So how many times would you want to sign in to an app but you don’t necessarily want to share a lot of information with that app but if you can do it anonymously, we think that can unlock of lot of different interactions and experiences that people want to have. So we do our jobs as like very fundamentally providing people with these spaces and tools, which I think is very different from how a lot of people think about what Facebook is but it’s an important thing to think about how we do our product development.
Operator

Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Colin Sebastian - Robert Baird

I have a couple of questions as well. First on mobile advertising and ad loads, just curious what you are seeing in terms of the ad load thresholds? Is that you are at the point now where the relevancy and quality of ads means that you can take that up perhaps a little bit? And then secondly on Oculus and Virtual Reality applications, how should we think about the pace of development of this technology and the potential integration with Facebook’s applications? Thank you.
Dave Wehner
I can take care of the mobile ad load question. So ad load is really one of dozens of factors that we focus on. Others are of course the quality, the relevance and then the prominence of the ads. And we monitor the sentiment and engagement of people, engaging in News Feed and we’re really pleased with the strength of sentiment and engagement as we’ve ramped up News Feed apps and we feel like we’re in a good position, given where we are with that to continue to grow the advertising business, while driving good user experience. So we’re in a good place on that.
Mark Zuckerberg
I can talk about Oculus. So we’re really excited about this the acquisition just closed earlier this week and we’re really excited to welcome that team. They’re extremely talented and they’ve pulled off something that people have been talking about for a really long time and now it’s possible, given the technology that this team has developed. And this hits on a different part of our strategy, which -- the way that I organize my remarks every quarter are around these 10 year goals and themes that we have for the Company, connecting everyone, understanding the world, helping to build the knowledge economy and these future platforms. So when I'm talking about how I think things like the businesses that we’re talking about are further out than you think, I think that this stuff is actually even further out than that.
But there are huge opportunities to build the next generation of computing platform. When mobile was getting defined we were basically just getting founded, in 2004. The first Smartphone came out and 2003. And we have mostly been a company that has played on top of the different mobile foundations that other companies have built. And one of the things that I care really deeply about on some of the tenures arc for the company is having a different relationship to whatever the next set of computing platforms are and investing accordingly now to make sure that when the next set of computing platforms get defined, we can help define what the next generation of computing is going to be.
So I think virtual reality, augmented reality, vision, some of the AI work that we’re doing, is all going to play into this in an important way. And I just think while I was emphasizing that we’re early on some of those businesses and we’re not going to rush those. The flip side to the coin is to emphasize that we’re also going to spend a lot and invest very heavily in a bunch of these things to do it right over the long term. And so I think David pointed out that we expect to continue investing heavily and that our costs will increase. And I just want to underscore that as well, because I expect that continue to be true and it’s not that we’re necessarily going to go out and have a lot more new strategic priorities, but we expect to go very deep on the priorities that we have to make sure that we completely nail them all, whether it’s a five year or a 10 year time frame.
Deborah Crawford
Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
Operator
Your last question will come from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
Thanks for taking my question. Mark you talked about the focus on public content. Does that include a focus on exclusive content that we should be expecting to pay for or have revenue share agreements with the content with some key public figures? Separately on Search, I think you still have a quite a large team working on it, including Search, but our greatest point, we haven’t seen many changes since the original played the graph as part of the launch. So when should we expect to see those improvements and how would you rank Search in terms of with your priorities? And then finally just a quick housekeeping question; David, the D&A continues to trend down over the past few quarters. Why is that happening and should we expect that to continue?
Dave Wehner
I can take the D&A question first if you’d like. So ultimately depreciation is going to track more folks closely against the CapEx. So in the first half of the year we’ve been aggressively investing in the things we want to invest and that includes infrastructure. So CapEx is up 40% in the first half of the year. There are some investments that we’re making notably in the Iowa datacenter, also the new headquarters we’re building where those facilities have not gone into service. So they’re not hitting depreciation yet. So, we’re making the big investments in CapEx that will ultimately flow through in Depreciation. So I think in short the answer to your question is we’ll see depreciation come up as those things come online.
Mark Zuckerberg
And I guess I can answer the other. So on public content, we actually do get a lot of exclusive content. We don’t pay for it. But I mean so -- this week for example I think Shakira hit her 100 million fans moment on Facebook. And part of the reason why some of these public figures and political leaders and folks have such big following is because they’re constantly providing insight into their lives and unique types of contents that other folks -- that you can’t get anywhere else. And there is a format that I think make sense for Facebook. It’s not and you’re not going to come to Facebook to watch a movie or watch a whole TV show. That’s really long form stuff. But I mean in the modes that we have today in our service that kind of attraction is the best place for a number of types of content like this that we’re starting to see that we get.
So we’re mostly focused on driving success for our partners, where they are news organizations that are publishing content that people share or public figures and individuals who are engaging directly on Facebook. Our view is that the more success in distribution and engagement we can drive for them, the better the content and the quality that they’re going to invest in building for Facebook. And types of search, I think -- I mentioned in my opening remarks that this quarter I think for the first time we are over on average 1 billion searches a day, which is awesome and it's something that we’re really proud of and have worked a lot on, especially given that we generally found that people search a little bit less on average on mobile. So we went through a period where in order to have that increase, we had to like do some really good work and make it a lot faster and improve ranking and do a lot of the basic things that needed to get done.
There is just so much more content that needs to get indexed. So if you want to go find that Shakira video that I was just talking about, I don’t know if today the product fully delivers on that but it will soon and in the next six months we’re going to be able to do that and then if we do well and them a year later we’re going to have more content in the system and be able to index that better.
So it’s an ongoing thing. There is huge potential. There are a lot of questions that only Facebook can answer, that other services aren’t going to be able to answer for you. We’re really committed to investing in that and building out this unique service over the long-term. And I think at some point there is going to be an inflection where it starts to be useful for a lot of used cases. But that may still be years away. But we’re just committed to doing this investment and making this right.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Jake and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you very much.
Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.
Deborah Crawford
Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook’s first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Sheryl Sandberg, COO and David Ebersman, CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today’s press release and our annual report on form 10-K filed with the SEC.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
During this call we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.
And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining today. This was a very busy quarter and a strong start to 2014. We continued to grow our community in size and engagement, with nearly 1.28 billion people now using Facebook each month and almost 63% visiting daily.
We also reached new milestones as a mobile company, with more than one billion monthly actives on mobile and almost 55% of our daily actives only connecting on mobile.
When you look at our business performance, we’ve also made some good progress. Our total revenue grew 72% year-over-year. Our advertising grew 82%, our strongest annual growth rate in nearly three years. And mobile accounted for 59% of our advertising revenue.
These results show Facebook’s business is strong and growing, and we’re in a great position to continue making progress towards our mission.
This quarter we made a number of big investments in our future. We reached agreements to acquire WhatsApp and Oculus, and we announced our new Connectivity Lab that’s focused on developing technologies to expand Internet access around the world. These are important efforts that we believe will help us continue making progress towards our mission over the long term.
But as this quarter shows, we’re also staying focused on execution, and carefully improving our core products and business. Execution gives us the strength to bet on the future, and our success over the long term depends on us serving our community today and delivering against our current strategy.
So, with that in mind, I’d like to run through our progress this quarter towards our three big company goals; connecting everyone, understanding the world and building the knowledge economy.
Connecting everyone is about making Internet services available to everyone in the world, and allowing everyone to connect with the people and things that they care about.
Our strategy for connecting everyone is based on two approaches. The first is about giving people new apps for sharing different kinds of content with different people. Today our apps are at different stages of maturity.
Our core Facebook app has an audience of over one billion people, and has become an essential sharing infrastructure for the world. We’re currently focused on building a great business around this, and our continuing revenue growth on mobile this quarter shows our strong momentum here.
For the next set of apps like Messenger, Instagram and hopefully soon WhatsApp, the current priority is growth. Messenger and Instagram both reached 200 million monthly actives this quarter. We believe these apps have a lot of room to grow and will start to be important businesses in the future, but monetization isn’t our near-term priority here.
And for the new apps that we’re building as part of our Creative Labs effort, we’re still in the very early stages of development. We’re working hard to develop the technical foundations for these services so that we can rapidly launch new products and then refine them based on the initial feedback from our community.
For Creative Labs projects that demonstrate a lot of value, our next priority will be to grow them to reach 100 million people, before we start developing them into significant businesses. Now we’re pleased by the early reaction to Paper, our first app from Creative Labs, and we expect this to be a good test case for our strategy.
The longer term part of our strategy for connecting everyone is focused on Internet.org, our effort to make affordable basic Internet services available to the entire world. We recently reached 100 million monthly actives in India, and through Internet.org we’re looking to build on this kind of success.
We’ve already started to deliver results. By partnering with mobile operators in the Philippines and Paraguay, we’ve doubled the number of people using mobile data with our partners and brought almost three million more people onto the Internet.
Our early tests and research into new technologies such as drones and other infrastructure to connect people are promising. And over the long term we also expect WhatsApp to play an important part in connecting everyone by offering a simple, fast and reliable messaging system that could be as ubiquitous as Facebook one day. We’ll have more to share after the deal closes.
Next, let’s talk about understanding the world. Understanding the world is about using Facebook to build up long term knowledge about the world and helping to answer questions for people that no other service can.
Next week Facebook holds our fifth f8 conference, the main event for our developer community. We do this because even with all the experiences we’re building, we understand that there will always be more social experiences that we can’t build. So we want to keep serving developers better, and to help them build, grow and monetize their apps.
We’ve made good progress here. On mobile, App Installs has been one of our best performing ad products, driving over 350 million installs to date. Over 60% of the top grossing apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play use Mobile App Ads, which is pretty impressive performance for a product that launched in January last year.
On desktop, games continue to be popular on our platform and over the last twelve months desktop game developers generated more than $3 billion in payments volume on Facebook.
It's worth noting that even though our mobile and desktop products seem completely different, they're both delivering the same value to developers; the ability to reach a large targeted audience. That's what we provide, and regardless of the format we will continue to improve this value.
We see a big opportunity to continue improving the relevancy of the ads people see on and off Facebook, to help mobile developers better monetize their apps, and to help provide greater reach for marketers. I look forward to sharing more details next week at f8.
Finally, let’s talk about our efforts to build the knowledge economy. Building the knowledge economy is about building out the technology platforms the world needs for the future, so everyone can use information to do their jobs better.
Advertising and the ability to reach people more broadly is one of the most important technology platforms for achieving this, and we're investing a lot to serve four major kinds of partners: small businesses, brands, developers and e-commerce partners.
After introducing News Feed ads, which increased the supply of ads in our system, our recent efforts have primarily focused on improving the relevance and quality of these ads.
To do this, we’ve been working to improve the tools we provide for marketers, so they have access to better targeting capabilities, simpler ad products and more useful measurement tools.
Our approach is less about developing new products for marketers and more about improving our existing ones and helping businesses to use them efficiently. Our goal is to make our ads as interesting as organic content on Facebook, so that more people find ads useful and businesses can engage effectively with our community and grow.
Our most recent data shows that this approach is working well, and we continue to be really encouraged by the feedback we’re seeing from people about our ads. There is still more work to be done here, but we’ve shown that we can continue to serve our community well while also growing a healthy business.
So that’s my update on how we’ve been executing against our strategy over the last quarter. It’s been a busy quarter and a strong one. We’re proud of our progress as a company and everything that we’re accomplishing today.
In large part this is due to the incredible quality of our team, and I’m very grateful for the support of everyone here at Facebook, as well as our stockholders and partners, as we continue working to achieve our mission.
In addition to thanking our employees, I'd also like to thank one person in particular: David Ebersman, who is stepping down as CFO after almost five years. David has been a great partner in building Facebook.
He has set the right tone about operating efficiently. He has set us up to make the long term investments we need. And most importantly, he has built an incredibly strong team, including Dave Wehner, who will be our next CFO. 
I've learned a lot from David, both personally and professionally, and I'm grateful for everything he has done to help make the world more open and connected.
Thanks, and now here’s Sheryl.
Sheryl Sandberg
Thanks Mark and hi everyone. Before I start, I want to join Mark in thanking David for being an extraordinary partner and friend over these past five years. As Mark said, he has contributed so much to our company and I've learned so much, personally, working with him.
Great people build great teams and that's what David has done. And so I’m also really excited to continue working with Dave Wehner as he steps into his new role as our CFO.
We are off to an outstanding start in 2014. Our total revenues were up 72% year-over-year and our advertising revenue growth accelerated to 82%. That’s our strongest year-over-year advertising growth rate in nearly three years.
We’re really pleased with these results and the level of execution in our business. The team is staying focused on each element of our monetization strategy: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers who advertise with us, and investing in our ad products.
Mobile continues to be a big driver for us – and a big opportunity. Mobile comprised 59% of our ad revenue in the quarter, up six percentage points from Q4. We continue to believe that this is because Facebook has the best mobile ad product in the market.
We also continue to grow the number of marketers using Facebook and saw growth from existing advertisers as well. Our growth is very broad-based and coming from all types of marketers, with particular strength from SMB and direct response.
We saw strong performance this quarter from verticals such as mobile gaming, e-commerce, and consumer-packaged goods.
I am especially pleased with what we are seeing and hearing from clients around the world as they shift budgets to online, to mobile, and to Facebook. One recent powerful example is Sport Chek, Canada’s largest sports retailer.
They recently decided to pull their paper circulars, which their company have relied on as its primary ad vehicle for 92 years for two weeks and replace them completely with digital spend, a majority of which was on Facebook.
During those two weeks, national in-store sales grew 12% year-over-year and in-store sales of the items they promoted on Facebook grew 23%. As a result, they are going to continue with their tests and their goal is to transition more than 25% of their print spend to digital and Facebook in the next year.
And last week I was in Europe meetings with clients, agencies, SMBs and developers and what I heard from them was how FB was becoming increasingly important in driving their businesses.
Investing to improve and expand our ad products remains a very important priority for us. Our goal is to continue to develop new ways to help marketers reach their customers.
We’ve done this over the last couple of years by enhancing our targeting capabilities, simplifying our ad products, and improving our measurement tools. I’ll touch on each of these three areas.
First, targeting. Along with Facebook’s reach and scale, marketers value our proprietary targeting to help them reach the right customers and create more personalized and, therefore, more efficient and effective ad campaigns. Ten times more marketers are now using our Custom Audiences targeting feature compared to last year.
To share just one recent example, Ben & Jerry’s wanted to drive more sales from its classic flavors. They used a wide range of our targeting capabilities, including Custom Audiences and Partner Categories, to reach premium ice cream buyers.
Their campaign reached 14 million people, roughly 90% on mobile and drove an 8.1% sales lift from those consumers. As more marketers use our targeting tools, our ads become more relevant for our users and drive even better results for marketers.
Second, we are simplifying and enhancing our ad tools for the over one million advertisers on Facebook. The tools that were previously available to only the biggest and most sophisticated advertisers like Custom Audiences and Partner Categories are now available in our self-service ad creation process.
By making these tools more accessible, we believe we can grow the number of advertisers on our platform and improve their results. Additionally, for direct response marketers, we’ve added more specific calls to action in our ads, including “buy now” or “install now” buttons that greatly improve the efficacy of these ads.
Finally, we’re also really pleased with the results we’re seeing from our investments in measurement tools. Our online conversion measurement tools enable our direct response advertisers to measure the impact their Facebook ad campaigns have on online sales. And, we recently launched new offline conversion tools to measure in-store sales, which have yielded positive initial results.
Our ongoing focus will continue to be on improving the quality, relevance and performance of our ads and demonstrating value to marketers. We believe we still have a lot of opportunity to generate future returns by continuing to focus in these areas.
We also have significant opportunities to develop newer products like premium video, ads on Instagram and our recently launched ad network test. Our initial efforts show a lot of promise and we’ve gotten good feedback from marketers in all of these areas. But, it’s still very early and we don't expect meaningful contributions from these projects this year.
To summarize, our ads business is performing very well. I want to take a minute to congratulate and thank our teams all around the world and our ads engineering, product and design teams on the progress we have made.
I also want to thank our clients, agencies, PMDs, and other partners, who work with us every day to use our platform to build their relationships with their customers to create personalized marketing at scale.
It’s an exciting time for us as more marketers around the world gain conviction in the results they can achieve on Facebook. We have a great opportunity to build the world’s first platform for personalized marketing at scale.
It’s early in that journey and we are going to stay focused on making the right investments in our ads business and executing against our plan.
Thanks everyone, and now here’s David.
David Ebersman
Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Before I dive into the numbers, I wanted to say a few words about my decision to step down as CFO.
This was a hard decision for me because of how much I love Facebook and all the people I work with here. In particular, I can’t thank Mark and Sheryl enough for their friendship and support and for letting me be a part of their team. I’m confident that Facebook’s best days lie ahead and I’m excited about the path Mark and Sheryl are leading the company on.
My decision’s a personal one based on my desire to get back into health care where I spent my entire career before Facebook. And, after ten years as a CFO, half of them here, I’m ready for a different role and challenge.
Right now feels like a good time for this change. The business is doing well, the foundation is solid, and in Dave Wehner we have a terrific successor who’s up to speed and ready to go.
I have complete confidence in Dave and the rest of the Finance team. Dave will formally take over me in June and he’ll take my place on the next earnings call, though I plan to stay with the company through September to ensure a smooth transition.
I also want to thank our shareholders for your partnership and support. Now to the quarter.
Q1 was a strong quarter for us across the business. We increased our revenue growth rate, expanded operating margins, delivered free cash flow of over $900 million, and continued to make investments to position the company for near-term and long-term growth. Let’s start with some people metrics.
The number of people using Facebook on an average day in March grew to 802 million, up 137 million from a year ago. As Mark mentioned, this daily number represents almost 63% of the 1.28 billion people who used Facebook during the month. And overall engagement remains strong.
Additionally, these stats don’t include Instagram, which now has more than 200 million monthly active users, showing the remarkable progress by the team. Two years ago this month, when the acquisition was announced, Instagram had fewer than 22 million monthly actives.
Turning now to the financials. Q1 total revenue was $2.50 billion, up 72% versus Q1 last year, and total ad revenue was $2.27 billion, up 82%. Ad revenue growth was strong around the world, with each of our four geographic regions growing by over 70%.
Mobile ad revenue was approximately $1.3 billion, compared to around $377 million in Q1 last year, and notably mobile ad revenue was up 7% sequentially, despite the seasonal benefits in Q4. Desktop ad revenue in Q1 was up 8% compared to Q1 last year.
In Q1, the average effective price per ad displayed increased 118% year-over-year while total ad impressions declined 17%. The decrease in ad impressions was due to factors including the continued shift towards mobile use, where people are shown fewer ads compared to desktop.
The increase in average price per ad was primarily driven by a mix shift with more ads being shown in News Feed. News Feed ads have significantly higher engagement, click through rates, and price per ad compared to right hand column ads, so a higher proportion of ads appearing in News Feed drives up the overall average price per ad.
The price volume trends were pretty consistent across our four geographic regions.
Total Payments and Other Fees revenue was $237 million, up 11% versus Q1 last year. However, the more meaningful comparison, that better reflects the organic growth we saw in the Payments business, comes from looking at Payments volume from Games specifically, which was up 1% in Q1 compared to Q1 last year, down from the 8% year-over-year growth rate we saw in Q4.
As we’ve discussed before, the shift to mobile is a significant headwind since our Games Payments revenue comes from desktop only, where usage is flat or declining, so growing this business going forward will be challenging.
Turning to expenses, our Q1 GAAP expenses were $1.4 billion, up 32%, and our non-GAAP expenses were $1.1 billion, up 26%. Our headcount increased 39% from a year ago.
Our Q1 GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, representing a 43% operating margin, and our non-GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, representing a 55% margin, up from 39% last year.
While the margin improvement was helped by some non-recurring items that drove up costs in Q1 last year, we’re pleased that the increase in margins came mostly from cost of revenue and G&A.
As planned, we’ve created efficiencies in infrastructure and administration while continuing to aggressively grow our investment in R&D along with marketing and sales to drive future performance.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 40% and 36%, respectively. GAAP net income was $642 million or $0.25 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $885 million or $0.34 per share.
In Q1, we spent $363 million on CapEx and generated $922 million in free cash flow. We ended Q1 with $12.6 billion in cash and investments.
Now, looking forward. First, I want to note that the forward-looking comments I’ll share today do not reflect any impact from the recently announced acquisitions of WhatsApp and Oculus, neither of which has closed. After the deals close, we’ll update our guidance as appropriate.
In terms of expenses, consistent with what we’ve said previously, we’re planning that our total 2014 GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue and stock comp, will likely grow in the neighborhood of 35% to 40%, and that non-GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock comp, will likely grow in the neighborhood of 40% to 45%.
For taxes, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP rates for the rest of 2014 to be similar to or a bit higher than our Q1 rates, although this could vary widely depending upon our international revenue and expense mix, and other factors including the impact from acquisitions.
We continue to anticipate our 2014 CapEx will be approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We also continue to expect shares outstanding for calculating EPS to grow from around 2.6 billion at year-end 2013 by 2% to 2.5% in 2014 excluding the two large deals we’ve announced.
Those deals once closed will add another 207 million shares, as well as additional unvested RSUs that will affect our share count over the subsequent four to five years.
Turning last to ad revenue. As you know, our year-over-year comparables will get more challenging going forward from here because of the timing of the ramp up of News Feed ads in 2013.
As the comps become more difficult, we continue to expect that over the rest of 2014, our year-over-year ad revenue growth rates will decline from the Q1 rate and be meaningfully lower by the end of the year.
That being said, we believe, we are still in the early stages of building our ads business, and we remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term opportunity to grow revenue impressively by improving the quality and relevance of our ads and increasing the value we bring to marketers.
In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year. We're very pleased with how well our ads performed. The strong marketer interest in our ads platform particularly on mobile and the investments we're making to build long-term shareholder value.
Now let's open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator

We will now open the line for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs

Great. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, Mark or Sheryl, if you can share with us your vision of payments for Facebook, and how the Company might be able to play a role in reducing the friction that exists today when users are trying to engage in mobile e-commerce.
And then the follow-up question was just going to be if you could share with us what inning do you think we are in, in terms of improving the relevancy of the ads that you are showing? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
On payments, our payments business has been important in supporting some of the developer activity on Facebook, primarily games. So we continue to be interested in that.
I guess really important to know that, our advertising business is very relevant for e-commerce and that doesn't depend on taking payments and it doesn't depend on a payment strategy because we provide a really great opportunity for marketers to find customers who are then going to go ahead and buy their products both online and offline.
In terms of relevance, I think we are in really early innings. I think people can see it from their own experience. Those people I talk to and certainly the data we have across the base of people use Facebook suggest that the ads are getting more relevant, but there is a long way to go.
Our goal is that every time you open newsfeed, every time you look at Facebook, you see something whether it's from consumers, or whether it's from marketers, that really delights you, that you're genuinely happy to see.
I think we hit that more than we used to with our ads, but I think the truth is we still have a long way to go to hit that bar and that's the bar we are striving for.

Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan

Great. Thanks for taking the question. David, just wanted to ask you a little bit more about margins, in particular. If we look at this quarter, it looks like the incremental margins here are 78% or so.
So, I was hoping you could drill down a little more just on the drivers within cost of revenues and how you are thinking about the sustainability of that going forward.
And is the 40% to 45% growth that you mentioned in non-GAAP OpEx, is that taking into account the acquisitions at all? Just thinking about how you can get to that level of spend given what you are starting the year. Thanks
David Ebersman
Yeah. Thanks for the question Doug. I think Q1 is traditionally a light spending quarter for us because we budget with an annual cycle and often it takes some time to sort of ramp up the new program. So I don't think it's surprising that Q1 year-over-year increase would come in a little lighter than we expect for the full year.
Additionally there were some one-time things that benefited the quarter, that kept expenses down particularly in cost of revenue as we continue to exit lease data centers and sort of amend our supply chain.
I think that going forward our expectation was and remains the 40% to 45% growth excluding the impact from the acquisitions. So, we will update that guidance once the integration plans are clearer and have a better sense for what those spend patterns will look like.
In general in terms of margins, the comments I would make are that, we don’t have a quarter-to-quarter target margin that we're managing closely to. To do so, would require varying our spend patterns as revenue changes up and down over time.
And I think that's the wrong way to focus on how you spend your money in the company. Our priority is really to try and make investments that are high quality that drive the creation of value and makes the business better.
And since many of those investments take a longer period to mature, we want to be able to think about our spend increases over a longer term horizon.
And as you can see looking back at the last couple of years and then our plans for this year, there has been a pretty steady rate at which we've been growing spend particularly in R&D and marketing and sales where we really want to focus on making sure we're growing smartly and thoughtfully at a rate we can manage wisely and doesn't get ahead of our ability to manage it.
On cost of revenue and G&A what you can see in the Q1 numbers is the fruits of a lot of labor trying to manage those parts of the business really efficiently and free up resources to invest elsewhere.
So, I think we've always believed that Facebook has the opportunity to be a sustainably high margin business and we continue to believe that, noting that there were some individual items that helped us in Q1.

The next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford Bernstein
I think for Mark, how do you think about the evolution of browser technology, HTML5, and development tools versus native apps? If you look two to three years out, do you think native apps could finally become less important for many use cases? Or, in other words, maybe you guys were not wrong when you tried HTML5, you were just too early. Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yeah, well timing matters a lot and so, I do think that there's nothing wrong with the standard of HTML5 technically. I think a lot of what we see is what the main platform providers want to push as the standard for developing on their own platforms.
And what we've seen is that both Apple and Google have really favored and made it easier to build high quality experiences in their own proprietary formats rather than the open web format.
So, while our bias for a number of reasons would have been to have really pushed on HTML5 and I don't want to sound like we've walked away from this because a large number of people access Facebook from the mobile web and I don't know if we break that out specifically but it's quite a large number of people.
So, we're continuing to develop that, but for the foreseeable future, we see the best path to continuing to deliver great experiences by working on the native app experiences that we have now.

The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric Sheridan - UBS
Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations, David, on your future endeavors, as well. Mark, maybe a quick question for you about the way in which you think Facebook, and the various applications Facebook is developing also, move towards a communication ecosystem longer term.
A big picture question on where the various applications go, the ones that are in the process of being acquired and the ones you are developing organically.
And then second question, to use the baseball analogy again, as you continue to take ad impressions out of the Facebook platform, wonder if we should think about where you get to longer term on a level of ad impressions that you think are the perfect mix for balancing engagement and monetization, and what inning we are in that process.
Mark Zuckerberg
Sure. I think I can probably take both of those. So in terms of building out a whole communication ecosystem, the way that we think about the new apps and products that we're building is that people want to share all kinds of different content with all kinds of different audiences.
Right so, sometimes you want to have one-on-one conversation or text or chat or voice call up to having a small group conversation to communicating, updating all your friends and something at once. And sometimes there is really good public content, whether it’s news or premium video or things like that.
At the intersection of each type of content and each audience, we think that there is a really compelling experience to be built. And Facebook historically is focused on friends and public content, now with Messenger and WhatsApp we're taking a couple of different approaches towards more private content as well.
You're going to see us do more things in more private content I think, I don’t know that’s an ecosystem that's growing incredibly quickly and also that speaks to why WhatsApp and Messenger are both growing independently quickly is because they actually serve pretty different used cases within private sharing and private content.
In terms of our investments, I think you want to look at it, I kind of outline this in my remarks, but I think it's important enough to say again.
There are different stages of maturity for the different things that we're doing. So, the Facebook app by itself is the furthest along and more than a billion people use it and it's not only one of the most used apps, but it's the most used app it's also at the core of our business.
Then the second set of apps that we have are Messenger, Instagram and soon WhatsApp and you know Messenger and Instagram are each now greater than 200 million active users. I think the WhatsApp folks independently announced, I think it was yesterday that they just passed 500 million active.
So these are apps that are now at a pretty big scale and the immediate priority is going to be getting them to a billion people where they're continuing to focus on that before focusing on monetization and the way that we have with the core Facebook app, so that's kind of a second stage.
The third set are the new Facebook Creative Labs apps that we're just getting started. The things like Paper and a number of other things that we might announce that at some point. Those are even further along than even Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, where it will probably take few years for those to even to get to the stage that Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp are at, which by themselves are probably a few years away from being important businesses for us.
So that's kind of the pipeline of things that we see and there is kind of a full ecosystem of different ways the people want to share with different people.
In terms of ads going to your second question, I don't actually think we have a strategy that decrease ad impression. I think what you're seeing and what David mentioned is, we have newsfeed ads, which are higher quality and perform better and then we have this legacy of right hand column ads on desktop, which generally are just showing higher volume and they performed less well per ad unit.
So as we shift more towards newsfeed, what you're seeing is the total raw number of impressions as decreasing, but actually the amount of value that we're delivering is increasing.
So that might continue to shift as we continue to shift towards mobile, but I think overall what we're trying to do is make it that the individual load on a per person basis is isn’t increasing at a dramatic rate, but instead we're driving most of the wins in user experience, advertiser performance and our own revenue to increasing the quality primarily around newsfeed ads.
And we think that there is quite a lot to go there as Sheryl said. We want to get to a state where the ad content is as good as the organic content and we see we're getting pretty close in a few countries but we want to get to that everywhere.

Your next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question about engagement. By one measure, DAU over MAU, it's at an all-time high. But no doubt you always have a body of last users. I'm wondering if you could share any color on what types of algorithm or product tweaks that you've made have yielded the most return or the greatest return in terms of re-engaging last users.
And then, secondly, just quickly, any color you could provide on your estimate of the overlap of Instagram and Facebook users, perhaps based on the linking of those accounts. Thank you very much.
Mark Zuckerberg
Unfortunately, I don’t think I'm going to have much color on either of those. We are constantly doing things to make it so that people can share the content that they want, that they have the tools, that the new network showing them most relevant content to people.
That is always going to be the way that people will use the service not through some kind of trick or something that we're using to reengage people.
One stat that I think is pretty interesting is that, you would expect naturally that as our -- the community continues to grow and we're getting into later and later adapters, that the percent of people who are using Facebook or use it every day would decrease. And I have actually predicted for a long time, that eventually that would flatten out and I thought it would decrease but actually it continues to increase much to our surprise and joys.
And you know now this quarter I think, we're add almost 63% of people who use Facebook in a month will use it in a given day. And I think another stat, I think is actually quite interesting, is we tracked how many people use Facebook not just every day.
So I mean one day out of -- so what percent of our monthly folks use it today. But what percent of people used it six out of seven days of the week. And that number for the first time in the last quarter passed 50%.
So I mean that's pretty crazy if you think about is that, you have this really big engaged community and not only are almost 63% of people touching it in a given day and using the service because it's really engaging content, but we've gone to a period where more than 50% of people have used it six out of seven a week, almost every single day of a week.
That just speaks to I think - just the underlying kind of fundamental strength in the content and the work that we're doing just surface the best content of best people.

Your next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
First, David, let me add my congratulations on your success. And good luck with the future role. Mark, beyond games, do you see other categories of apps that are ramping?
And do you need to see that or can games continue to be the primary driver of app install and app engagement ads? And then, separately, on Graph Search, do you see the potential for more partnerships for Graph Search in terms of additional data sets and distributions partners? Or is this more go-it-along? And then, finally, maybe for Sheryl or David, can you just give us a sense on pricing trends on app install ads? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yes, I mean on app-installs, I actually think we see more diversity in the customers and developers on mobile now then we saw on desktop with Canvas. So Canvas the business was almost entirely games that is now -- we see that a lot of these games, but a lot of it is other kind of folks because I mean everyone who is building apps on mobile needs installs and we have the number one products out there for delivering that.
So, we see that happening and we feel pretty good about that.
Sheryl Sandberg
On pricing, we don't break our pricing by type of ad, but overall in the ecosystem, our prices are up as Mark said, the effective price per ad shown is driven up by more ads and newsfeed, and that's because newsfeed ads have significantly higher engagement and click-through rates.

Evan Wilson - Pacific Crest
Hi, thanks for the question. Just a small item. It looks like the Asia engagement metric, the MAU, was down sequentially, slightly. Was there something there that impacted that in Q1 or was there something competitive there you think might be impacting that part of the business, like the big mobile messaging services? Thanks.
David Ebersman
I don't know that I would read anything into that yet. We haven't identified that as a trend that we're focused on at this point. The number is $2 bucks around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter in various regions.

The next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura
Congratulations, David. And best of luck in your new endeavors, as well. One question for David and one for Sheryl. David, I just wondered if you could talk about your mix of impressions in terms of brand versus direct response. How has that changed this quarter versus prior quarters? And what else can be said about that split?
And then, secondly, for Sheryl, just wondered if you could give us a little more of an update on premium video ads. Specifically, I'm curious as to how those are sold. Are they sold on an impression basis or on a performance basis, or some hybrid of the two?
And then I know you don't give pricing by property, but is there a way to think about the premium or premium multiple of price that premium video ads would go for as compared to core News Feed ads? Thanks for any color on that.
David Ebersman
Thanks Anthony, I'm happy to take the first part of the question. I think in the first quarter we delivered strong performance across all the advertiser segments that we focus on. And so I think they are all growing nicely.
We don't have a perfect measure for what kind of demand is, brand versus DR per say, because someone doesn't have to input that into the system when they come in. We've lots of things we do to try and find surrogates for that and are happy to see using some of that data, we're seeing nice growth across the various segments.
Sheryl Sandberg
On video ads, video represents a really big opportunity, really driven by consumer behavior. Smartphones are going better and faster and more people have phones that can provide a great video experience. So we're seeing consumers do a lot more in video.
There's also a lot more video going through newsfeed that consumers are putting in and that creates an opportunity for us, both on the consumer side and the ad side.
We have our current product in the market, it's a click to play video ad, it's part of the page post, you can post the video.
Those are so both CPM and CPC and those are going really well and I think explains some of the growth we are seeing in our ads business.
We also have been in early conversations with some clients about what would be a CPM autoplay video ad and in terms of the expectations for that, we really want to see autoplay video ads be something that's pretty common in the newsfeed experience based on consumer usage before we push very hard in the ads business.
So we remain, long term very excited, we do expect that product, demand to premium product but as I said in my remarks, we won't see a material contribution from it this year.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
On those autoplay videos, as an average Facebook user, I've noticed them more and more in my News Feed, and I think they're really neat. I think all my friends love watching videos of my kids play basketball.
The question I'd have for you is what have you seen internally in terms of engagement. I assume that since I'm seeing more, other people are too, and that users like having them in. But is there any way you could quantify or maybe talk broadly about the impact that's having on usage? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
Our goal is to make newsfeed as engaging as possible and I think if you look at the engagement we have on mobile, we're getting 20% of mobile time on Facebook in the U.S. and growing globally as well. I think you see with that engagements grade, I'm sure your friends love seeing your kids play basketball. I think they probably like to see more of those.
And when and if we deliver a really great ad experience and ads that you love, something you're interested in, I think you're going to like that just as much, we look forward to the growth.

Your next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch
Great. I have a couple questions. On the app installs, can you help us at all understand what -- I know you gave us the number of total apps, but maybe how that revenue as a percentage of total, how important it is to you?
And then there's a lot of competitors targeting that market with new products. Maybe you could outline some of Facebook's competitive advantages in that market. And then one for Dave. We will miss you. Maybe you could talk a little bit about maybe some things Facebook could do to offset some of the dilution from the acquisitions, if anything. Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
On mobile app ads, we've seen really strong adoption and this is a very nascent but growing market. I think people sometimes think that a lot of our mobile ad revenue is coming from this one type of ad and our mobile ad revenue is very broad based.
We know you're seeing in newsfeed and what we see are ads from brand marketer's direct response, SMB's end developers and so we're pretty distributed there and pretty happy about that.
I think it's not surprising that other people are entering states, it's obviously growing, it's one that performs well. I think we continue to be excited by the results we're seeing for our marketers and developers.
The results we are seeing from consumers and we think the fact that we've already been investing and learning and growing, puts us in a great position to continue to have a very strong product offering even in a more competitive space.
David Ebersman
So, Justin on the -- the acquisition is the most important thing we'll do to truly I would say justify, the delusion will be to make those acquisitions successful and over time ensure that the unique assists that we're buying contribute to Facebook success and to our cash flows over time.
This business is obviously in really healthy shape right now in terms of the cash it's generating and we look forward at the moment to really continuing to prioritize where it's appropriate, investing that in the business to drive future growth.

Your next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Thank you very much. So firstly David, can you talk a little bit about the ad load during the quarter? We saw noticeable increases here in the holidays and through Q1 versus that 5% or 6% you mentioned back on the Q3 call. Is the new ad load we are seeing sustainable, do you think, going forward?
And, second, maybe Mark or Sheryl, can you just talk a little bit about timing for monetization of Instagram? Are there any thresholds, either in terms of users, user engagement, whatnot, before you can ramp that advertising, or advertise on that platform? I think, David, you were talking earlier about maybe reaching a billion, but I think that was a general comment. Thanks.
David Ebersman
Yeah, thanks Youssef. So as Mark sort of alluded to earlier as it relates to ad load, what we're trying to do is optimize across multiple variables that really produce the best experience for people who use the network and help us to grow the business.
And ad load is one of the variables that we look at. And of course we also look at things like the size of the ad, the prominence of the ads and of course the quality of the ads. And what we're trying to do is to continually really tweak all of those variables and then measure what impacts we're having on engagements, on feedback from people, on revenue and trying to optimize using that data and the changes that we've made.
And I think the story there is a really good one. Things continue to go very well obviously in terms of revenue what you see, but also in terms of engagement, in terms of feedback we get from people when we survey them. So we think we remain in a really very strong position in that way.
Actually we'd not validate the assertion that you gave that the ad load increased dramatically in the timeframe you described since that's not consistent in aggregate with our data.
What I can say is that, every person who uses Facebook has their own experience and the experience including the ad experience is personalized based on the other content we have available based on how much they've engaged with ads we've shown in the past etcetera.
So, ideally we'd like to personalize not just the organic content that you see, but also your ad experience in a way that's really optimized for you and your interests.
Sheryl Sandberg
On Instagram, Instagram is a great product. I think that's why we see so much engagement from people who are using it and the gross passing 200 million.
It's also a great advertising product and there's just tons of demand because you know, the picture themselves are so visually appealing and also there's so much consumer engagement.
We're in really early days, we've seen some great results, just to mention one, Levi's is running an ad, which is basically pictures of people wearing denim in really beautiful outdoor spaces.
They targeted people 18 to 34 in United States. Reached over seven million people and importantly they drove a 24%-- 24 point left in ad recall which was three times the control group.
So, I think that shows that just as people engage with consumer pictures on Instagram, they're going to engaged with the right pictures from marketers. That said, we're very focused on consumer growth and we move slowly and deliberately in monetization.
So, we don't see the need or the urge to ramp this as quickly as we possibly could but really want to grow it slowly, grow it deliberately and continue the growth on the consumer side and a great returns for marketers.

Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Colin Sebastian - Robert Baird
Thanks, I appreciate the chance to ask two questions. The first one is, I wonder if there's any way we can generalize or correlate around the growth in mobile monetization with the shift to 4G LTE, and whether this could be a driver, as well, of improving monetization internationally, as those higher-speed networks are deployed in new markets.
And then, secondly, regarding Nearby Friends, just wondering how you plan to tie that feature and data set into more of a commercialized local offering for businesses, whether that's geo targeting or other related services. Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg
Well, a lot of what we're trying to do with internet.org is making so that everyone has the cellular networks that they need to be able to get on the Internet and access basic services, which we think are text-based communication services, whether it's things like social networks or messaging or email or search, whether stock prices,-- like basic stuff like that, that people will use on a day-to-day basis, but don't require huge amount of data.
We're pretty happy with the early progress that we've made. We have a multi-year initiative to work with operators around the world to roll-out a program where folks can have free basic services. And as I mentioned before, a lot of the initial work is the initial partnerships were in the Philippines and Paraguay.
And what we're really pleased with, even just a few months of work, we were able to help almost three million people get access to data for the first time.
So, there is no doubt that going from having no access to data to having some access is a huge jump in terms of the activity on the business that we see -- that's available from people.
Moving towards things like LTE later on in the funnel, will be helpful as we move towards richer types of contents like higher resolution photos and videos.
so that will be important especially as the mix of content that people share moves towards the richer media. But we're really focused on both and we have a huge investment as well and the internet.org starting just making sure that everyone in the world gets connected.
Sheryl Sandberg
And Nearby Friends, it's a great new features, is an optional feature we just rolled out last week, I don't know if, people have had a chance to try it yet. But, rolling out slowly, but it’s a great product experience one we're excited to be able to offer.
We use the information like this to enhance all the services we provide, and make things more relevant including relevant ads.

Your next question comes from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.
Brian Wieser - Pivotal Research
Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First of all, I was wondering, with regard to the WhatsApp acquisition, I was wondering if you could update us on the status, if the current situation with Russia poses any issues given the development team space there. And then, separately, I was wondering if you could talk Nielsen and the use of OCR with respect to advertisers' interest in using OCR tools. Do you find that that's making a difference at the present time in terms of brands spending money with you, in general?
Sheryl Sandberg

On the first, yeah, the development team is located in Mountain View not in Russia. So…
Brian Wieser - Pivotal Research
And they are doing extremely well.
Sheryl Sandberg

Yes, they're doing really well.
Mark Zuckerberg
The deal has been closed. We don't have anything to share. But I just would just point you to a blog post that Jan wrote. I think it was yesterday announcing that they just help to connect 0.5 billion monthly asset. We're growing very quickly. So I think that's up to about 460 million monthly is just a couple of months ago when we announced the deal was done in the first place.
David Ebersman
And I think that Jan specifically called out a few countries including Russia and Brazil and I think India is some of the fastest growing markets for WhatsApp. So I'd just direct you that statement and you should read that for more information on how they're doing and we'll update you more when the deal closes.
Sheryl Sandberg
And Nielsen OCR anything that helps advertisers measure their spend is really important. I've talked on the call a bunch about how measuring online and in-store sales really matters. It also matters to marketers to be able to measure their spend compared to other investments they can make.
And what OCR has done, it's given advertisers and marketers comparability between TV and digital and our spend. I think in those comparisons we do very well. And I think that is part of the shift that’s happening and its part of why we see growing interest from clients.

Your next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ross Sandler, your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Good afternoon. Can you guys hear me now? Okay, Just two quick questions. Facebook's on pace to represent around 20% of global display advertising or non search advertising in 2014. Do you view that as your addressable market?
And, if so, what do you see as the potential market share you guys can capture relative to the -- I think, Sheryl, you said it is 23% mobile consumption, ex-China, globally today. And then the second question is, there's been some press recently that Facebook is looking at building peer-to-peer money transfer services. Is that a market that you view as an opportunity? Would that fit into Messenger or potentially a standalone app?
Sheryl Sandberg
We had our payments business for a while and we continue to have one and nothing new to apps there.
On the first question, I think our adjustable market is much bigger than digital and you see that in the trends. The big trend that’s happening is the shift from consumer time. So last year was the very first time those lines crossed and consumers spent more time in digital, which is mobile and desktop than they did on TV.
That continues to grow, so where we are right now is, the average U.S. consumer as an example spent 4.5 hours per day on TV but five and three quarter on digital and that’s largely been driven by mobile.
That means that as consumer time and attention shifts, we think ad budget shift as well particularly if you have good mobile ad products and you can measure results.
So we definitely believe there will be and continuous to be a shift happening. I talked about a print shift happening with that example of Sport Chek in Canada. But we see this across the board that marketers are looking for the highest ROI they can find and they should be comparing us and everyone else across and they do that not just across digital but across print, across radio, across TV, across any other vehicle they can.
I think our investments and measurement really pay-off here. We say to our clients all around the world, we want to earn your business because we want to be the best dollar and the best minute you send because both their dollars and their time are so valuable.
And we want them to compare us to the other investments that could make to see who can drive the most value to the bottom line and that's what we are focused on and that goes way beyond digital.
Deborah Crawford

I think we have time for one last question.

Your next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company

Great. Thanks for the questions. Just wondered if you could discuss how Facebook's potential mobile ad network would provide additional value to advertisers than other existing mobile ad networks.
And then just a second question for David. I don't know if you could help quantify what meaningfully lower year-over-year ad revenue growth is, or just give us a sense of how to think about it for modeling purposes. Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
On the ad network, we are in very testing for mobile ad network. We do see a big opportunity here. We think because we're people based, we have an opportunity first to provide greater reach for marketers and developers who are working with Facebook across other platforms, but also improve the relevance of the ads people see both on and off Facebook.
And I think that has been our core advantage and will continue to be. That said, it's really early days and we're on the early testing phase.
David Ebersman
Yes John, obviously the Q1 ad revenues growth here was 82% which is fantastic and a real tribute to the team and the platform. One of the things that contributed to that growth rate is the ramp up of newsfeed ads that in Q1 of last year was still really early in that part of the journey and so the comparison between the state of newsfeed ads in the Q1 we're reporting now in a year ago is meaningfully different.
As you'll remember from last year, newsfeed ad really ramped up in the second quarter and revenue growth ramped up as well. So that’s just going to impact the comparisons in the subsequent quarters of the year.
Having said that, there is lots of things that we're focused on, that will continue to drive our ad revenue growth including more users and critically more marketer demand. So bringing more marketers into the system, improving our products and tools to increase their returns and their ability to measure those returns and generally improving the quality and relevance and value of the ad.
So those are the things that we'll stay focused on.
Deborah Crawford
Great. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again.

Good afternoon. [Operator instructions.] Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook's director of investor relations, you may begin.
Deborah Crawford
Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Facebook's fourth quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and David Ebersman, CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. 
Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's press release, our annual report on Form 10-K, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.
And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. This was a great quarter and a great way to end the year. We saw strong growth in engagement around the world, and we’re very pleased with the growth of our ad business, especially on mobile.
Overall, 2013 was an important year for us. If 2012 was the year we turned our core product into a mobile product, then 2013 was the year when we turned our business into a mobile business. I expect 2014 will be the year when we begin to deliver new and engaging types of mobile experiences.
As of the end of the year, more than 1.23 billion people now use Facebook each month. Last quarter was our first quarter where more than 50% of our ad revenue came from mobile. Looking back at the year, we launched an important products and initiatives: internet.org, graph search, Instagram video, and Messenger 3.0. We also made a lot of improvements to the performance and reliability of all our mobile apps. 
One important trend from the last year is the continued growth in size and engagement of our community. In 2013, we added 172 million monthly actives and 139 million daily actives. That means that our daily engagement continues to increase. In the latest quarter, more than 60% of our monthly actives visited Facebook daily. 
Given the size of our community, we’re very excited about this pace of growth. We’re also seeing people engaging more. On the average day in December, we saw more than 6 billion likes. That’s up 59% from 3.8 billion likes a year ago.
These trends show that our strategy of improving the quality of our core experiences over the last year has paid off, and we’re now in a good position to focus on our longer term goals of connecting everyone, understanding the world, and building the knowledge economy.
Connecting everyone is about bringing the internet to everyone and giving them the tools to stay connected with the people and things that matter to them. Today, more than 750 million people use Facebook every day. While that makes up by far the largest social network in the world, we’re still a small part of the world’s population.
Only one-third of the world’s population has access to the internet today, and for even many of those, the return on experience remains pretty weak. Helping more people get connected is important the developing the global knowledge economy. Once people are connected, they can access tools like basic financial services, health information, and education tools to help them take care of their families and join the worldwide economy.
That’s why last summer we launched internet.org, a partnership with industry leaders to make affordable internet access available to everyone in the world. In 2014, we’re going to focus on achieving internet.org’s mission by deepening the relationships with mobile operators around the world and working to develop new models for internet access.
Our existing partnerships with operators are something we’ve already invested a lot in over the years, and this is an area where we’re really excited to build on going forward. Connecting everyone ultimately means giving people the power to share different kinds of content with different groups of people.
This is something we’ve focused on by building separate mobile apps beyond the main Facebook app. Messenger and Instagram are examples of this. We launched a new version of Messenger to make the app even faster for mobile to mobile communications. Messenger was among the topmost downloaded apps on iOS and Android in December, and we’ve seen meaningful growth in engagement since launching.
The number of people using Messenger grew more than 70% in the past three months, and we’ve seen a large increase in the number of messages sent. We have a lot more coming to messenger in the first half of this year, and I’m excited to build on these early results.
Instagram also had a busy quarter, bringing Instagram to Windows Phone, launching our first ads, and launching Instagram Direct, the new way to send private photo and video messages. 
We’re pleased with the early reaction to all these products. With ads, the team has taken an especially careful approach, working closely with a small number of brands that are already important members of the Instagram community to create a great early experience.
I’m also excited to report that there are now more than 500 million people using Facebook Groups every month. Groups is one of our core products, and it provides a private space for sharing with small groups like your family, close friends, or a sports team, or for larger communities, like schools or even companies.
One theme that should be clear from our work on products like Messenger, Groups, and Instagram is that our vision for Facebook is to create a set of products that help you share any kind of content you want within the audience you want. 
We’re not just focused on improving the experience of sharing with all of your friends at once, although that’s growing quickly too. A lot of the new growth we see is coming from giving people the tools to share with different sized groups of people.
Now, moving on to our business, last quarter I talked about our efforts to grow our business through improving the quality of our ads rather than just increasing the quantity. Our goal is to reach a point where the ads are as relevant and timely as the content your friends share with you.
To do this, we’ve put a lot of effort into measuring people’s sentiment around our ads and seeing how people engage with them. We do some of the broadest surveys in the world. We survey more than 35,000 people every day to see how we’re doing, and we use the results to drive our product development.
Our approach is working. In the second half of 2013, we saw an improvement in sentiment about ads on mobile, even as volume grew during that period. We also saw sentiment on desktop remain stable. Interestingly, even as the volume of newsfeed ads has grown, clickthrough rates have also remained stable.
We’re very pleased with these results, and they suggest our strategy of improving quality is working. Our plan is to continue focusing on improving quality, since we think this is the best way for us to improve the experience for people on Facebook, returns for advertisers, and our own revenue, as well as achieving our long term goal of providing ads that are as relevant as organic content. 
So that’s my update on where we’re focusing our efforts in the context of our longer-term goals. It’s been a strong quarter and a great year for Facebook. Next week, Facebook turns 10 years old. It’s been an amazing journey so far, for me personally and for all of us at the company. 
But what’s ahead of us is even more exciting. Many of the successes of the past 10 years have simply been steps on the path to achieving our long term vision of connecting everyone and improving the world through sharing. Over the coming months and years, you’ll see us continue focusing on many of the same themes, but now with greater scale, ambition, and resources.
Finally, I just want to thank everyone who works at Facebook for a great year in 2013 and over the past 10 years. What we’ve achieved together has been a result of all your hard work, and I’m grateful that so many talented people are a part of our team. Thank you, and now here’s Sheryl. 
Sheryl Sandberg
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. I am really excited to report earnings this quarter, and proud of the teams at Facebook who delivered these results.
We ended 2013 with a terrific quarter, continuing the strong momentum we saw throughout the year. Our total revenue grew 63% year over year, led by 76% growth in advertising revenue. Approximately 53% of our ad revenue came from mobile.
This is not only the first time we crossed the 50% threshold in mobile, but it’s also our first billion dollar mobile quarter. In fact, our Q4 mobile ad revenue of $1.25 billion was nearly as large as our total ad revenue in Q4 of last year.
This growth continues to be very broad-based. The combination Mark spoke about of our growth in users and engagement and the effectiveness of our ads in newsfeed work together to provide marketers with a powerful way to reach people. This impact is evident in our results. This quarter, we saw healthy increases in every region around the world and positive momentum in all four marketer segments. 
There are three key drivers propelling our business. First and foremost is strong mobile engagement. Every day, more people around the world are spending more time on their mobile devices, and marketers are starting to shift their budgets to reach them.
This was especially clear during the holiday season, where not surprisingly, Black Friday was our single biggest mobile ad revenue day in the quarter. When people are shopping in stores, they’re on their phones, and when they’re on their phones, they’re on Facebook.
A recent study by Millward Brown Digital showed that while shopping in store, people who use Facebook do so at four times the rate of any other app or search. And for those people that use Facebook as a source before shopping, over half stated that it was a very influential source of information for them while they were shopping in the store.
The second driver of our ad business is a continued growth in the number of marketers using Facebook. Again, this growth is broad-based and diverse, across marketers, verticals, and geographies. I’ll update you briefly on each of our four marketer segments.
Demand from direct response marketers was strong in the Q4 holiday shopping periods, particularly in ecommerce. These marketers focus on short term ROI, so the growth we’re seeing speaks to our ability to efficiently drive sales for them.
For example, online retailer NoMoreRack used Facebook to promote its holiday deals. They hit their aggressive ROI targets and they generated $8 million dollars in revenue on Black Friday alone.
We’re also making remarkable progress with SMBs, a segment that many in the industry have long considered the Holy Grail of online advertising, and a segment that I’ve been particularly focused on throughout my career.
In November, we reported that more than 25 million SMBs maintain an active page on Facebook. We’ve made a big investment in simplifying our ad products over the last year, and that investment is working to convert these SMBs into advertisers. Of the new SMB advertisers we acquired in Q4,72% started with our most simple ad product. 
For developers, mobile apps are generating very healthy revenue growth. We launched mobile app [install] ads just over a year ago, and mobile app engagement ads last quarter, based on a very simple idea, that we can help people find and use great apps.
This is working even better than we hoped. We’re helping developers attract new customers and keep them engaged. We remain excited about the opportunities in this small but quickly growing category. In addition, last week we announced a small test to show Facebook ads in third-party mobile apps. We won’t have meaningful results for a while, but it’s an interesting area for us to explore.
And finally, we’re making steady progress with our brand marketers, particularly in verticals like CPG. We’re helping them connect with customers in more dynamic ways, starting a small test of our new video ad product, and measuring our impact on their sales, which is super important to driving their business.
The third driver for both the quarter and the full year has been our investment in product development. We’re especially pleased with the improvements we’ve made to our targeting capabilities and measurement tools. Our goal, as Mark said, is to make our ads as useful as possible for consumers and to generate greater returns for marketers, eventually making all of our ads as valuable to users as our organic content.
Custom audiences is our most important product in this effort. When we launched it over a year ago, it allowed marketers to reach their current customers on Facebook. Since then, we’ve built more targeting capabilities while maintaining user privacy. 
These include lookalike targeting that lets marketers reach people who are similar to their best customers and partner categories which use third-party data to improve our targeting. Now marketers can reach exactly the people they’re looking for, such as people who buy fashion apparel or are in the market for a new car.
We’ve more than doubled the number of partner categories in the U.S., and now offer more than 1,000. And we believe there’s still significant opportunity ahead, as we continue to improve our targeting capabilities.
We’re also making major investments in measurement so that we can measure the impact of our advertising on in-store sales. In December, we launched offline conversion measurement. To date, our results show that the average return on ad spend for newsfeed campaigns is 8x, a result that is really impressive when compared to other returns marketers have available.
As Mark noted, this is the beginning of a new year, and our 10th anniversary, so I want to reflect really briefly on where our advertising business and we believe the marketing industry is headed. Before mass media, all business was personal. Sales happened customer by customer at the local store or door to door. The evolution of mass media made it possible to sell at scale, but business was no longer personal.
On Facebook, marketers can do both. We’re building the world’s first global platform that lets marketers personalize their messages at unprecedented scale. This is marketing where you are for who you are.
This shift to personalization represents the biggest shift in marketing in generations, and it’s one that we are uniquely positioned to lead. Facebook is the only place where 750 million people visit every day, increasingly on mobile, to discover what matters to them. As we continue to leverage our understanding of people to make marketing more personal, and do it at massive scale, we will dramatically improve the quality of ads and drive more personal discovery.
Facebook is making business personal again, and like Mark, I want to thank the teams that we get to work with every day at Facebook for doing a great job to make this happen. Now I’d like to turn it over to David. 
David Ebersman 
Thanks, Sheryl. Overall, 2013 was a great year for Facebook. We performed well against all our key financial priorities, growing revenue to $7.9 billion, delivering operating profit and free cash flow each of over $2.8 billion, and making investments that position the company for continued growth.
Today’s results strengthen our conviction that we’re in the early days of capitalizing on a significant opportunity. Let’s start with some user and engagement highlights. During the year, the population of people using Facebook on a daily basis increased by 139 million to 757 million, and the population of people using Facebook each month grew by 172 million to 1.23 billion. In December, 62% of our monthly users used Facebook on an average day. 
Mobile continues to drive our growth. When we began 2013, we had more daily users on desktop than mobile. By the end of this year, our daily users on mobile outnumbered desktop by around 200 million.
We’re also pleased that engagement per user continued to increase in 2013, based on measures such as time spent per user and feedback per user. And none of these stats include Instagram, which doubled its user base over the past year. The network of people who use our products remains the foundation for everything we do, and they’re the most important audience we’re trying to serve and delight every day. 
Turning now to the financials, in Q4, total revenue was $2.95 billion, up 63%, and ad revenue was $2.34 billion, up 76%, for our highest year over year growth rate since mid-2011. Exchange rates had no meaningful impact. We continue to experience strong revenue growth around the world. Ad revenue in each of our four recorded geographic regions grew by more than 65% in Q4 compared to last year. 
The key driver of ad revenue growth continued to be the strong performance of newsfeed ads on mobile and desktop, which helped us attract more advertiser demand. Mobile ad revenue increased from approximately $881 million in Q3 to approximately $1.25 billion in Q4, a healthy increase that of course benefited from seasonal effects.
In Q4, total ad impressions declined 8%, and the average effective price per ad was up 92% compared to last year. The decline in ad impressions was primarily due to the shift in usage towards mobile devices, where people are shown fewer ads compared to desktop, since there’s no right hand column ads on mobile.
The significant increase in average price per ad was driven by the mix shift to more newsfeed ads that have much higher engagement and clickthrough rates, increasing the average effective price per ad impression. The price volume trends were pretty similar across our four geographies.
Total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 was $241 million, down 6% versus last year, remembering that in Q4 last year we recognized revenue from four months of payments transactions. 
On a more apples-to-apples basis, payments revenue from games, which represents the substantial majority of our payments and other fees revenue, grew approximately 8% in Q4 versus last year, despite the fact that our payments revenue from games is limited to our desktop users, a population that’s declining. 
Turning now to expenses, our Q4 GAAP expenses were $1.45 billion, up 37%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.13 billion, up 33%. For the full year, our non-GAAP expenses were up 44%, driven largely by growth in infrastructure expense and a 37% increase in headcount over the year.
As our revenue has grown, we’ve worked hard to stay disciplined in terms of our expense growth, focusing on investments where we’re most confident of creating value and meaningful ROI. We’re pleased with the returns we achieved from many of our investments that we made in 2013, including those to advance our ad products, improve mobile product quality, increase engagement, and drive efficiency improvements in our infrastructure.
Our Q4 GAAP operating income was $1.13 billion, representing a 44% operating margin, and our non-GAAP operating income was $1.46 billion, representing a 56% margin, up from 46% last year. As you know, margins are typically the strongest in the fourth quarter, given the seasonal strength in our advertising business. 
Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for Q4 were 54% and 46% respectively, and for the full year 2013, our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 46% and 41%. The tax rates in Q4 were higher than the rates for prior quarters of the year, primarily because of intercompany payments that occurred in Q4 related to our international operations. Also, at the end of 2013, we had a tax net operating loss, or NOL, carryforward of almost $8 billion. 
In Q4, GAAP net income was $523 million, or $0.20 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $780 million, or $0.31 per share, up approximately 80% compared to last year. Capex was $483 million in Q4, and $1.37 billion for the full year. 
Our efficiency investments, including the Open Compute project on the hardware side and proprietary work on the software side, have enabled us to significantly increase the amount of data and the number of users we can support with each server we buy, and these investments have saved us over $1 billion over the past three years. We wouldn’t be able to deliver the profit and cash flow numbers we’re reporting today without the success of these efficiency investments.
Our Q4 free cash flow was $748 million, and our full year free cash flow was $2.8 billion, including the benefit from a $419 million tax refund in Q2. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with $11.4 billion in cash and investments. This number includes $1.5 billion from our secondary offering of 27 million shares in December at the time of our inclusion in the S&P 500 index.
Now I want to share a few thoughts on 2014. In terms of expenses, we’re planning that our total 2014 GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue and including stock comp, will likely grow in the neighborhood of 35% to 40%, and non-GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock comp, will likely grow in the neighborhood of 40% to 45%.
We plan to invest with a continued emphasis on technical headcount and product development to take advantage of the opportunities we see to create new experiences and more value for our users, marketers, and developers.
On taxes, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in 2014 to be roughly similar to our full year tax rates in 2013, although this could vary widely depending upon acquisitions, our international revenue and expense mix, and other factors.
Our tax rate in 2014 and over the next several years will continue to reflect the fact that we’re in the early years of investing in our international operations. Longer term, we expect our tax rate to be in line with peer companies who have similar operations and international revenue mixes.
We ended 2013 with 2.6 billion diluted shares outstanding, including the December stock offering, and we estimate that our diluted share count will increase roughly 2% to 2.5% by the end of 2014, although this may vary depending upon our stock price and new share issuances, for example to support M&A.
We anticipate our 2014 capex will increase to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. The significant year over year growth will be driven by an expansion of our Menlo Park headquarters, infrastructure-related expenses such as the buildout of our Iowa data center, and by our investment plans to support initiatives like internet.org that are designed to increase internet penetration in the developing world. We’ll also continue to make strategic investments to improve capital efficiency. 
Last, in terms of revenue, in 2014 we hope to build on our success from last year. 2013 strong growth in ads revenue was driven by the rapid ramp up of newsfeed ads, growth in users, engagement, and marketers using Facebook, and by the product investments we made that improve the quality relevance, and performance of our ads.
As Sheryl described, we believe we’re still early in the evolution of our advertising business and the mobile ad business in general. This makes for a difficult time to forecast near term revenues with any precision, but it also makes for an exciting time, and we’re looking forward to capitalizing on this opportunity.
To sum up, Q4 was a strong end to a great year for Facebook. Thanks for joining us on the call today, and now let’s open for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. 
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
Sheryl, I was wondering if you could rank order the four groups of marketers and discuss how SMBs play out over time versus the larger enterprise companies. And then Mark, if you could talk more, expand more, on what you mean by standalone mobile apps, and really what your vision is there. And I understand you’re speaking at Mobile World Congress, so any update on what we should expect on that?
Sheryl Sandberg 
We don’t break out by segment, but all four segments are growing, and we’re pleased with the growth there. I’m glad you asked about SMBs, because it’s a particular focus for us, and somewhere I’m really proud of our performance. Our teams, led by Dan Levy and others, have just done a great job.
There are 25 million SMBs that have pages on Facebook, and that’s a really great first step, because just historically, it’s very hard to get small businesses online. What we’ve done over the last year is we’ve really worked at simplifying our ad product. 
And that’s working, because the way to convert our SMBs who are using our free product into being advertisers are with these really simple ad products. So rather than going to them and saying, do you want to become an advertiser, you say, do you want to promote a post. And that’s what’s working, and we’re able to convert them to advertising, and then upsell them from there in large numbers. And we’re excited about it. 
Mark Zuckerberg 
And in terms of the focus on building new and separate experiences, our theory is that there are all these different ways that people want to share and communicate. Almost any kind of content that you can imagine sharing: text, photos, videos, links, locations, events, games, any type of content, with any type of audience. You know, whether it’s privately in a one-on-one situation, or small groups, or with all of your friends, or a larger community, or publicly. 
There’s an interesting intersection between most of these things, and one of the things that we want to try to do over the next few years is build a handful of great new experiences that are separate from what you think of as Facebook today that are just kind of helping to explore that space and give people new ways to share. 
I think you can see that that’s something that people want, from some of the mobile apps that exist out there today. You can see it from our own offering, with not just Facebook but also Instagram and messenger already today. And we’re going to keep on working on this over the next few years.

The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs 
I have two questions. The first one, there’s been a lot of talk about Messenger over the last couple of quarters. I’m just wondering if you could share with us how you see the competitive environment for Facebook in the area of messaging, in particular in regions like Asia. And how do you see Facebook differentiating itself and maybe changing the user behavior from some of the newer companies that have aggregated a large number of users in the space?
And then my second question is just for David in regard to seasonality of ad revenue. And obviously it typically declines in Q1. I’m just wondering if we’re at the point now where we should see seasonality of mobile ad revenue in Q1.
Mark Zuckerberg 
I can talk to Messenger a bit. If you think about the overall space of sharing and communication, there’s not just one thing that people are doing. People want to have the ability to share any kind of content with any audience. There are going to be a lot of different apps that exist, and Facebook has always had the mission of helping people share any kind of content with any audience, but historically we’ve done that through a single app. 
And one of the stats that I shared today is that we now have more than half a billion people using Groups every month. And that’s not something that I think a lot of people are paying attention to, because it was sort of seen as a feature of the Facebook app rather than its own product.
So what we’re doing with Messenger now, similarly, a lot of people are using Messenger every day, but it’s like a feature of Facebook rather than its own network or standalone thing. And we’re making it more of a standalone app, and we’ve actually, in the latest quarter, we’ve taken it out of the main app, so that way it gets room to breathe and blossom as its own great experience. And we’re going to focus on making that really good and adding a lot of new things. 
I mean, some of the stats that I shared are incredibly promising. In the last few months, 70% more people are using it, and a lot of message volume growth. So we’re still focused on kind of general growth for Messenger rather than going country-specific at this point in its evolution. 
David Ebersman 
Thanks for your question on seasonality. Of course seasonality is an important factor in an advertising business, and affects Q4 and makes it a typically strong quarter. At this point, given how new we are with the mobile business, I think it’s really difficult for us to quantify the impact of seasonality. I think it will take some more time before we can understand it better than we do.

The next question comes from Mark May with Citibank. 
Mark May - Citibank
Just would love to get some updates on some of the efforts that you’re making in terms of brand and real time conversation. I think on the user side, would love to get some interest in terms of the usage and engagement with video content early on, and real time conversations, particularly around entertainment related content. And then on the advertiser side, kind of early adoption by brand and TV-like advertisers with some of the brand and video solutions that you have out there.
And then for David, given the significant transition that the business continues to go through that is affecting these ad impression and average price metrics, can you give us a sense of the breakdown between the ad impressions between desktop and mobile?
Mark Zuckerberg 
I’ll start here on the public content piece, and then I think Sheryl will get into some of the specifics. But I just want to put this in the context of the overall strategy here. We were just talking about some of the standalone experiences and Messenger, and public content is part of this overall spectrum of content that people want to share and consume as well. In some ways, it’s the complete opposite side of the spectrum from one-on-one messaging, but it’s also an area where I think the medium of newsfeed and Facebook works really well.
So we’ve been focused on improving the tools for public discussion and folks to be able to share public content, including premium content like videos and making it so that they can autoplay in feed. And this is an area where, just like Messaging and some of the other things we’ve talked about, you should expect us to keep focusing on a lot. It’s part of the overall space of sharing that we think is quite valuable. I think Sheryl is going to get into some of the specifics.
Sheryl Sandberg 
Yeah, I can start with video and then go to the overall brand question you started with. We have a current video ads product that works very well. It’s part of what’s driving our growth. We have also recently started testing an autoplay video ad. That’s just a very small test. But overall, we’re seeing what Mark has talked about, which is that marketers and users are using video more, as they have the technology to do so. And we expect that to continue to grow.
In our overall brand effort, we’re making really good and steady progress as we are with all of our market segments. All of the Ad Age Global 100 advertised with us over the past year. And the real key there is proving measurement to our clients. Our team, led by Carolyn Everson and her people all around the world, really have to go client by client and show them that we can not just increase people’s happiness or brand affiliation, but ring the cash register at the end of the day.
I think this is part of the big story for us in 2013, which is if you look back a year, we didn’t have that ability to look at the [AB] test of who saw our ads, and what the different in sales is. And now we have that. And we still have a lot of hard work to do, client by client, ahead of us, but being able to prove that we have really strong ROI, and I think increasingly efficient ROI, compared to the other marketing opportunities they have, is what is going to move the brand marketers to Facebook and to mobile.
David Ebersman 
Your second question about mobile and desktop impressions, as you know, per user or per unit of time on the desktop, we show a higher number of ads, because there’s the right hand column ads in addition to newsfeed. But we’re extremely pleased with how well the newsfeed ads continue to performance, and that’s really what’s driving up the average price per ad, as I described. So these ads perform well for marketers and are still continuing to contribute to the positive user experience that Mark described earlier.

The next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. 
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura
First, for David, I wonder if you could comment on the ad load on Facebook. Do you expect that to continue to remain stable, or is there a possibility that the ad load creeps up over time? 
And on Instagram, I know it’s a new product, and you guys are taking it slowly at first, but I wonder if you could also talk about how long it might take for Instagram to get to a similar ad load to Facebook’s levels. 
And then one last question for Sheryl, I wonder is there a way, when you compare Facebook to television for brand marketers, to look at the disparity of ROI, or I should say the improved ROI for Facebook, and sort of extrapolate where you think pricing could go. Obviously pricing doubling quite a bit. How much more upside to Facebook newsfeed pricing can we expect to see based on the ROI differential? 
Mark Zuckerberg 
I just want to start off here, and then David can get into some of the details on the number of ads and all that. But you know, the strategy has been, for the last period, and will continue to be, to primarily focus on increasing the quality of the ads and the experience.
And I really think that it’s easy to look at the model and say, okay, if we ran more ads then the business would grow faster in the short term, but investing in quality is really actually the most important thing, because it’s what improves the experience for the people who use the product. It drives greater returns for advertisers, and over time it increases the potential size of our business.
And I think you can say that that’s a harder path for us to take, but I actually think that the results over the last couple of quarters have really shown that by focusing on improving quality instead of just increasing quantity, we can actually drive pretty incredible business results. So we think that there’s more to do here, and that’s what we’re going to keep on doing. 
David Ebersman 
I think I can take most of the rest of this. In terms of ad load, the one piece of context maybe to start with is the variable we’re really focused on optimizing isn’t ad load per se, but it’s the user experience, as you can measure that based on engagement or user feedback, etc. And ad load is one of the variables that impacts that, but there’s other relevant variables as well, such as the positioning of the ads, the size of the ads, and of course critically the quality of the ads. So ad load only gives a part of the picture. 
And we’re really one or two years into this, and we’re still learning how to provide the best experience. I think one of the most important pieces of positive news from 2013 was as we ramped up newsfeed ads, they performed as well as they did, delivering great value for marketers, having a very minimal effect on the user experience, and enabling Facebook to deliver the kind of results that we reported today. 
So going forward, we’ll continue to tweak what we do in terms of trying to find the right balance and optimize the performance of the ads for marketers and for users, but generally, as Mark said, the most important place for us to invest is going to be in improving the quality and relevance of the ads.
You asked about Instagram and pricing, so let me just cover those quickly. Instagram I would say we’re just really early with Instagram. So it’s too early to talk about where we’re going to be going. We’re still trying to learn what the right way to approach that product is, and we’re going to move slowly, because we think that’s the right thing to do for Instagram
In terms of pricing, it was our expectation that if ads in newsfeed worked well, that they would deliver more value for marketers, be more engaging, and that they would contribute to the average price per ad on Facebook going up. And we also believe, looking forward, if we continue to improve the quality and relevance of the ads we show, that that’s a critical way that we can drive pricing up in the future.

The next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan 
Just wanted to ask two things. First, you announced an initiative or perhaps an algorithm tweak, I think, in early December to have more news stories in users’ feeds. And I was just curious what the adoption has been thus far from users there, and what are the implications on usage and engagement, and then also ad load. And then secondly, can you give us an update on teen engagement trends?
Mark Zuckerberg 
To start with the public content, the change that we made is basically a lot of what our algorithm looks at is straight engagement. So the amount of content that people click, like, comment, and share in feed. But what we found was that when we asked people qualitatively what they prefer getting, it didn’t often match up, because a lot of things like memes scored very high in terms of getting a lot of people to like them, but weren’t necessarily, when you asked people, what they wanted to see in feed, or what they were happy seeing, didn’t score that way.
So we ended up doing an adjustment to the algorithm, which made it so that qualitatively things and especially public content and news that people rated as higher quality qualitatively scored more, and that was basically the adjustment to the algorithm. It had really no impact on ads. It was an organic content adjustment that we made to improve the quality of the experience. So I think David can talk about teens.
David Ebersman 
In terms of teens, we don’t have any new data to report today. As you know, we take engagement very seriously, and we’re focused on building great products that all our users, including teens, will find useful and engaging. And that’s the most important thing for us to stay focused on. 
Operator
The next question comes from Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley 
I had a couple of product questions for Mark. The first one on Graph Search, just wondering how users are engaging with the product, how it developed, what the product is, in terms of what we can see today relative to what your longer term aspirations are for the product. 
And then just a follow up on Doug’s question, related to the news flow integration into newsfeed. You know, another feature that’s been added more recently is trending and attaching trending to news articles in newsfeed as well. So if you could talk more broadly about your interest in real time information and news as it relates to public content, that would be helpful.
Mark Zuckerberg 
Starting with Graph Search, we’re really early in the game on this, and I think you can see that because we haven’t even really rolled out our mobile version of Graph Search yet, and we’re a mobile company, and we started on desktop. The way that we’re thinking about this, there’s just so much content that people have shared on Facebook that simply building the infrastructure to index all of it and start ranking it is a multiyear effort, which we’re making our way through. 
So the first release indexed more than a trillion connections between all the people and interests and events and groups and things that everyone was connected to. The second release that we did recently was around all the updates. So there are more than a trillion status updates and unstructured text posts and photos and pieces of content that people have shared over the past 10 years, and indexing that was a really big deal, because as the number of people on the team who have worked on web search engines in the past have told me, a trillion pieces of content is more than the index in any web search engine.
So we’re kind of making our way through this. Pretty soon, I think you should expect us to roll out the mobile version of this. I think that’s going to be an important step, because most of the usage in Facebook overall is on mobile, so we expect that that’s where engagement will really start to come from on Graph Search over time.
But it’s also only in English so far, and we have to internationalize it. So there’s a long roadmap of things that we need to do that I think is pretty clear, but it’s just going to be incredibly useful when it’s ready. We look at this as an investment over a three to five year period rather than a one to two or shorter period. So that’s how I think about that.
The other question was about trending topics, and that really ties into the public content push that we have. And we talked a bit about this before. We’re trying to build great experiences for all types of content that people want to share and consume with all audiences. 
We think public content is great. Folks who are making news, or premium content on TV, or movies, or celebrities and different types of folks are extremely interesting and produce great content, and we want to be a great place for people to share that content, and for people to be able to learn about it and consume it. So trending topics is one step in what you will see as a pretty long roadmap of things that we’re going to do to make Facebook great for public content.

The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. 
Eric Sheridan - UBS
First one for Sheryl. I would love to get an update on how the company’s thinking about mobile retargeting ads. You’ve seen a lot of success with retargeting on desktop, but how you can think about the evolution of retargeting in the mobile environment as a future product. And I guess second question for Mark, not a lot of talk on the payments business so far in the call, and just wanting to understand, maybe an update around games or other areas of ecommerce that you think are opportunities for the payments business.
Sheryl Sandberg 
On retargeting, retargeting has been proven really valuable across all platforms. We’ve allowed it through [FBX], and increasingly we’re allowing it through our own products as well. As part of our custom audiences suite of offerings, we’re offering website custom audiences and mobile app custom audiences. And these all allow marketers to target ads in privacy safe ways that improve the relevance and improve results.
I think when people think about targeting, what they’re really thinking about is relevance, and taking the data and using it in a privacy safe way to increase the relevance of ads to users. And that’s something we’re working on.
Mark Zuckerberg 
For payments, we don’t think about our business so much as an advertising or payments business as we’ve built this network and we help businesses reach people with relevant messages. And payments historically has been a great way for game developers, especially on desktop, an efficient way for us to monetize that business, because instead of charging them up front for most of the ads, we can charge them only when their business grows because someone is paying for something.
On mobile, I think the natural evolution of this is for that to move toward app install ads, where we’re not running the payment system on mobile. The operating systems are integrated with that. But because a lot of the goods that people are buying in games are no marginal cost, a developer’s economic incentive is to advertise to get more people to come into their flow for as many people as they can get to buy the goods.
So even though a game developer might be paying 30% to the operating system maker for payments, we’re finding that people also really want to buy a lot of app install ads, and that’s grown incredibly quickly, and is one of the best parts of the ad work that we did over the last year.
Operator
The next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. 
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company
Two questions. First, Mark, you referenced 2014 as a year of rolling out new and engaging mobile products. Maybe could you provide some color or highlight the types of products that users can expect, or maybe how you think about improving mobile engagement? And then just on Instagram, can you give us an update on the number of monthly active users ending 2013 and give us a sense of how the data testing is going with advertisers, and when it might be available for all advertisers?
Mark Zuckerberg 
Before I get into some of the newer types of things, which we’ve actually touched on most of them already on the call, I also want to take a moment just to emphasize that we’re going to start building new experiences, but they’re going to start small compared to where the core of Facebook is. 
So most of the results that we’re going to see in terms of the increase in engagement and sharing and our business are going to come from the core Facebook experience, because mathematically, it’s just so much bigger than everything else that is out there that the numbers, you’d have to be multiyear investments to add up to that. 
I mean, you can look at, for example, comScore puts out these numbers every month or so that reference the amount of time that people spend in different mobile apps. Facebook I think is almost 5-10 times bigger than the next app that is out there. So it’s going to take a while for any of these things to turn into huge things. 
So some of the things that we’re thinking about are all of the different kinds of ways that people might want to share different kinds of content with different audiences. So I talked about Groups earlier on the call. That’s something that half a billion people are using. It’s currently a feature within the Facebook app. 
Giving experiences like that room to breathe and really develop to be their own brand, I think, is a huge and valuable thing. It’s not necessarily the next thing that we’re going to go do, but it’s kind of an example of the type of audience and type of content that people might want to share. 
Examples of things that we have done are Messenger is a really big focus for us, and we’re focusing on that as a standalone experience. Instagram is a different kind of community than Facebook. We just launched Instagram Direct within Instagram, which is one on one or small group photo and video sharing. And you can kind of view that as the kind of experience that we’re going to be rolling out. 
But there’s a lot of space here, for a lot of different kinds of things, and what I think you should take away from this is that while the core business growth is going to come from the main app that exists, just because the numbers are so much bigger than everything else today, that that’s going to just be where most of the momentum comes from. 
You should also expect us to start building a few of these other things that we’ll focus on over a long period of time and hopefully build into meaningful things, like Messenger and Instagram are today.

The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. 
Brian Pitz - Jefferies & Company 
Mark, last week on the Facebook developer’s blog, there was an entry that noted you were testing placement of ads in third party mobile apps. Just wondered if you could provide an update on how these tests may be going. And then separately, it appears that the growth on desktop ads reaccelerated during the quarter. Can you talk a bit about the drivers of that?
Sheryl Sandberg 
On the Facebook ads in third-party mobile apps, it’s a small test we just started that aims to show Facebook ads off of Facebook for mobile apps. So we don’t have results yet. We are very excited about the mobile app space in general. If you look at our mobile app installation [adds], we’ve really done a great job working with developers to help users discover and download their apps. And the product we rolled out last quarter, which is the engagement ads, then help developers get people engaged or reengaged in their apps. And so it’s a small, important, and growing space, and we feel really good about the progress we’ve made with those ads on Facebook. When you look at off-Facebook, really early test.
David Ebersman 
In terms of desktop, I’d say the two trends that really benefitted desktop in the fourth quarter were similar to what we described earlier. One was just holiday strength that we saw in the business and the second was the strong performance of newsfeed ads, which we show in both mobile and desktop. So that worked well for us in the fourth quarter, just recognizing still that the user numbers on desktop continue to sort of decline modestly overall, and that’s obviously an important headwind for the revenue from that part of the business.

The next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank 
Mark, I had a follow up from one of the previous questions, on closing the loop in mobile. You guys have made a lot of progress improving the total mobile ad experience, yet there’s still a lot of friction in downloading apps and making purchases today. You guys have recently rolled out some new ad formats, and you have some partnerships with the likes of Braintree and Stripe and some of the other payment guys. So what’s your vision for removing some of this friction for marketers, and do you envision a scenario where users can buy physical or digital products within the Facebook mobile apps?
Sheryl Sandberg 
I can take this. Obviously, the mobile app world is a new world, and not just the functionality in ads is still developing, but the functionality of what then people can do. You can do a lot more on the desktop in many ways than you can on mobile. I think the best role we play is to help connect consumers with marketers and with companies and services, and I think reducing the friction there is really important. We don’t have any plans to go into the direct ecommerce market, because the advertising products we provide I think are the best thing we can provide to help grow this market.

Tom Forte - Telsey Advisory Group
On contextual advertising, this is essentially the Holy Grail for Facebook, and I think you understand this. Can you talk about where we are as far as innings on getting contextual ads? And can you talk about the role that Instagram plays with visually appealing ads and the role that video plays?
Sheryl Sandberg 
As I said, and I’ve talked about each quarter, targeting is a huge, huge issue for us, and a huge opportunity and challenge. Our goal is in a privacy safe way to get information we can about what consumers want, and then help connect marketers, so that the ad experience is great for users. We’re serving relevant ads. Whether that information comes from the kind of things people like on Facebook or other websites they visit, or contextual statements they might make in their status updates, our goal is to use that information in a privacy safe way to improve the targeting of the ads on Facebook.
To take one example, if you look at what’s happening with our direct response business, which has been a very strong segment for us, if you look at people trying to find consumers, we offer the opportunity to get people before they search. We can judge interest based on other things, other things they’re interested in, and give people the opportunity to find consumers before they search so that they can then move them all the way down the funnel into purchase.

The next question comes from Jordan Rohan with Stifel.
Jordan Rohan - Stifel Nicolaus 
I’m curious if you could help me understand the international market development and modernization for Facebook’s ad platforms. Specifically, can you speak to the buildout of international direct sales force, the channel partners, the number of international markets, in which FBX is operational, and the extent of geographic rollout of the cost per install ad units in the newsfeed? Is that available everywhere? Where are we compared to the U.S.?
Sheryl Sandberg 
The buildout globally is going well. We’ve always been pretty conservative. We wait until we have a very strong user base in other countries, and we wait until there’s a developed ad market. But we’re growing. We have a PMD ecosystem, which now covers 45 countries. I was actually in Turkey at the beginning of last week and had a chance to meet with our advertising partners there, and they are increasingly using our platform to reach consumers. We are growing our offices. We’re growing our offices in Asia particularly this year, and we’ve rolled out offices across Europe as well. In terms of rolling out products, we tend to roll out products in our most developed markets first. And as we extend those products, we then extend them to the rest of the world.

The next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Company.
Colin Sebastian - Robert Baird 
I just have a couple of questions. The first one, I guess, on app install ads, if you could quantify how much those are driving growth in newsfeed advertising. And if not specifically, then maybe on a relative basis, through other mobile ad formats? And then second, Mark, the company has made some interesting hires in the area of machine learning, and I’m curious if you could characterize how important this initiative is to the company, and how you think that AI will help Facebook over time.
Sheryl Sandberg 
On the first, we’re excited about our mobile app install ads and our mobile app engagement ads. It’s a small but growing category. We don’t split out by segment. But one thing that’s really important to note is that our mobile ad strength is very broad-based. Our mobile ads are not just bought by people who are looking to drive engagement or usage of mobile apps, but is very broad-based. We’re being used by SMBs, brand advertisers, and direct response advertisers as well.
Mark Zuckerberg 
And I can speak to some of the deep learning work. In the last quarter, Yann Lecun, one of the really earliest folks, and one of the founders of deep learning, and a professor at NYU, joined us to lead our AI group. And this is a long term research group that we have. It’s going to fit into our strategy over a longer, maybe five or ten year, period. 
And their goal is really just to try to understand how everything on Facebook is connected, by understanding what the posts that people write mean, and the content that is in the photos and videos that people are sharing, help people with tasks like if you’re sharing a voice clip in messenger, being able to transcribe that for people, so that they can receive it more easily. 
So these are some pretty big tasks in AI that are things that we have teams that are working on that will need to be researched over time, and will have obvious implications for the products that we do, but over time the real value will be if we can understand the meaning of all the content that people are sharing, that we can just provide much more relevant experiences for people across everything that we do. 
Internally, we talk about our strategy, and there’s a three-year strategy, a five-year strategy, and a 10-year strategy. And the three-year plan is really all about building new kinds of experiences for sharing, like so many of the questions on this call have been about. The five-year approach is really mostly about helping people use their network to answer interesting questions or solve problems that they have. 
And that’s where all the Graph Search work and the open graph work and some of the early parts of the AI work that we’re doing you’re going to start to see over that period of time. And then over a 10-year period, I think you’ll really start to see a lot of the impact of some of the internet.org work that we’re doing, where hopefully we’ll see some impact a lot sooner than that as well. 
But over a 10-year period, if we can get a lot more of the world on the internet, I think that’s going to really mean a quite different world in terms of what folks in a lot of developing countries have access to in terms of some of the things I said in my opening remarks, around basic financial services, and people can get credit to start businesses, and buy homes, really life-changing stuff, or get access to health information or education materials, which I think are just a really big deal. And over the long term, we’ve always wanted to help out with that, and I think that’s where we’re going to go on that.

Our last question will come from Mark Mahaney from RBC.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets 
David, can you just talk about the sustainability of the gross margin that you had in the quarter? It seemed pretty high. And then Mark, hopefully this isn’t redundant. When you think about the potential for ad quality at Facebook over the next three to five years, and you’ve gone through a lot of learnings over the last two years on ad quality, how do you think about what the upside is? I know that’s a broad, general question, but if you think about all the different drivers, have there been certain moments when you’ve seen real gap opportunities? Are there any proxies out there that you see that you say, well, this is where Facebook could be? Any thoughts on how much higher, how much better, over the years, ad quality could be on Facebook?
David Ebersman 
I’ll start with the question on gross margins. I think in Q4, as you know, gross margins tend to be seasonally strong, because revenue goes up in the fourth quarter and the costs associated with operating our infrastructure don’t go up accordingly with the seasonal strength in advertising revenue. So directionally, I think it’s important to note we really had a great year in 2013, in terms of the efficiency investments that we made. 
But going forward, this is a compute heavy service we provide. It requires a lot of data centers and servers and infrastructure. We’re going to continue to invest in those things and we do expect to increase our infrastructure costs over time while trying to do that as efficiently as possible. 
Mark Zuckerberg 
And in terms of quality, I just think that there’s a lot of room to grow here. I said in my opening remarks that we have this long term goal of making the advertising quality content as good and as relevant and timely as the content that your friends are sharing with you. And at first blush, I think that seems kind of crazy in that your friends’ stuff will obviously always have the advantage of being immediately socially relevant to you. 
But at the same time, a lot of the folks who are advertising really invest in the quality of the content that they’re producing and putting into their ads, and improving the targeting of their ads to deliver the right messages to the right people. And I don’t think that there’s a single step function that we’re going to see here, although there are things like the video formats that really enable new kinds of rich experiences, that folks who can invest in building those can really benefit from. 
At the same time, I think a lot of this is going to be incremental. So as we make improvements, more advertisers come into the system, and as more advertisers come into the system, we have more options of relevant content to show to people, and that improves the quality as well. So this is just going to be something that we’re going to focus on for a while, and there’s a long way to go before we get to the quality level that we want. But I think over a multiyear period, we can get there, or at least very close. 
Sheryl Sandberg 
And that’s a nice way to end the call, because one of the really big opportunities we have is to make these ads [at scale] more personal. So just as we can have social context, obviously, from the user content, we put social context into ads. So we can take these ads that marketers can deliver up scale, improve the targeting, and give them social context, which will help drive the kind of opportunities Mark is talking about to make the ads as relevant as the user content.

And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks, Deborah and thanks everyone for joining today. This has been a busy quarter at Facebook where we planted the seeds to achieve our long-term goals with internet.org, our AI group and our efforts to build the knowledge economy. We continue to see strong overall engagement and are making good progress in our strategy, especially in mobile. This contributes to the result we have reported today. Strong revenue growth, strong growth in daily active and good growth in engagement, as our ratio of daily actives to monthly actives continues to grow.
We have also reached new milestones as a mobile company. Now 49% of our revenue comes from mobile and 48% of the people use Facebook in any given day are only accessing it from mobile. That's almost half of the people only using Facebook from their phones, and it's a pretty incredible sign of how Facebook is evolved over the last year.
On our last earnings call, I talked about our three big goals for the next phase of our company, connecting everyone, understanding the world and helping to build the knowledge economy.
Connecting everyone means giving everyone in the world the power to use the internet and stay connected to the peoples and things that matters them. Understanding the world means helping people not just share day-to-day updates, but also building up long-term knowledge about the world and being able to answer questions for you that no other service can.
Building the knowledge economy is about helping people create growth in jobs and supporting a larger economic shift in the world based on information and ideas. This framework can tell off things about our progress as a company over the next few years, so it's useful way to look at our progress over this quarter as well. We'll start with connecting the world.
This quarter, we took an important step. In August, we launched internet.org, a global effort Samsung, Ericsson, QUALCOMM and other industry leaders to make affordable internet access available to everyone in the world.
Today, only about a third of the world's population is online and internet's is growing more slowly than you probably expect less than 9% a year. We want to change that. Our mission has always been to connect the world and to us that means everyone. When the next 5 billion people have a chance to use these basic services and participate in the global economy, that's going to create huge benefits for everyone in the world.
By working together on technology and new business models, we think we can help accelerate the process of connecting everyone. We believe we are in a unique place to help encourage broader growth of the Internet, because so much of what people do on the Internet is Facebook.
According to comScore, around 20% of the time that people spend in apps in the U.S. alone is in Facebook services when you a lot of people in developing countries what service they care about using most, the answer is often Facebook.
We are already trying to make access to Facebook cheaper. All the same tools of innovation that we are developing to do this can be applied to other basic Internet services as well, but messaging, search, whether and Wikipedia to make those services cheaper or free to deliver.
We also recently acquired Onavo, business team that builds world-class data compression technology in mobile analytics and they will play an important role in helping us build more efficient technologies and services that use less data. Of course no single company can do this alone and we are working closely with our partners to develop our future plans. It's still very early for internet.org and we will have more to say in the months ahead, but I am very excited about this effort and I am grateful to our partners for being a part of it.
Next, let's talk about understanding the world. What I mean by this is that everyday people post billions of pieces of content and connections into the graph. In doing this, they are helping to build the clearest models of everything there is to know in the world.
A big part of why this works is that people can share things with any audience they want. They don't have to share publicly with everyone at the time. they can share with just their friends, so this means that the model the world that people are building our systems include things that people only want to share with just a few people. This has the potential to be really powerful, but right now we have to do very little to utilize the knowledge that people have shared to benefit everyone in our community.
The service we invest in the most news feeds, which gives you a great sense of what's going on with your community today. The news feed has proved itself incredibly useful for people and the most used app on peoples scoring by far, but this is just the start of what's possible.
When we get to the point, where everyone can easily ask any question to Facebook and get it answered by our community. That's going to be very powerful.
In the last quarter, there had been several important evolutions in our strategy of understanding the world. The first is around Graph Search. At the beginning of this year, we announced the first beta version of the service on desktop and that indexed more than 1 trillion connections between people in this segment.
In the last quarter, we started testing what we call host search allows you to search all the unstructured text and posts that people have ever made on Facebook. About 1.2 trillion more posts. The folks on the team who have worked on web search engines in the past tell me that the Graph Search corpus is bigger than any other web search index out there. It's still early for Graph Search, because it's still in beta, only in English and we haven't launched our mobile version yet, but it's something I am really excited about.
Another evolution in our progress to understand the world is around our efforts to building mobile apps. Our goal has always been to help people share anything they want with anyone they want. Historically, we have done this by building a lot of features into the core Facebook app, but we also have a few separate apps that are widely used like Instagram and messenger, our standalone messaging app. These are each large services that help people share in different ways Instagram enables more than 150 monthly actives to share beautiful photos also more publicly than people would want to share on Facebook.
Messenger is part of how people spend billions of private one-to-one and group messages every day and with the latest release of the app yesterday, we are continuing to add features and make this a better experience. In the future, we expect to develop more services help people share different content with different groups of people and we will continue to build up messenger as better distinct messaging experience.
There is one more evolution in our strategy to understand the world that I want to mention. In September, we formed the Facebook AI Group to do world-class artificial intelligence research using all the knowledge that people have shared on Facebook. The goal here is to use new approaches in AI to help make sense of all the content that people share so we can generate new insights about the world to answer people's questions.
We started assembling a team of some of the best people in the field to work on these problems. We also announced the acquisition of Mobile Technologies, a speech recognition and machine translation company that will help expand our work in the field beyond just photo recognition to voice. Over time, I think it is going to be possible to build services that are much more natural to interact with and can help solving many more problems than any existing technologies today. I am excited that we are working on this problem and I am looking forward to doing a lot more here.
Finally, let's talk about the progress we have made towards building the knowledge economy. The key to building the knowledge economy is building tools for everyone to use information to do their jobs better. So in addition to connecting everyone and understanding the world, we are also focused on building new services for businesses as a way to accelerate the growth of this new economy.
The way businesses will experience this effort is that we will keep building better services for them to reach their customers with higher quality ads, more efficient leads with better targeting, better analytics and using richer formats. The way people will experience this effort is that the ads they see will become more and more relevant to their lives.
Last quarter, I started talking about how our approach going forward would be to grow our business through improving the quality of our ads rather than by just increasing the quantity. This quarter we have continue to do this. And the results show our approach is working.
We have been able to deliver better content and grow business for our customers and ourselves. We are planning that a lot more people are finding their ads useful and engaging with them and the average daily actives is engaging with more than ad per week.
Most people probably wouldn't expect to engage with ads that often, so I think it's a great time that people are finding ads useful and they are adding value to the experience on Facebook. I think there is still a lot of room to improve the quality of our ads and grow our business over time. So this is something that we are going to keep on investing in going forward.
So that's my update on how we are thinking about the next big changes we want to make in the world. Connecting everyone, understanding the world and building the knowledge economy. We have made a lot of progress this quarter and I want to take a moment to thank everyone who works with our company and everyone who is a part of our community for all the efforts that make Facebook great.
Looking ahead, you can expect us to keep preparing for the future, even as we keep on building momentum today. As I said in our original S-1 filing, we don't build services to make money, we make money to build better services. This approach has served people who use Facebook, marketers and our entire Facebook community well. It's a different way of looking at the world but its how we are going to keep succeeding as a company.
Thank you for being with us today and now I am going to hand it over to Sheryl.
Sheryl Sandberg
Thanks, Mark. We continue to see strong growth in our ads business, especially mobile. Q3 total ad revenue grew 66% year-over-year to $1.8 billion and mobile ad revenue grew to 49% of our total ad revenue. This is a remarkable milestone in a short time since we initiated mobile newsfeed ads just last year. Similar to last quarter, our performance is very broad based with strong growth across all geographies and types of marketers. At the same time, our overall user engagement metrics remained strong. We think this validates the careful approach we are taking to the building our ads business.
I would like to highlight some of the key drivers of our performance this quarter. These are, to a large degree, the results of investments we have made over the past few years and they will continue to be our priorities going forward. The first driver is the continued growth of mobile engagement around the world. In 2013, for the very first time, people will spend more time with digital media than watching TV. Emarketer estimates more than 5.25 hours a day on digital services including mobile compared with 4.5 hours watching TV in the U.S.
Facebook is well-positioned to benefit from this shift. In the United States, Facebook including Instagram, just one in eight minutes people spend on the desktop, but one in five minutes on mobile. According to comScore, Facebook and Instagram have more mobile time spent than many of the next largest services including YouTube, Pandora, Yahoo, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, AOL, Snapchat and LinkedIn combined. Along with this engagement, we believe that we have the best mobile ad product with ads that are integrated unit into newsfeed for people who spend the most of their time on Facebook.
As people shift where they spend their time, marketers are starting to follow. Our results today show that we are benefiting from this shift to mobile and we believe this shift will continue and will continue to benefit us. Today, mobile represents 12% of consumer media time, but it's still only 3% of ad budget. The second driver of our performance is an increasing number of marketers spending their ad dollars on Facebook.
From brand to direct response, to local businesses to developers, more marketers are advertising on Facebook, because they recognize that our ads work to drive sales. This growth is taking place globally. In the third quarter, the number of Facebook advertisers in EMEA, nearly equaled the number in North America, reflecting global growth in our online advertising.
The third driver of our growth is product development. We are working in a number of areas to make the ad people see on Facebook better. More targeted ads are better and we are improving our ad targeting to increase relevance. We are investing in features like custom audience and partner categories to improve targeted. These are great tools that are still in their early days and we will continue to invest.
We also want to make it easier for marketers of all sizes to buy ads and measure their impact. In late September, we rolled out ad format changes, make ad a bit more consistent across Facebook and we reduced the number of ad units marketers have to choose from to reduce complexity. Then earlier this month, we rolled out a full redesign of our ad buying tools to simplify the ads creation process. Advertisers now select from one of eight business objectives such as website conversion are [often].
We think these product investments make it easier for marketers to achieve their goals. We are also expanding our products for developers. We already have launched mobile app install ads and these are going very well and we now launched mobile app install ads for engagement. These ads help developers and businesses reach people that have already installed their apps and direct them back to increased engagement. We believe these apps are a nice complement to our install ads and represent a unique opportunity.
We also continued to invest in helping brands stay with our campaigns and increase same-store sales. We recently launched Outcome Measurement for the telecommunications industry. An initial test showed that more than 90% of people who made a purchase after viewing a Facebook ad have never clicked on that ad. This shows that impressions matter and focusing only on clicks does not tell the whole story.
Similarly, a recent study by (Inaudible), one of our leading preferred market developer partners proves this point. The (Inaudible) study found that marketers who use the multi-touch attributions to measure campaign ROI credited 12% to 13% more value from Facebook than marketers to use off-click attributions, but we still have work to do. Brand marketers aren't moving as quickly as we would like and we believe measurement is key to influencing the app advertisers.
Another important trend influencing our growth is our preferred marketing developer of PMD program. Over the past few years, we have invested in building an ecosystem that supports all types of marketers and PMD has helped those marketers advertise effectively with us. Today, this program is a community of hundreds of technology and service companies spread across more than 45 countries.
In summary, we think our strong performance this quarter further validates that our ads strategy is working. Marketers are responding favorably as we heard during ad week in New York. Our messages around reach, targeting and measurements are resonating and will continue to reinforce them. Our ads are getting better and we still have a long way to go.
Moving forward, our focus remains the same, continuing to capitalize on a shift to mobile, increasing the number of marketers who advertise with us and continuing to invest in our ad products. We believe that we are in the early stages of a major transitioning and advertising and we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on that opportunity. Now, David.
David Ebersman
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon everyone. Q3 was a strong quarter for us in terms of our financial results. Our business grew rapidly around the world and we are pleased with our performance across our key financial metrics highlighted by the fact that Q3 was our first $2 billion quarter in terms of revenue. Let's start with the size and engagement of the Facebook community, which continues to grow. 728 million people used Facebook on an average day in September, up 25% from last year, continues to be driven by mobile.
In Q3 for the first time, daily access on web declined year-over-year, albeit very modestly. Daily users represented 61% of the 1.19 billion people who accessed Facebook during the month of September and our overall engagement data remains strong. Also as we announced in September, Instagram now is over 150 million monthly actives.
I want to say a few words about used engagement on Facebook. As we have said previously, this is a hard issue for us to measure, because self-reported age data is unreliable for younger users. So we have developed other analytical methods to help us estimate usage by age.
Our best synopsis on youth engagement in the U.S. reveals that usage of Facebook among U.S. teens overall was stable from Q2 to Q3. So we did see a decrease in daily users specifically among younger teens.
We won't typically call out such granular data, especially when it's of questionable statistical significance given the lack of precision of our age estimates for younger users. But we wanted to share this with you now since we get a lot of questions about teens.
We are pleased that we remain close to fully penetrated among teens in the U.S., our monthly user numbers remain steady and overall engagement on Facebook remains strong. We will continue to focus our development efforts to build products that drive engagement for people of all ages.
Turning to the financials. Total revenue in Q3 was $2 billion, up 60% and ad revenue was $1.8 billion, up 66%. Exchange rates had no meaningful impact. Revenue growth was strong around the world with each of the four geographic regions we report on growing by more than 50% versus last year.
The primary drivers of ad revenue growth were an increase in the number of and the strong performance of newsfeed ads and an increase in the number of marketers using Facebook and increased demand in our system. In Q3, overall ad impressions were up 16% and the average price per ad was up 42% compared to last year.
The growth in ad impressions was primarily due to market where using our service combined with the impact of a price floor reduction late in the third quarter last year. The growth in price per ad was primarily due to the increase in news feed ads. In the U.S. and Canada, where last year's price floor change had a smaller impact, ad impressions decreased 8% and average price per ad increased over 60% compared to last year.
The decrease in ad impressions despite an increase in the number of users in the U.S. and Canada was due to the continued migration of usage to mobile devices where we show fewer ads per person compared to web. The greater than 60% increase in average price per ad in the U.S. and Canada was primarily due to the increase in the number of news feed ads shown on both mobile and web.
Due to their high engagement levels, news feed ads have a significantly higher price per ad than right hand column ads. Therefore the mix shift of our ads towards the higher percentage being in news feed versus right hand column is driving up our average price per ad.
Mobile ad revenue in Q3 was approximately 49% of our ad revenue, up from 41% in Q2. The sequential quarterly growth of mobile ad revenue was due to three factors. An increase in the average price per mobile ad, an increase in the number of mobile users and an increase in ads shown per mobile user.
Looking now at web. Ad revenue from web usage decreased both sequentially and year-over-year. Web ad revenue includes both news feed ads on web and right hand column ads on web. Revenue from news feed ads on web increased significantly in Q3, sequentially and year-over-year, driven largely by an increase in the number of news feed ads per web user. The increase was not enough to offset the revenue decline from right hand column ads.
Total payments and other fees revenue was up 24% year-over-year to $218 million and roughly flat sequentially. Payments revenue from games was up 18% from last year. So we believe 12% represents the best apples-to-apples comparisons adjusting for accounting items such as the change in revenue recognition timing from late last year. Overall ARPU of $1.72 per user was up 33% compared to last year. We saw 43% increase in the U.S. and Canada and greater than 40% gains in each of the other three regions we report on.
Turning now to expenses. In Q3, our total GAAP expenses were $1.28 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation, total expenses increased 40% to $1.03 billion, driven by higher headcount and infrastructure spend. We ended Q3 with just under 5,800 employees, up 34% from last year and we continue to be pleased with our success in attracting talent.
Our Q3 GAAP operating income was $736 million, representing a 37% operating margin up from 30% last year. And on a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $987 million, a 49% margin, up from 42% last year.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for Q3 were 41% and 36% respectively. GAAP net income was $425 million or $0.17 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $621 million or $0.25 per share, up around 100% from last year. In Q3, we spent $284 million on CapEx and free cash flow was $666 million.
Looking at our balance sheet, we ended Q3 with $9.3 billion in cash and investments. During the third quarter, we repaid our $1.5 billion term loan and replaced it with a new $6.5 billion line of credit, which is currently undrawn.
We will continue to manage our balance sheet to meet our liquidity needs, protect the business against risk and provide us with flexibility to invest in new opportunities to grow the business.
Now let's look forward. We continue to believe that improving the quality and relevance of news feed ads provides us with a big long-term opportunity, however as we think about the future, we do not expect to significantly increase ads as a percentage of news feed stories beyond where we were at the end of Q3. This is important because increasing ads in news feed has been a meaningful driver of our revenue growth in 2013, so this should be factored into your expectations for next year.
Turning to payments revenue. Remember that in the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized revenue from four months of payments transactions, so for that reasons we expect payments revenue will be down this coming Q4 compared to last year.
Looking at expenses, we now expect that our 2013 total non-GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock compensation will likely grow around 45%. In terms of our tax rate, we expect that our Q4 and full year non-GAAP tax rates will be a few percentage points higher than our Q3 rates.
Finally, we expect our 2013 CapEx to be in the neighborhood of $1.4 billion. This is down from our prior estimate of $1.6 billion due to a combination of efficiency gains and changes in the timing of our planned purchases.
To sum up, in Q3 we make great process against our key financial objectives, growing revenue, investing for growth and positioning the company to maximize long-term returns for our shareholders and we remain excited about the opportunities ahead.
Now, we are ready to open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now open the line for a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Thank you for taking the question. I just had two one for Mark, and then one for Sheryl or David.
Mark, the first one and as Facebook, value proposition is connecting the world, how should we expect Facebook in the future to more specifically leverage [geo] location, data of advertisers, to mobile ads even more useful for your users? Over what timeframe should we expect that to kind of play out in your mind?
Then the second question for Sheryl or David would just be, you talked about brand advertisers taking a little bit more time, I think, than you would have liked spent than you might have liked. Just wondering if you could help us there with that higher mix between DR and brand advertisers as kind of played out over the course of the year, if you could just give us some rough ideas. Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
The way we think, I'll take this actually. The way we think about using location data is that every time we use data, we use it in accordance with the privacy controls we offer people and we are working hard at making our ads better targeted. Over time, I think you will see the industry continue to evolve to get better at targeting more ads. We certainly see it as a significant upside for us to get better at targeting more ads, not just from geo-location data but from all kinds of different data we get based on what users do with our service.
On brand advertisers, we don't breakout the different marketer segments. Our results this quarter are based on growth in all marketer segments, including brand and we continue to make progress. We have every one of the AdAge Global 100 have advertised with us over the past year. My comment was based on the fact that marketing spend is just not keeping pace with the transition to time on line in mobile in that segment of the market. Since that segment of the market is so big, helping that transition happen present significant upside for us.
Our focus there is measurement. We have to show brand marketers that our ads drives in-store-sales and we work on that, we work on that client-by-client to share a few examples from this quarter Cadbury in the U.K. works with us to sell their cream egg product kind of find the table for Halloween to talk about candy to 16 to 24 year old. They used Facebook media for user generated post along with TV, they reached 15 million people, 21% of those people they only reached on Facebook not TV and the combined impact of TV and Facebook where sales were up 9%.
Another example because it shows how we can move awareness is the Alfa Romeo 4c launched in Portugal, (inaudible) where a person could do a test drive with a Formula One driver and they got the highest buzz they have ever had in Google Trends for a product launch.
So as we think it's a big opportunity ahead of us and you have to work on these clients, account-by-account, client-by-client. But we think as the shift to mobile and digital happens, it's a big opportunity and we are focused on helping that shift happen.

The next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Hi, thanks. Sheryl mentioned some of the tools that have been added to make it easier for advertisers to access and use the ad platform. One example was the objective-based ad buying. I was just wondering how much you would attribute reduction in friction, like the examples that were referenced on the call, leading to direct and immediate increases in flow of ad dollars versus being more gradual in nature?
Then secondly, for Mark. Mark, the concept of the knowledge economy. I was just wondering, how you envision what the consumer will be doing on the site five years from now? If today is more about and sharing and sharing is more developed than search and production integrations, how do you think about that relationship between those three activities on the site over a five-ish year time horizon? Thanks
Sheryl Sandberg
On the first. Our growth overall is based on the strong performance of news feed ads, an increase in the number of news feed ads per user and also more marketers. The simplification of products has actually been very important in attracting new marketers. If you look at the new advertisers we acquired in Q3, 62% of them started with either promoted posts or promoted page likes which are the most simple of our advertising formats.
So we are continuing to rollout very simple ways to become an advertiser is driving our growth and we will continue to. The larger question you asked was based on our focus of business objectives and that's actually really a big deal for us. We are now getting to the point where our ad product supports really helping marketers achieve their core business objectives.
So before, people use to buy via the product, what product do you want to buy. And now they are buying from, I would say, identifying, I want to get mobile app installed. I want to get mobile engagement. I want to get website conversions.
I think the fact that we are pivoting to focus on those end business results and making everything else including social a part of meeting those business results is a really important part of our strategy. It's driving our growth and I think it's going to continue to.
Operator
The next question comes from Mark May with Citigroup.
Deborah Crawford
Sorry, operator, can we just go back to the second half of that question.
David Ebersman
Yes. I just want to answer the part of question about the product experience over time. I know there are two pieces of this that we are thinking about related to the knowledge economy. The first is just helping our customers use information better to grow their businesses and create jobs. Right.
So we are thinking about small businesses and making it so they can have better insights into who their customers are and better ability to reach them. Now developers have been able to use better analytics for being able to find new customers as well. And those are a lot of the inspiration and the strategy behind the ad products that we are delivering.
On the side of the product experiences that we are creating for people who use Facebook, right now I do think that the Facebook experience is very push based, in that you go to Facebook and we are suggesting content to you through something like news feed. Overtime, I think, if we do a good job, we should be able to create more value through all of the knowledge that has been shared over time that we are not really surfacing on a day-to-day basis right now in terms of helping people answer a lot of different questions that they have around the world.
That's kind of the direction that we are starting to go in with Graph Search and a few other areas as well. But it's pretty early. So I think around a five year time frame like you are saying, hopefully we will make very significant progress towards going in that direction.
Sheryl Sandberg
Great. Next question?
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Mark May - Citigroup
Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first one for Sheryl and then David. It seems like a year and half ago around the time of the IPO, the company was very focused on top of the funnel brand related advertising. But over the last year or so, it's been much more around direct response but certainly get the sense that on the top of the funnel brand is starting to move in a more meaningful way. What is the company doing and what are some of the main projects that you are working on that you think will really start to move to dial on the top of the funnel segment of the market. What role does video maybe play into that?
Then for David regarding the ad load comment had ad load not increased in North America, give us a sense of what the ad revenue growth would have been if you normalize for that? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
Top of the funnel ads remain really important to us. Again, our growth this quarter was a very broad based, including top of the funnel ads. The reason they are important is that Facebook is such a unique and powerful discovery place. When you are on Facebook, you are open to discover, you are open to getting messages and that's what we are seeing with news feed messages from friends and with us as well.
The key for us is measurement, the way we are really going to make progress is better measurement. It's easier to understand and measure a click that goes to return online sales. It's harder to measure how you - household that see ads and don't see ads change their purchase behavior in stores
The thing I think we have done a lot over the last year and we are continuing to do that to put those measurements in place, so I talked on in my opening remarks about measurement of telecom. We have also done a ton of work around CPG, so that we can look at households that saw an ad, households that didn't see in an ad and what their difference is.
Just to share one more example, (Inaudible) did a promotion with us for the (Inaudible) in the U.S. They were targeting 35 to 43 seen ads in months, because we were able to do this type of measurement that we could have a year ago, we were able to show that they get side extra turn on their ad spend. We measured household spending who saw their ads versus household who didn't saw their ads and there was a 9% difference.
They were also able to tell that a lot of those 9% was driven by new buyers of their products, which is what they want, so I do think we have a big opportunity, I do think the brands are going to continue to need to be convinced account-by-account, but this moves products off shelf and that's what we are doing.
David Ebersman
Mark, thanks for your question. This is David. Truly not possible to tease out individual contributions because the way the auction works, everything is dependent, so if we have fewer ads that's going to play out with different pricing and other sorts of things, so I can give you sort of our gut feel for it, but I can't quantify precisely.
If you look at overall ad revenue growth for example on that third quarter compared to the second quarter, there is probably three factors that are contributed materially that are important to understand. One is just growth in users. Second is growth in demand, which plays out into pricing. Then the third is an increase in the number of ads that we showed in news feed per users.
I would probably order the ad load, probably third of the straight relative to the sequential growth. I think it plays out a little bit differently on mobile versus web. On mobile, we really increased the number of ads as a percentage of the overall mobile experience quite modestly in the third quarter versus the second quarter.
On web, the increase in the number of ads or the percentage of ads in the web news feed experience went up more significantly than mobile did in the third quarter versus the second.
Operator
Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Okay. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask you about two things. First on video, can you talk about what you have learned from the recent launch of video on Instagram and how that may have shaped your thinking on rolling out video ads on Facebook?
Then secondly, just following-up on the ad volume, just to clarify when you are saying the ad volume won't necessarily increase any more beyond where it was at the end of Q3. Is that on average or in the more penetrated markets? Then can you comment relative to the 5% of stories in the news feed that you mentioned last quarter? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg
The experience with video on Instagram has been very positive so far, right? I think that we proved that having a quick start auto play can be a good experience inline in the feed and that people really feel they are in and control they are experience. They can just grow if they don't like content. If it's good content then that can be really good, so we are heartened by that.
This is that important launch for Facebook overall, because the addition of video content to the stream could be one of the most positive things that we have done in a long time for making it more engaging, but if we do it quarterly then it could also be a negative thing and we are trying to take our time to make sure that we do this in a very positive way and I am pretty confident that we will. But that's why you are seeing us take the process that we have on this.
Sheryl Sandberg
Now I will add on videos ads. We do have a video ad product today, because any one can embed a video in page post. And we are actually seeing very good results, particularly around entertainment and media. This is driving some of our ad spend. And the area remains pretty exciting because this is a very compelling way for marketers to tell their story.
David Ebersman
So I thought you asked what we mean when we say ad volume won't increase. So the first thing I would say is, I would frame that in the context as a percentage of the user experience. Obviously, if we can drive more engagement that provides more opportunity for us to show more ads. In general, I think your question referenced whether this was geographic.
The ad load in news feed is reasonably consistent across the world. It's a little bit less in the least developed markets because we have less advertiser there. But it's not different grossly different. So I think that comment holds generally across most of the markets where we make our advertising dollars.
In terms of relative to the 5%. So what we said last quarter was that, of the total volume of stories in news feed, about 5% of those were ads. As I said on the last question, the mobile piece of that didn't change very substantially in the third quarter versus the second. The web percentage did go up. So if you mix those two together, the Q3 number would be modestly higher than the 5% number from Q2.

The next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Justin Post with Merrill Lynch, your line is open.
The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Great, thanks. Two question. First, David, could you just give us some color or why the reduction in the OpEx growth for this year? Were there certain investment projects you decided to cut? And what were those and why?
Then secondly. Mark, this kind of five year vision of moving towards, going from push base to pull based, that opens up a lot of opportunities. I mean that's been kind of the sauce maybe behind Google and it's an interesting part of Twitter, et cetera. But could you talk about the challenges in order to get there, and maybe both in terms of user experience the advertiser opportunity, how difficult and substantial the technology challenges are to get there? It's a very different direction and there is lot of opportunity but how do you get from point A to point B? Thanks.
David Ebersman
Hi, Mark. In terms of OpEx growth, so we are continuing to invest aggressively in the business with particular emphasis on technical hiring and building out our infrastructure. At the same time, we are trying to do this in a disciplined fashion making sure that all the investments we make and the dollars we spend are spent wisely in terms of furthering our mission and creating returns for the company.
I am really quite pleased with how things are going in that regard in 2013. From an R&D standpoint, we are really on track for anything ahead of what we expected to be in terms of hiring and spend. And that's surely the most important area for us in terms of investing to drive future growth.
In other areas of the business, such as cost of revenue, G&A, marketing and sales, I think we are ramping up spend less than we anticipated for a couple of reasons. One is better success than we expected in some of the efficiency projects that are helping to keep the company small, even as revenue ramps up. A second reason is, some slower than expected ramp up in both hiring in new projects. And then the third contributing factor is just we have in the budget some expectations for the unplanned stuff that comes along that can drive spend, like an asset acquisition or something like that and we really haven't spent this much money as we have expected in the unplanned areas.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yes, and to your question about on how do we make the knowledge that's been shared in Facebook more useful. The first thing we needed to do is just index it all and build the infrastructure to start being able to use it in different ways. I mean the first data for Graph Search, we had indexed to more than a trillion connections, friendship connections, group membership, like connections and then for post search, we indexed more than a trillion of the post that people that people have put into the system.
The basic insight that we think we are operating on here, is that right now a lot of the behavior and engagement on Facebook is very day-to-day where you are sharing something and Facebook is the best place for you to share photos or events that's going on in your life and if you go to news feed and see what's going on with the people around you.
What has happened is that, over the past almost 10 years of this behavior, this amazing base of knowledge has been build up, but there is trillions of pieces of content and information that now we are just trying to find different ways to expose and basically make that more useful to people instead of just the stuff that's been shared in the last day or so.
Graph Search is one way that you can see that coming to light in terms of people being able to do directed queries for different types of content. There are other kind of services that we think we can build as well that just a few people more utility from the corpus of knowledge that's been built out and that's going to be a big focus for us over the next few years.
Operator
Your next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch
Mark, after a successful revenue year, you kind of start next year with a clean slate and you highlighted some big ambitions in your prepared remarks about access and improving search. Just maybe you remind us how you think about driving profit growth as you look at the company relative to kind of your long-term objectives for the company. Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg
Well. I mean, we care a lot about that. In terms of the shareholder value that we are generating as well. I think in the recent results and what I said at the end of my remarks there was that, we are going to keep on planting seeds for our future growth while continuing to build momentum now and I know that's a philosophy that we have taken in term of building the company. We generally wanted to be profitable as such, but I don't think we are going to commit or have any specific guidance on this right now.
Operator
The next question comes from Carlos Karjner with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
Carlos Karjner - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you. Mark, can you talk a little bit more about how the knowledge in the Facebook graph compares with the knowledge in the overall web today qualitatively and quantitatively? Is there a plan to connect the worldwide web graph to the Facebook graph when you think the answer that you are going to give people into future?
Secondly, the graph regulation in the European Commission in Brazil at least may require internet companies such as Facebook to store all their data locally. What do you think will be the impact on Facebook's CapEx and expenses if these regulations are indeed implemented? Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yes. Sure. On your question about the graph of Facebook, the graph that people share on Facebook versus the web overall, I think they are pretty different. In terms of quantity, they are getting to a pretty comparable size, so engineers on the graph search teams have told me folks who have worked on other web search engines before tell me that the scale of things like post search are as big or bigger than any web search index that's out there but they are they are just different used cases with different kinds of knowledge and people are going to use them for different things, so our approach with Graph Search is not to build something which is web search.
I mean, we think that companies have done that and they are doing a good job at that, but there is different kinds of knowledge. Things that you want more opinion on from people that you trust that I think is kind of a late inside Facebook that we need to do a better job of servicing that, so that's going to be the focus on that.
I mean, over time, there are a lot of possibilities for things that we can do and I am not really ready to talk about a lot of them today, but you can kind of look at what we have launched in the couple of the Graph Search launches that we have done so far and we are pretty early in that journey.
David Ebersman
Carlos, the second part of your question about draft legislation or discussion about companies needing to store data locally in various companies, it's an interesting question and definitely something we are tracking, but the answer is really going to depend on the details of what that looks like. It's very hard assess what kind of implication it would have for company like Facebook without understanding what we would need to do, so, we will continue to pay less attention to it, but really hard to give anything in the way of the specific answer at this point.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.
Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Company
Thanks. Can you give us some color on how many advertisers you guys ended the quarter? How that grew? And if there is a way to think about how many advertisers have claimed pages so we can get a sense of how deep the penetration is. Because it looks like you guys are more successful than other companies and growing at a faster rate, particularly on the local penetration side? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
So last quarter we reported that we had a million active advertisers and that number continues to grow and continues to grow healthily. We believe, globally, we have 20 million small businesses, local businesses of some kind who have pages. So obviously just a fraction of those are advertisers.
And I think its one of the most exciting opportunities in front of Facebook. It's really hard to get small businesses to use technological products and 20 million small businesses are using us and we haven't gone out and done aggressive sales efforts to make that happen.
Going from having a page that you are using for organic distribution to paid distribution, it's something we are very,-very focused on. It's why we rolled out these simple products. And I think our track record at doing that is good and we plan on getting better at it.
Operator
The next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
David, sorry to beat a dead horse, but back to the ads per user comment. Can you give us some color on, I guess since you guys started the mobile news feed ads a year and change ago, how much CPC and click through rate improvement you have been able to drive? And should we think about it, going forward if mobile users are growing at 18% in the U.K., 20% in the U.S. and I think 60% for ROW, should we think about revenue growth as a slight premium to that but somewhat co-related to that? Thanks.
David Ebersman
Sure, Ross. So I think if you look back over the last year, some of the metrics that I think have been most positive for us have been, as we have ramped from a very low volume, very few ads shown in news feeds to larger numbers, what one could reasonably have expected given the way the auction dynamics work, is that the pricing would really come down as we were delivering more clicks and as we were I think deeper into the pool of the advertising demand.
And the way pricing has really held up and click rates have held up and CPCs have held up, as we have progressed through this over the last year, I think has really validated our confidence that news feed ads were going to be really important product that could really drive the performance of the business. So we remain really encouraged and pleased by that.
Going forward. Clearly, we will try to continue to grow the user base, as you described, and that's been an important part of our revenue growth since the company started. And the other opportunity is for us is continue to improve the quality, the relevance and the performance of the ads and to drive up pricing by bringing more demand into our system. We are certainly doing a good job of that right now and we have got to continue to execute.

The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric Sheridan - UBS
Sure. Thanks, guys. Two quick questions. One, following up on the last one with respect to ROI around advertising products going forward. I guess, maybe more for Sheryl, but how do you guys think about the dialogue between advertisers and yourself about ROI and how much of that fits with measurement and attribution tools that you guys would need to develop internally versus what they need to think about in terms of the ROI on your properties versus other online and offline properties.
And second question on mobile app install ads. Question about the diversification of the advertiser base and how that sort of developed since the product has been launched? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
So the first question, it's really both. In order to measure all the way from seeing a Facebook ad through to a purchase, particularly when that's offline. That takes work and tools on our side including the data systems and it also takes thinking about measurement on their side.
The industry overall is moving. We have been really pleased to see more embracing of multi-click over last step attribution. You can see that happening with a number of big players in the industry. The PMDs are really important here. The PMDs are good at helping people and helping marketers measure.
But really the developers' measurement system take our measurement, take industry measurements. Particularly for brand advertisers, they also take some rethinking of the ways they have measured ads and ads' performance before and we work very closely with our clients on that.
On mobile app install and mobile engagement ads, we are very focused on growing across the board. We want growth in all of our marketer segments and we want to grow that broadly across the world.
Developers are really interesting place for us, because we think not only do we have we think the best mobile ad product in general, because people spend a lot of their time in news feed. They spend more time in news feed than they spend on any other part of our service. That gives us an opportunity to sell ads broadly, but it also gives a great opportunity for developers, because the developers want people to do happen on their mobile phones and on their desktop.
Mobile app install ads have been very successful for us and they are interesting, because the mobile app install market didn't even exist a few years ago. I think the move to rollout engagement ads further deepens our relationship with developers and shows that we can help different users and then we can get those users to continuously use their products, so we are pretty excited about this part of market, because we think it can grow quickly and we think our ad products and offerings are so unique.

Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo
Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. You introduced hashtags in June and I am just wondering if you could comment on usage trends. How strategically important hashtags are to index in the knowledge graph going forward and where their hashtags could become a meaningful part of an ad targeting opportunity in the future if usage catches on in a significant way. Thank you
Mark Zuckerberg
The launch of hashtags was more just following behavior that we see from people, right? All we really did was take hashtag that people are putting into the product and make them linked, so if you could find other posts that have the same tag.
The effort that I think you are latching on to is basically we are putting some more effort now into both, public content on Facebook and more private content, right? As there are a bunch of different sets of people that a person will want to share with, one is all of their friends, but a lot of the sharing and the communication done is one-on-one in messaging or with small groups or with the communities.
Then there is a large set of content that's public, which is often very high quality content as well and we have efforts in all of those areas to make a set people can share all of those different kinds of contents on Facebook. That's going to be something that we are going to continue to do.

The next question comes from Brian Novak with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak - Susquehanna
Thanks. I have two please. You continue rolling out a lot of new products, I was wondering if you could speak to the to the traction and kind of anything user adoption of the early topical and interest trending that you have rolled out.
Last quarter you talked about strengthened e-commerce driving some of the advertising which kind of verticals would you speak to this quarter and as we are heading into the holiday season, you still see e-commerce as being a big driver again? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yes. You are asking about the effectiveness of some of the public content efforts that we have done. I think it's starting to do very well and we are very pleased with it. Some of the questions that we have gotten has asked if this is an area that we have started focusing on recently, which actually it isn't something we have been working on for a while, but I think the question as a sign that the results are starting to be quite good and folks are starting to note it. The traffic that we are driving and the higher quality content that's public that people came for us on Facebook, so we are going to keep focusing on this.
It's not just about public content, it's about giving people the power to share with every different audience that they want, weather it's most private one-on-one communication and tread up to the most public content that you want to get out for everyone in the world to be able to consume, down the road we are going to keep watching all of that.
Sheryl Sandberg
To your second question, direct response including e-commerce continues to perform well. We have high click-through competitive CPC, so we are attractive from marketers. When you think about verticals, I think we have very tremendous opportunity in basically all of them.
Things that are performing particularly well right now financial services, media and entertainment, e-commerce, professional services. But if you look to a vertical like auto, that we haven't historically been strong in, I think we are starting to make real inroads, client-by-client, like the Alfa Romeo case study I showed, because we had such a great opportunity to engage the people they want to reach.
Our targeting is also getting better. So with custom audiences and partner categories, we are able to identify, here the people you want to show your ads to who, we believe are in the market to buy a car, for example. And so the combination of the measurement work we are doing and the ability to target, I think means we have a strong play in every vertical.

The next question comes from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Your line is open.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG
Hi. I really wanted to ask you about the Instagram blog post that you put up the other week, where you stated specifically that, I think the quote from the blog was, you want ads to be creative and engaging, and that seems pretty different than most of the advertising that I have seen on Facebook, whether on mobile or on the desktop. I wanted to ask you how do you think, or is it possible that if this strategy of advertising works well on Instagram, could we actually see a new form of advertising appear on Facebook sometime in 2014 or 2015.
Sheryl Sandberg
So what we announced last week is a small test with 10 advertisers to start showing ad in the Instagram feed. And we are excited about it because there is a lot of interest and a lot of excited brands. When you think about ads being exciting and engaging, I think we think about two things. We think about ads that fit the format of the product that they are part of.
So the Instagram ads right now are the pictures and videos which are exactly what people post on Instagram. If you look at the progress we have made with our news feed ads, those ads, those in the size, the shape. You know they got larger when they moved over from the right hand side, right hand column but they are also meant to be as exciting, as engaging as the content.
So our goal is, we want our ads to be as good as the user shared content. Some of them are, a lot of them aren't. We have a lot of room to grow in improving that quality. But in terms of the excitement you will see or the interest, that is our goal. And we are just going to match the format of the products we are working with as we rollout ads.

Operator, we have time for one last question.

The next question comes from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.
Brian Wieser - Pivotal Research
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have taken notice of the number of businesses advertising. I was wondering if you could just quantify the number of new small businesses perhaps or number of advertisers going beyond that one million in the quarter? The reason I ask is, I am trying to understand to what degree that maybe the shift is spending mix towards smaller business may have contributed to margin expansion. And maybe can talk about the margin profile that different segments of marketers bring to your business?
Sheryl Sandberg
So we don't break out our business by marketer segment and we don't give margins by marketer segment. But to help answer you question, we have seeing strong growth across all of our marketer segment. All of them are growing brands, growing direct response and E-commerce are growing, F&B and local businesses are growing, developers are growing.
We definitely think there is a big opportunity for those to grow same-store sales of our large clients, particularly with the shift that's happening from TV to digital and mobile. We think that there is a really exciting opportunity. We also think SMBs are a big opportunity for us and certainly in an advertiser base of over a million advertisers, the great majority of that is obviously the small to medium sized businesses.
We worked hard on our sales efforts, so that we have the right sales and support effort to meet our clients. We care about our margins. We certainly have simplified products such as we have rolled out over the last year, make it easier and cheaper for SMBs to use our products. Easier for them and cheaper for us. And we will continue to focus on the automated tools that help.
I think the most important thing we have done on this goes back to an earlier question about focusing on marketer objective. Before we were asking marketers to come in and choose what ad products they were buying. With our shift to focusing on marketer objectives, it's easier for everyone from largest to the smallest. You know, a small business owner can come in and say, I want my app install or I want web conversions or I want web clicks and then we are doing the harder work of figuring out what products are there, figuring out which of those ads should have digital content, so that we can meet those objectives
I think that move of moving more towards using their language and focusing on their business needs is a simpler product for them. It will help gain us more marketers and it helps us work with them in a more efficient way.

Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks, Deborah and thanks everyone for joining us today. We made some really good progress this quarter with the growth of – in the growth and engagement of our community, the release of new products like Instagram video and advertising growth, especially on mobile.
When it comes to mobile, I’m very pleased with the results. We now have more daily actives on mobile than on desktop. Nearly half a billion people use Facebook on their phones everyday and soon we’ll have more revenue on mobile than on desktop as well. This progress is the result of investments we started making more than a year-ago and in some cases years ago.
I appreciate the patience and trust of our team, our community, and our investors have given us and we’re looking forward to seeing other long-term investments and achieved great results as well.
One of the questions I frequently get asked are what are the big changes we want to make in the world over the next 5 or 12 years? Now that we’ve connected a 1 billion people, what is the next big ambition? There are three main goals I would like us to achieve. Connect everyone, understand the world and help build the knowledge economy.
Connecting everyone is about growing our community to reach the next 5 billion people. Our mission is to give all people the power to share and make your world more open and connected. And that means everyone. Not just product in developed countries. Most people in the world, they only had the smartphones or data access, but we know that we want to be connected.
We are focused on making this possible, while also strengthening engagement within our existing community. Understanding the world is that helping people share not just day-to-day updates like text messages and photos, but also building up long-term knowledge about the world. But what people are interested in, which restaurants are good, which hotels your friend’s have stayed out and so on.
We should be able to build intelligent services that help you use your network that could answer lots of questions for you to note if service can. I want to read our community to create a graph of all that understanding to power this intelligence.
Building the knowledge economy is about helping people create companies and jobs, using information. The way I see our advertising product, we’re just building a strong monetization engine for our Company. We are creating tools to enable new growth jobs and businesses, [indiscernible] (2 2:24) Platform to support a larger economic shift in the world based on knowledge and information.
I’m proud of the work we’re doing here to help developers create apps to help local businesses, find customers, to help great brand tell their stories and this is the core part of our mission. Now let’s talk about the progress we’ve made in each of these areas. Starting with connecting everyone. The Facebook community has grown steadily this quarter, adding 45 million new monthly actives and the number of monthly active is steady or increasing across demographics and countries.
One thing that surprised me as we’ve grown is I’ve always expected our ratio of daily actives to monthly actives were decreased as later technology adapters used our service. The opposite is actually been true, but now 61% of monthly actives or daily actives and that ratio has just continued to increase.
In our most penetrated markets like the U.S., more than 70% of our monthly actives use our services daily. And now more than 700 million people worldwide use Facebook daily as of today. As more social services get created, one question is how that affects the sharing and time that people spend on Facebook? You can naively assume that more new services means people spend less time on Facebook, but that isn’t happening. In fact, people on average are spending more time on Facebook than ever before.
It’s possible that because the market is expanding due to mobile, even as time spent per person increases on Facebook, maybe our market share can decrease. But that doesn’t seem to be happening either. So according to third-party metrics like comScore and Nielsen, Facebook share of time spent in the U.S. is either steady or increasing. Now we believe that’s either steady or increasing everywhere else as well.
This makes sense to me because Facebook helps to maintain your real identity in relationship, which are universal need. We believe that if we execute well, we have a good shot at growing the amount of time that people spend using Facebook, while also maintaining or increasing our overall share of time spend.
One specific demographic I want to address is U.S. teens. There has been a lot of speculation reporting that fewer teens are using Facebook. But based on our data, that just isn’t true. It’s difficult to measure this perfectly, since some young people lied of their age. But based on the best data we have, we believe that we’re close to fully penetrated in the U.S. teen demographic for a while and the number of teens using Facebook on both a daily and monthly basis has been steady over the past year and half.
Teems also remain really highly engaged using Facebook. Now it’s also worth mentioning that these stats are for Facebook only. Instagram is growing quickly as well. If you combine the two services together, we believe our engagement and share of time spend are likely growing quickly throughout the world.
Next, let's talk about building more useful services on the path to understanding the world. The newest product I'm most excited about from our last quarter is Instagram video. Adding video fits really naturally with the Instagram mission of capturing and sharing the world's moments. It's off to a great start. People are already uploading hours of video to Instagram every minute. I'm really proud of the team and I think they did a great job with this product.
When I first talked to Kevin about this, he had a really smart insight. Instagram has always been about helping people capture moments in a way they're proud of. Filters were necessary for photos because when Instagram started, most phone cameras weren't good enough to take high quality photos. But lack of filters isn't what's holding back videos from being great. It's that they're shaky and feel unprofessional.
Kevin realized that if we can deliver a product that helps people produce stable videos that would really change the landscape and I think it already is. Now some products that video fit into the flow of what people are doing and they take off quickly. Others like Graph Search and Home are completely new kinds of products and they're just going to take longer to develop.
I've used the right strategy to have a balance of long-term foundational new products in ones that fit in immediate demand. We're committed to building all of these into market-leading products.
Finally, let's talk about building the knowledge economy and what that means for our core business. This quarter has been a strong period for us. A lot of new businesses have signed up to advertise with us and we now have more than 1 million active advertisers. Our News Feed Ad products are working well for them.
One of the things I watch most closely is the quality of our ads and peoples' sentiment around them. Right now ads on average make up about 5% or 1 in 20 stories in News Feed. We haven't measured a meaningful drop in satisfaction when we ask people about their experience with Facebook. We're comparing that to the result we get when we ask the same question to people using a version of Facebook with no feed ads at all.
With that said, in recent studies people have told us that they noticed the ads more, so we're going to invest more in improving the quality. Our top priority is to expand the number of marketers and overall demand in our system rather than just increasing the number of ads that we show. We believe that this will help us improve the quality of the ads that we show by creating a more competitive auction and this will create the best experience for people who use our products, the best returns for more marketers and the best results for us.
So that's my update for this quarter. We had a lot of progress in the last three months on growing our community engagement, releasing a successful major product and generating strong financial results. This quarter also marks the end of our first year as a public company and I think we created a good foundation for the future.
I want to take a moment to thank everyone who works at Facebook and everyone who's a part of this great community. You are all helping to connect the world and push it forward. I'm grateful to have the chance to work with all of you on this. So thank you and thanks to everyone on this call for joining us today. I look forward to having more to share next quarter.
And now, Sheryl.
Sheryl Sandberg
Thank Mark. Our advertising business gained significant momentum this quarter growing 61% year-over-year to 1.6 billion. Our mobile ad revenue grew significantly as well and is now approximately 41% of total ad revenue, up from about 30% in Q1. This growth was robust across all regions and each of our four marketing segments increased spending about this quarter. We believe this is because our ad products are delivering impressive ROI for each of these types of marketers.
Direct response marketers, including ecommerce companies, increased their spent significantly. Year-over-year ad revenue from ecommerce companies doubled in the second quarter. Direct response marketers are taking advantage of our high click-through rates and competitive CTCs to grow their businesses. These marketers are typically very measurement focused and they quickly increased their budgets as we deliver compelling ROI.
Revenue from mobile app install ads also continues to accelerate. The app market is relatively new but it is already large and growing very rapidly. We believe that Facebook is one of the most effective ways for developers to acquire new customers at competitive rates. We're increasing our share and helping to grow this market.
Local businesses also grew spend significantly. We surpassed 1 million active advertisers this quarter, more than double the number we had only a year ago. We believe that this rapid growth is being driven by our unique ability to target ads and the simpler ad products we rolled out in the past year.
We're all really excited that we can help local businesses grow around the world. One of my favorite local examples is right in our backyard, Artisan State, a San Francisco business that prints photo books. The owner told us that running News Feed ads gave him so many customers so quickly that they had to pause their campaigns to let their manufacturing catch up.
Nearly 18 million local businesses now have Facebook pages, but we are excited to hit 1 million active advertisers, we know that this is just a small fraction of the local businesses on Facebook. So this remains a large growth opportunity for us.
And finally, brand marketers also continue to grow spend. We have a massive and engaged audience around the world that brands can use to build awareness and drive scales. Every night 88 million to 100 million people are actively using Facebook during primetime TV hours in United States alone.
One recent example is from Reckitt Benckiser, a global CGP company. Their campaign for Lysol targeted moms and drove a two times return on ad spent for their brand. Their campaign for Air Wick was even better driving a 5x return on ad spent. As they have seen these results, they have more than doubled their ad spent with us over the last year.
News Feed ads are performing very well. In an analysis by Datalogix of 55 ad campaigns on Facebook over the past six months, marketers saw a median return on ad sales of three times of campaigns that did not include adding new feeds, which is very solid performance. Campaigns that included News Feed ads, the median return on ad sales was nearly double at 5.9x.
During the second quarter we increased the number and type of ads in News Feed. At the same time, our click-though rates and cost-per-click metrics for News Feed ads remains strong during the quarter providing a good indicator of healthy and growing advertiser demand and continued user interest in these ads.
Custom Audiences is another key product that continues to gain momentum. This product enables our clients to enhance their ad targeting by marrying their data with ours in a privacy protective way. In Q2 the number of marketers using custom audiences more than doubled relative to Q1.
We also continue to innovate around our mobile app products. In April we launched ad targeting for future trends. This helps marketers, everyone from multinationals to local businesses, reach people in emerging markets who they could not easily reach before. While these ad markets are not especially large today, they'll become increasingly important in the years to come.
In summary, we believe we're making strong progress executing our strategy. As I have mentioned in previous quarters, we are investing in mobile measurements and product innovations. The results we are reporting today demonstrate the early returns on these investments. Looking ahead, we're enthusiastic about the launch and prospects for our business.
The time people are spending on mobile devices is increasing dramatically that mobile represents just 2% of ad spent globally and 3% in the U.S. We have a massive and growing mobile user base. We have an impressive share of mobile time spent and we have one if not the most effective mobile app products. Together this positions us well to lead the mobile app market.
We believe that over time, marketers will increasingly rely on Facebook not just to reach people wherever they are but to fundamentally transform the way they build their businesses. As Facebook delivers personalized experiences to over 1.1 billion people, we also have a unique opportunity to deliver a more personalized advertising experience.
As I meet with marketers all around the world, I find more and more that they are understanding the benefits of this opportunity. As a result, Facebook is placed to play an essential role in the evolution of marketing. We know we still have a lot of hard work to do, but we're excited about this quarter and the opportunity in front of us.
Now David.
David Ebersman
Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'd like to update you on our progress in Q2 against our key financial objectives. Increasing revenue, investing to drive our future growth and positioning the company to maximize long-term returns for our shareholders. It was a great quarter across the board as we continue to benefit from and effectively navigate the transition to mobile.
Let's start with our network. Usage and engagement on Facebook remain extremely strong as evidenced by the following. On an average day in June, 699 million people used Facebook, up 27% from last year. This represents 61% of the 1.15 billion people who accessed Facebook at any point during the month of June.
Additionally, time spent per person on Facebook continues to increase. An aggregate across everyone in our network, time spent on Facebook exceeded 20 billion minutes each day in June.
Separately, Instagram continues to grow rapidly with impressive engagement and we announced last month we had over 130 million actives using the service. Overall we’re really pleased by the unprecedented growth in engagement of our community at this scale. Now let’s turn to the financials.
In Q2, total revenue was $1.81 billion up 53% or 54% when adjusted for constant exchange rates. Ad revenue was $1.6 billion up 61% in the quarter or 63% when adjusted for constant exchange rates. This was our strongest quarter in terms of advertising revenue growth since the third quarter of 2011. The performance was strong throughout the world with ad revenue in each of our geographic regions growing by greater than 15%.
Growth in advertising revenue was driven by an increase in the number of marketers, overall advertising demand and the strong performance of newsfeed ads. Newsfeed ads were, they have been remarkably effective at delivering high levels of engagement a significant increase in click through rates and overall number of clicks and marketers have increased budgets meaningfully in response. Overall ad impressions were up 43% and the average price per ad was up 13% compared to last year.
Ad impressions are up due to more people using our service worldwide combined with the impact of reducing the price floor late in 2012 which resulted in more ads being shown particularly in developing markets. In the U.S. and Canada where the price floor changes had a smaller impact, ad volume increased 6% and average price per ad increased over 40% year-over-year driven by the growth higher performing newsfeed ads.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $214 million in Q2, an increase of 11% versus last year. Payments revenue from games specifically was up 7% so we believe 11% represents the best apples-to-apples comparison if we adjust for items such as the change in revenue recognition timing we made late last year. We were pleased to see Kings continued rapid growth on our games platform in Q2.
Kings strategy of launching games like Candy Crush Saga on Facebook and subsequently launching on mobile has proved to be an effective approach that enables people to seamlessly play games across desktop and mobile and we expect other game developers to pursue a similar strategy. We believe Facebook continues to offer a compelling platform for developers to build great games and businesses.
Overall ARPU increased 25% compared to last year to $1.60 per user for the quarter including a 35% increase in the United States and Canada as well as 30 plus percent gains in all our other regions.
Turning now to expenses, in Q2 our GAAP total expenses were $1.25 billion, excluding stock compensation non-GAAP total expenses increased 52% to $1.02 billion primarily driven by headcount and infrastructure. We ended the quarter just shy of 5,300 employees up 33% from last year and we continue to be pleased with our success in attracting talent.
Our Q2, GAAP operating income was $562 million representing 31% operating margin. Excluding stock comp our non-GAAP operating income was $794 million up 44% non-GAAP operating margin. Our GAAP tax rate for Q2 was 39% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 37%. GAAP net income was $333 million or $0.13 per share and non-GAAP net income was $488 million or $0.19 per share.
We spent $268 million on CapEx in Q2, as we continue to invest in our datacenters and facilities. While the relatively lower spend on CapEx in Q2 is partially the result of timing of purchases. It also reflects the returns from a significant effort by employees throughout the company to make our software and hardware more efficient. CapEx will remain one of our primary areas of spend since we need a powerful infrastructure to provide content rich and personalized information to all the people who use our service around the world.
The projects like Open Compute and many others are providing great returns for us and helping ensure we’re able to invest our resources in a disciplined and efficient manner. Of note, free cash flow in Q2 was over $1 billion. This is much higher than we expect in coming quarters as Q2 free cash flow benefited from $419 million tax refund and light quarterly spend on CapEx. But still $1 billion in free cash flow is a nice milestone for us against an important financial metric.
In Q2 similar to prior quarters, upon the vesting of employee RSUs, we withheld shares and paid the associated income taxes for our employees, with provides an outcome similar to Facebook having repurchased approximately $153 million worth of shares in the quarter. We ended Q2 with $10.3 billion in cash and investments.
Now I want to conclude by sharing some thoughts about the second half of 2013. We expect newsfeed ads to remain the main driver of revenue growth in the second half of the year and we believe we have a great opportunity to continue to drive long-term growth by improving the quality and relevance of these ads. However remember that newsfeed ads really began to contribute to our revenue in the third and fourth quarters last year which will make for more difficult year-over-year comparisons in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2.
Looking at expenses, consistent with what we said previously we plan to invest in our business and continue to expect that our total non-GAAP expenses including cost of revenue but excluding stock comp will likely grow in the neighborhood of 50% for the full-year 2013 compared to 2012. We also continue to expect that this full-year over full-year expense growth rate will be faster than our year-over-year revenue growth rate for the full-year 2013 compared to 2012.
In terms of our tax rate, we expect that our Q3 and full-year non-GAAP tax rate with be a few percentage points higher than our Q2 rate and finally we expect 2013 CapEx to be in the neighborhood of $1.6 billion. This is down from our prior estimate of $1.8 billion due to a combination of efficiency gains and changes in timing of purchases while Q2 was a very strong quarter for us.
We believe we’re executing well in particular with regard to the mobile transition, the investments we have been making over the past year are paying off, the business is growing rapidly and we’re excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Now let’s open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Great, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the ad revenue growth during the quarter, and it was very helpful to get the four segments broken down but, can you just help us understand a little more on the Sheryl you’re cutting on the increased number and then the types of ads in the newsfeed in 2Q and trying to understand if this is more sort of specific product driven or if this is just the combination of all the efforts that have been going into newsfeed ads essentially over the last year? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
So over the past during these calls we’ve been talking about our three priorities in growing our ads business, mobile, measurement and product innovation. I think what you’re seeing here is all three of these are paying off. Obviously the transition to mobile was a really big one. We had almost no mobile ads a year-ago, were up to 41% this quarter. We have done a lot of measurement and product innovation newsfeed ads has been the most important thing we’ve done now, and we’ve done other things as well. In terms of the marketer segments, all four marketer segments are growing and contributing to our growth. So we’re seeing both the increased supply that we talked about with newsfeed ads, but also the increase in demand that all four of these marketer segments represent.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
And just as a follow-up, can you help us understand how impactful or how big mobile app install ads are within the mix?
Sheryl Sandberg
Yeah, we don’t break out by segment, the four market segments but again all four are growing. Mobile app install ads, we think are -- they’re small but they’re important and they’re growing rapidly. It's basically a totally new market. People who are selling either mobile apps as their revenue or things that are bought through mobile app are looking for a way to find new customers and we represent one of the only ways in a very effective way to do that. So, we’re growing quickly and I think we’re helping to grow this market.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you very much and congratulations. I was wondering you talked about before improved targeting and relevance of newsfeed ads that lies ahead. I was just wondering if you could share with us the progress you think you’ve made on this initiative and kind of what is to come?
Sheryl Sandberg
Targeting is really important, because what takes an ad and makes it a good ad is whether it's relevant to you. When I see something on Facebook or anywhere that I’m interested in that’s a great experience. When I see something that I’m not interested in, that’s not -- and so we have done a lot of work around targeting. The most important work we've done over the past year and I think you're seeing its results and it is around Custom Audiences, which enables people to use their data in a privacy protective way with us. It enables them to show different ads to people who are current customers versus new customers who are interested in different things. And I think we're really pleased with the adoption. The number of marketers using Custom Audiences more than doubled in Q2 and we're now up to 50 of the AdAge 100 who have already started using the products. We also think there is room to improve. We can do more and we will continue to do more to improve the targeting, the relevance of our ads.
Operator
The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Great, thanks. Two questions please. Could you talk about thoughts on monetization of Instagram and maybe just potentially how you think about the ability to monetize that versus your core Facebook asset? And then secondly, Sheryl, could you talk about on the vertical basis where you think the biggest wide space opportunities are for advertising revenue for Facebook and the particular industries that you look at that they are materially underrepresented on Facebook where you could have the greatest growth going forward? Thanks a lot.
Mark Zuckerberg
Sure. I'll answer the Instagram question. Kevin has always been clear that we're building Instagram to be at business and that we expect that over time we're going to generate a lot of profit from it and probably through advertising. Now that all said, right now it's just growing still quickly. I mean the number that we just said was 130 million monthly actives. Video product is growing really quickly. There are so many directions to expand this in that we think that the right focus for now is to continue just focusing on increasing the footprint of Instagram. And when the right time comes then we'll think about doing advertising as well, but I think that's going to be a really big opportunity.
Sheryl Sandberg
In terms of growth opportunities, I think in terms of vertical categories, we have big growth opportunities across the board. There are certainly verticals that were stronger than others which were very strong, for example in CPG. But even though we've grown spend significantly, we're still a tiny portion of the spent that CPG advertises. And even in the verticals where I think we've done very well, starting to penetrate, there's a lot of room for growth. I think as you think about different industries using the power of online marketing, we see different levels of adoption but I'm a believer that over time this is where people are spending their time and any marketer who's trying to reach people is going to spend their resources there as well.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Jordan Rohan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Jordan Rohan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
Thanks so much. I think it's fairly easy too when talking to advertisers to access that there has been this latent demand for advertising on Facebook. But when you look across the globe, it's a little bit harder to address the advertising community. Can you talk about the growth of the ad sales force and the ad ops and all the people required to really bring that outside of the major U.S. and Western European markets? And specifically is there a chance that you believe that Asia-Pacific and rest of world markets can see a meaningful continued and sustainable shift higher in ARPU than where we are today? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
Yes, I'm a big believer that revenue opportunities exist all over the world and our gross was very strong across regions, including outside of the U.S. for this time. We're up to over 40 offices and we have sales teams on the ground in over 40 offices and we're seeing really good adoption and really good growth across. You mentioned Asia, I was actually in Japan and Korea meeting with advertisers just a few weeks ago and we are seeing companies that really weren't doing much with us a year ago increasingly adopt us as part of a core part of their spend. So I remain very optimistic about our growth across Asia and the rest of the world.
Operator
The next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Thank you very much. Two questions please. Can you talk about the mix of growth in direct selling versus programmatic selling for you guys and where do you see that going forward? And in terms of just on the cost side, I guess looking at the investment and by the way David, thanks for the color about operating expenses and guidance for the second half, but as you look at longer term, how far can you see that 50% increase in operating expenses still being sustained as you, I guess just looking at 2014? I know you're not guiding to 2014 right now, but just as we look at the model going forward how far do you think you can sustain growth in operating expenses faster than growth in revenues? Thank you.
David Ebersman
Yeah, thanks for your question. Your first question about direct selling versus programmatic, the mechanism that most people buy from Facebook is through the option that we offer, but that doesn't mean that we're not – we don't have a sales force that's out calling on clients. Sheryl can expand on that if you want.
Sheryl Sandberg
Yeah, we sell both directly to our sales team so it's in-person and online. And what I think you mean by programmatic which is through third party such as DSPs and other – one thing worth noting is that FBX which is part of that programmatic selling is actually a very small part of our business and I think sometimes people don't understand that. So that piece is quite small. We are expanding both our direct selling efforts both to sales teams and online as well as the third parties we work with, and we think having a healthy and growing ecosystem on both sides is really good for the development of our business.
David Ebersman
You asked about investments looking forward to next year, I think philosophically is the easiest way to answer that which is we still think we're early in the journey of building the service that we want Facebook to be and there's lots of work ahead of us to do and lots of things to do. And our plan will continue to be to invest aggressively in the areas that we think are important to improve our strategic positioning and to drive our ability to grow revenues and profits over the long run. We also know that to be the great company that we want to be, we have to be disciplined in everything that we do and focus our spend on the areas that are really most important. So, the challenge for us just by any company is finding that right balance. I really can't comment on 2014 yet honestly just because we haven't – I don't know what 2014 is going to look like. We tend to plan in six-month blocks and I think have our act together pretty well for what we're going to try to do in the second half of this year, but haven't been on the conversation about next year yet.

The next question comes from the line of Anthony Diclemente with Barclays. Your line is open.
Anthony Diclemente - Barclays
Thanks a lot. I have one for Sheryl and one for David. Sheryl, I'd be interested in hearing a little bit about the relative progress of impression-based selling versus performance-based and you mentioned the ecommerce – the doubling from ecommerce from direct response and I guess I just wanted to know if you've increased the amount of inventory that you're selling on an impression basis versus performance? And then David, I had a follow-up on the CapEx. It just seems like an interesting time for CapEx to be coming in when video usage and video uploads could be growing…
Sheryl Sandberg
We may have lost the question, but I'll take the first half while we wait for the second piece to come back. On the first piece, our system works that you can buy by CPM or CPC and we let advertisers choose. I think both parts of our business are healthy and growing. I think when people talk about impression-based purchasing or buying, what they're really trying to get at is brands. And brand is a very important, one of our four segments and one that's growing. When you think about what brand spenders are doing, they're trying to get discovery. And I think we've made a lot of progress there. We now work with every one of the global AdAge 100 over the past year. Now that said, people are in different parts of that spectrum. We have brand advertisers who are looking for discovery who have advertised with us for a long time, proven the value and are really expanding and these others that are newer, that are experimenting that aren't as convinced yet and it's our job to get there and convince them. I think what people are increasingly seeing is we have a big brand opportunity. We have a massive engaged audience, 88 million to 100 million people in the U.S. during primetime hours who are on Facebook. We offer discovery and we have a unique opportunity to take people all the way through the funnel. In one example, a recent one that I really like is T-Mobile did an ad campaign with us to attract people to sell new phones. They used our offer ads to do it. 9% of the people who claimed the offer converted to T-Mobile within 10 days and they had over 20 times return on their ad spend which is just incredibly strong in the industry and I think that shows the power of what we can do with impressions, taking people all the way through the funnel.
David Ebersman
Anthony, I'll try and answer your question about CapEx as best I could. You got cut off as you probably know, so I only got about – well, I don't know how much of it I got but I got enough to give it a shot. And really the best way I can think to answer it is to describe for you the variables that influence what CapEx requirements are for the company. So clearly the number of users is near the top of the list, and also the time at which the users use the service. So adding users who are off peak -- the Facebook peak provides less of a burden for our infrastructure than people who are using at the same time as our peak hours, because we can leverage what we built to peak. A second thing is definitely the level of engagement with those users and that seem to be where you were going with your question about video. That is and will continue to be, we hope something that drives up requirements for our infrastructure because it means people are really engaging and finding new ways to use the service. What has helped us I think is the two variables that come next. One is just the cost of the equipment itself and the datacenters and over time Moore’s Law and other things and competition in the market have helped us to really be able to bring down the cost for each unit of equipment we use. And then the next variable which I mentioned in my remarks which I think is a really important one is just the efficiency of what we build. So over time I think Facebook has impressively succeeded at making the hardware we use more efficient and the software that we run on it more efficient in terms of how much compute power that is needs. The last variable of course probably the hardest to predict is product development, is just what we build and how that influences what the computer requirements are. So clearly the variable you emphasized which was engaging with higher content things is one of the things that will influence the CapEx over time, but it's a pretty complicated equation, but I think right now we’re managing well. I think we’re pleased with how 2013 is coming together in that regard.

The next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. As we look back since mobile ramp back in 3Q last year, it's been pretty lumpy and it bounced around quarter-over-quarter, but it looks like a pretty big inflection this quarter. Can you help us understand why it has been so lumpy, at least we can think about going forward and maybe what caused the inflection this quarter? And then, I really appreciated the Time Spent metric, I think you said 20 billion minutes per day, but can you tell us how that compares to say a quarter ago or a year ago? Thank you.
David Ebersman
So in terms of the progression of mobile, and we’re really pleased overall that on newsfeed ads in general and on mobile in particular are working so well in terms of the performance they’re providing to marketers and how users are engaging with them. For a new product like this, I don’t think we should be that surprised at the sort of quarter-to-quarter progression it's going to be harder to predict than it would be for a more mature product. I think one of the things that happened in the second quarter is that as the investments we’ve made started to really come together. We had a lot more demand in our system that met the quality bar that we set for feed, so we’re able to place that demand intelligently in a manner where it performed well and didn’t have a meaningful impact on the user experience. So I think that more feed eligible demand was a big part of the story. And I think one of the really good pieces of news for us is how well the price held up as we did that, as we increased the number of ads we showed in feed. So for many of our ads as you know marketers are bidding for clicks in an auction and the auction determines the price for supply both demand, the cost per click price. And in the second quarter and this specific, I’m going to give you is relative to the first quarter of this year because it's hard to do a year-over-year for mobile and for newsfeed because it just didn’t really didn’t exit a year-ago. Q2 relative to Q1, the number of clicks in our system went up a lot and we might have assumed that price would decline as click number increased because we’re basically pushing out the supply curve and changing the point where supply would meet demand. And that’s not what happened. Cost per clicks for feed ads increased and really demonstrating to us that demand was growing rapidly as well as we’re increasing the supply of ads we were showing. So it's not a perfect comparison because Q2 is seasonally stronger than Q1, but it's -- I don’t think the seasonality explains the agenda I just provided. And I think that’s a really encouraging metric for us. And your second question was …
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Time spent.
David Ebersman
Time Spent. We just -- unfortunately we don’t have a lot of longitudinal data for Time Spent. It's not something that we had instrumented well going back more deeply in time because it's hard -- well it's hard on every interface and it's particular hard on mobile. We feel pretty good about where we are now in terms of the quality of the instrumentation. It is up on a per user basis. As you would imagine it's not -- it's gone quarter-over-quarter sequentially on a per user basis, it will be growing slowly. On an aggregate basis of course it's benefited from the fact that we have such a nice and consistent increase in the number of daily users of this service.

The next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
Great, thanks guys. David, just the continuation of what you were just talking about, so on the mobile newsfeed ads is the 5% number -- your 5% of stories being at the right number and is that consistent across geo’s. And then is the growth a function of, you just said price is going up sequentially obviously your mobile DAUs are going up or MAUs are going to up sequentially, then you’re probably also seeing improving click through rates. So, of those three variables, users, click through rate and price, which is driving the sequential increase the most in mobile? Thanks.
David Ebersman
So in terms of the 5% number again, what we know is where we are now, and we’re pleased that things are going as well as they are at the current level. So, the number was zero a year ago, it increased steadily over the past year and the 5% number is a average number globally, it does differ by geography and it also differs by person. It will be higher for people for whom we have a lot of more ads that are targeted towards them and are relevant for them, and what we’re trying to do is find the right balance ideally for each user where we’re balancing their experience with Facebook and the performance of the ads and continually tweaking the product, learning from our experience to try and do that as well as we can. Going forward, I think as we have -- I think I’m consistent in saying the biggest opportunity for us is to improve the quality of the ads so that we can show ads that are engaging in relevant for the users involved. Your question about what drove the increase? I think everything contributed. I think that’s one of the things that’s encouraging about where we're, is we do have more users. We have more demand that enabled us to share more newsfeed ads. We’re really pleased with how click through had held up, and I mentioned what was happening in terms of cost per click increasing sequentially. So it's a nice balance contribution from the variables that determine what our revenue performance is.

The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Pitz - Jefferies & Company
Thank you, I wonder if you could give us a sense for what the major hurdles are to overcome before deploying a major video ad product on the core site. As you’re out talking to potential clients, can you help us understand what demand looks like for that product. And then maybe separately just a sense for what you’re seeing in Europe from a macro perspective just given some of the mixed news we heard on the economy over there? Thanks so much.
Sheryl Sandberg
On Video ads, we have a current video ad product, because marketers can embed a video in a page post and we see a lot of marketers using that product and seeing good results as a demand to do more in video on Facebook is there. And we’re exploring how we can expand that, but we don’t have anything new to announce today. In terms of Europe, we heard the same things and obviously on the macro environment, but our growth has been very strong. We had a new Head of our European Operations as well. Nicola Mendelsohn who just started, we’re excited to have her and we’re experiencing a strong growth.

The next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie Research Equities
Congratulations on a really outstanding quarter. Mark I want to ask about the platform strategy and its broadly, how was the strategic vision to allow third-parties to provide services to the network evolved over the past year, and what needs to happen that more of a contribution from non-advertising based businesses?. And David just quickly from modeling, the mobile ad revenue, can you talk about how that progressed through the quarter, did it exit June much stronger than it was earlier in the quarter? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yeah, I mean, I can get the platform question. The strategy for that has – we shifted a bit to focus on building more business tools for developers than a lot of work we’re seeing is folks have shifted towards using products like mobile app installs and originally we were – we had a little bit of skepticism about how happy developers would be with a system where they would pay to get more distribution. But what we’ve actually found is that the NBS is really high for this, because it’s just more stable than anything else that they’ve had. In the past it’s the most stable way that they have to grow their app. So we’re basically focused on doing now is – we think about advertisers in terms of these used cases that folks had on this local businesses. They are great brands. They are developers, who are building app, there is an eCommerce and we’re really focused on building up the platform to be one of those big verticals to be a big part of the business. There is also a games part of the platform, which is kind of the first piece of platform that we launched and that is just continuing to grow at a slower, but steady rate.
David Ebersman
Your second question was about progress through the quarter, nothing notable to report there. It was really a strong quarter from the beginning to the end.

Next, we have a question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley
Thanks. I had a bigger picture question for Mark. I was hoping you could give sort of a scorecard when you're in relative to your founder letter. I know it's been only 14 months and that's a short period of time, but it will be interesting to hear your views on the company's performance against the longer term aspirations and core values that you've put in the letter? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yeah, I think we're early. And one of the interesting things over the past six months or so is reaching 1 billion people was this big rallying cry for the company for a long period of time. And I think as we've passed that, we've seen the ambition that the company has grow. And reaching 1 billion users was a great first thing to focus on because no one had ever built a service that had 1 billion active people who were signed in and had real identity before. But in a way it's actually kind of just an abstract, there's nothing magical about 1 billion. The real goal is to connect everyone in the world and help people map out everything that there is. Well, I think what we're seeing is as some of the products succeed is just the ambition increased to be able to do more of these and taking on more longer term things. At the same time, I think what you have is we weren't happy with the quality of our mobile experiences, rewinding 18 months. So we had just a lot of foundational work to do and I think coming into this year, we kind of could tell internally that we were turning a corner on that. We were in good shape and could start to play a bit more offense. But as I think the numbers from this quarter suggest, I think we're really starting to see the upside of some of the investments that we've been making over the last period.
Operator
The next question comes from Mark May with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Mark May - Citi Investment Research
Thanks for taking my question. I have two. One of the things that stood out in your prepared remarks is I think you mentioned 40% year-on-year increase in average price per ad in North America in Q2. I was hoping you could remind us how that compared to say Q1 and given that I think you contributed that to higher performing ads, if maybe you could call out specifically what one or two either ad units or ad targeting enhancements were the kind of key contributors to that growth? And then secondly, David, I think you called out the more challenging comps as you enter into the second half of the year. Are you suggesting that it's kind of unreasonable for us to look at the sequential growth that you saw in the second half of 2012 and assume that that sort of rate of growth is repeatable this year?
David Ebersman
Okay. In terms of pricing I think – we were pleased with the pricing growth in the first quarter too. The net across the world was a 3% average in the first quarter but that was much higher in the U.S. and Canada, because again for the same reason it wasn't impacted by the price floor change. So it was about 25% in the U.S. and Canada and was even stronger in the second quarter. And similarly in other territories, I think pricing is just going really well and would be stronger than the result show if not for the impact of the price floor. We probably have numbers that are similar to the U.S. and Canada, if not stronger in our other regions as well. In terms of the comps, I don't think there is anything particularly complicated so what I was saying, it's just if you're looking at the percentage growth rates for Q2, you're comparing to a quarter last year that really didn't have much mobile revenue or News Feed revenue in it at all and that really started to ramp up in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So it's there in one side of the comparison going forward.
Sheryl Sandberg
In terms of where the growth is coming from in terms of ad units, in terms of our market segments direct response marketers are a very big contributor to the growth. That's why I started with them in the remarks and in the Q&A. Ecommerce doubled year-over-year and they're doing that by using a bunch of our different ad products; everything from post to offers to other things, but it's really about looking for those contributions. We've also seen a lot of growth, as I said, in mobile app install ads; small market but growing rapidly and it's a market where we offer a product that there is almost nowhere else to get the kind of returns and opportunity we offer.
David Ebersman
I'm just going to add one more thing just in case I, in anyway, created any confusion and I have no evidence that I did yet. But the price per ad that I was talking about in this question reflects not the same thing as the cost-per-clicks that I answered in a question earlier because price per ad will also incorporate the click-through rate as well as the cost-per-click for click-based ad and also includes ads that are purchased on an impression basis. So most of the pricing metrics we provide are per ad inclusive of click-through rates and impression-based ads. The CPC metric I gave earlier was just, I think, a specific and useful metric in understanding how much strong demand contributed in the second quarter.

The next question comes from Ken Sena with Evercore Partners. Your line is open.
Kenneth Sena - Evercore Partners
Hi. So just maybe if we could drill into the comment around ecommerce spending doubling and it seems as though FBX and third party effort, its growing fast but its small and the same with the app install effort. But can you talk a little bit about what drove that doubling in Europe year-on-year? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
I think direct response marketers have had more opportunities to use our system, use our product and we've also made a very major investment in helping them measure returns and helping them connect what's happening both online and as well as throughout the system. So direct response marketers tend to be buyers when they have an ROI metric. They're looking for that ROI metric and their budgets are flexible around those ROIs. So as they've invested with us and hit their ROI metrics, their budgets go up and they make those adjustments very quickly. That's why when they start using the products and see the value they create, they are able to grow very quickly even within a quarter or within a week or within a month because they adjusted their budgets.

Your next question comes from Rory Maher with Hillside Partners. Your line is open.
Rory Maher - Hillside Partners
Thanks. A couple of quick questions. First on hiring, there's been a lot of discussion in the press about tech companies' need for more highly skilled workers and I'm curious if you're feeling pressure to find that kind of highly skilled talent and what areas you find hardest to fill and maybe some successfully that you're finding good engineering talent? And then secondly on the advertiser mix, have you guys discussed your mix of brand advertisers by category like auto, retail, telecom, that kind of category mix? And are there any that have grown particularly well the past year?
Mark Zuckerberg
Yeah, I can take this. Hiring great people especially engineers is one of the biggest challenges that any technology company has. We're doing really well against the hiring goals that we have. But I mean there was a systemic issue where our country doesn't produce the volume of engineers that the companies would want to hire. And I think that that's a lot of what you hear these companies talking about. We're doing really well competitively right now. We have a really strong program on colleges where we can continue to attract a lot of best people who are graduating. We do really well at hiring senior engineers from across the valley as well. But it's just something that we invest a huge amount of time and it's really important.
Sheryl Sandberg
In terms of where we're growing by category; I've mentioned CPG, gaming, retail, these are vertical categories where we're strong. But again we're growing. We're growing; we're watching people really experiment. One of the things that's been really fun to see even though it's not a pay product is GE is Instagram work. GE is doing super interesting photos on Instagram which show us that other industries are also going to adapt to the social environment and to some of the new ways to reach customers globally.

The next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Laura Martin - Needham & Company
Hi, there. Great numbers, you guys. Congratulations. Two questions. One on, could you guys clarify the custom advertising bucket? I know you said it was up 100% year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter and a lot of the brands are talking about this as a key growth area. So I'm really interested in how big it's starting for you guys? And then my second question is we're also talking to a lot of companies that target your metrics using UTI integrations and would that create an arbitrage I'm wondering if over time you foresee that being a stable ecosystem or are you guys going to try to ease those guys out over time and grab some of that upside that these arbitragers that are using our platform are garnering today? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg
On the first, Custom Audiences is small but growing and important. We doubled what I said as we doubled the number of marketers using the product Q2 over Q1, and that also has included getting us to 50 of the AdAge 100. As I've talked about as a large brand advertisers the AdAge from 100 have a long sales cycle and it takes a lot of work that happened to adapt products and so seeing adoption this quickly of something, we think shows how powerful that targeting is. In terms of some of the more programmatic ways people buy, we think it’s really healthy for us to have multiple sales channels. We like having a direct sales channel, which we have in our 40 – over 40 offices. We like having online and robust sales, because that means that even in countries where we’ve done half offices, we have the ability to sell into those markets. We also like having an eager system of what we call PMDs, third-party sellers who can work with our clients to provide some of the kind of features that we don’t have or some of the kind of capability that they may not have in house. And so for us, we’d like to see all of our sales channels continue to grow and thrive.

The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric Sheridan - UBS
Thanks, guys. Congratulations on the numbers. Mark, longer term question focused on your initial comments, how have some of the recent products that are consumer facing that you guys have launched like Graph Search and Facebook Home sort of taught you what the consumer acceptance is for certain things, learnings about how the platform can be developed and evolved over time, would love to get your takeaways on that?
Mark Zuckerberg
Yeah. Well, I mean I think that there are bunch of different kinds of products that you can ship. I mean everyday we ship a lot of tweaks to the products, or small changes to existing products. Then there are going be to products like Instagram video, which is really doing well and it fits very naturally into the current flow of how people use Instagram to capture moments that they’re proud of. So that makes sense. I think the team did a really good job there. The thing is like Home and Graph Search are really new used cases. I mean in the case of Home, it’s a new category of product that’s different from anything that exist out there and I think of its more a seed that we’re planting that its going to create completely new pillar of the ecosystem rather than drafting off behavior that people already have in the system today. So, I definitely think that we just have to look at this over the long-term. And it’s very – when we’re building models for the Company and we basically think that it’s going to be something that we will invest in for years. And we expect these to become marketing – market leading products and they’re doing things that no-one else really has, the strategic position or content to be able to build these products. So we’re excited about them. There is going to be longer term back. So I think if you wan to look at the different things that we’re doing in terms of how naturally they fit into the flow of a person’s day to day life today to get a sense of how quickly it’s going to ramp up over time.

Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks Deborah and thanks everyone for joining us today. We got off to a good start this year with strong engagements and growth across the community, several major new product announcements and some good financial results. Sometimes it surprises me that our community can still grow so quickly beyond a billion active members. More than 100 million new monthly active members have joined in the last half of the year, and now there are more than 650 million people who use Facebook every day. It's more than 60% of our community every day. We continue to see high levels of engagement globally across our whole community. We take our stewardship of this very seriously. We want to make sure we give every person in the world the power to share and we are proud of these results.
Overall, there are three main parts of our strategy. Build the best mobile product, build a platform with new services that leverage the social graph, and build a strong monetization engine. I am going to use my time here with you today to give my assessment of how I think we are doing in each of these areas. Let's start with mobile. One of the products I am most excited about is Facebook Home. It's a family of apps that you can install in your Android phone to make the whole experience of your phone much more personal and about people and not apps.
We know that people spend an average of 20% or more of their time in apps on Facebook. Staying up to date with the people they care about, are doing. We use to open the Facebook app maybe 10 to 15 times per day. But we probably check our phones over a hundred times a day. So with Home, you can see fresh news and content from people and topics you care about every time you turn on your screen. It really brings your phone to life and provides with a completely new experience.
This product is still very early and this is just a first release in a long journey. We are planning on iterating quickly and tuning things based on feedback. We haven’t really started encouraging people to install it from within app yet, and it's only available on a few phones. But over the next few months we hope to push this out much more broadly and get this in the hands of a lot more people. We are excited about Home because we think it's a great product.
But Home is also an important milestone for our company. This is completely new kind of mobile experience based on people, not apps. And we think this is how phones and computers should work. I am looking forward to sharing more with you on the experiences that are brought on mobile that we are building over the rest of this year. Now beyond Home, I am really proud of how Instagram is doing. Kevin and his team have made amazing progress since last April.
When we agreed to acquire them, the Instagram community had 22 million people actively using their service every month. And today over 100 million people are using Instagram each month. The Instagram community is growing even faster than the Facebook community did when it was this size. And the two communities complement each other to create some great experiences where you can capture any moment in your life and easily share across all the communities you care about.
Now I would like to talk about platform and building new services using a social graph. A couple of months ago we announced a new, richer and simpler design for our News Feed that’s more visual and engaging for all the content that you might want to (inaudible). From new stories from the New York Times to pins from Pinterest, or activities from a game that you played. This new design opens up a nicer canvas for content for every developer and publisher out there. And we think it's going to create a lot more opportunities for engagement.
Early feedback has been positive on the versions we have rolled out on iPhone, iPad and desktop web, and we are looking forward to rolling this out more widely since. For our development platform, we have had a long roadmap to build the tools for iOS and Android to make building social app and advertising with Facebook as easy on mobile as it is on desktop web. We conceded this transition by bringing open bringing Open Graph to mobile this month. And our efforts are paying off with now 81 of the top 100 growth in iOS apps and 70 of the top 100 Android apps integrating with Facebook and continuing to grow.
One of the developments that’s been interesting is seeing how big of an opportunity mobile apps can be for Facebook. Because of the rules Apple and Google have in this space with their app stores, it wasn’t this clear earlier on what kind of a role Facebook can play. But I think it's clear now that we can create a lot of value for developers by providing a platform for identity and distribution. We are starting to see real revenue through selling mobile apps themselves. We just announced the acquisition of Parse, a platform of service provider for mobile apps as part of our strategy to provide greater support for developers. Both of these products make it easier for developers to create and grow their apps and this could be the start of something much bigger.
Now I want to talk a bit about monetization. I just mentioned mobile apps install ads, which are growing quite well and it becomes one of our most important new ad product. This supports our hypothesis that Facebook should help you discover new apps and content that you may want to use. And even it is not every recommendation we make is one that you take. I think this is still starting to provide some really good content for our community and I guess into the business opportunity here.
This type of ads makes sense to me on mobile. On desktop web, most ads encourage you to visit a new website. On mobile, it makes sense that most ads encourage you to visit apps instead. And in order to visit apps you first need to install. So these ads are the obvious first step. On mobile, the set of companies that produce apps is much broader than what you might think of as traditional developer. Every major brand, company or service wants to build apps as a storefront or interface for their customers and each of these companies wants to reach their customers to encourage them to install their apps. This market is already big and I expect it to continue to grow quickly.
One more thing that’s important to reinforce here is that we continue to measure people’s satisfaction with all the content they see on Facebook, including ads. We haven’t seen any meaningful impact on the satisfaction and we’re continuing to watch this very closely. This is important to us as stewards of this community. We aspire to have ads -- to show ads that improve the content experience over time. If we continue making progress on this then one day we can get there.
So that’s my update on our strategy for this quarter. We’ve already accomplished a lot so far this year. We’ve seen strong growth in engagement across our whole community, several major product announcements and good financial results. We think the products like Home and Graph Search are big opportunities to deliver some unique and important services to the world that we’re positioned to do better than anyone else. But these services are also big, long term investments. So I want to be clear upfront that we’re making these big investments because I think these are important areas for us to focus on.
Now finally, I want to take a moment to thank everyone who works at Facebook and everyone who makes this community great. All of you are contributing in building these new experiences and helping more than a billion people stay connected. So thank you all and thanks to everyone on this call for being with us today. I look forward to having more to share and report on next quarter.
And now I’d like to turn the call over to Sheryl.
Sheryl Sandberg
Thanks Mark. As Mark said, we had a very solid start to this year and we’re excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Our first quarter total revenue was $1.458 billion and total advertising revenue grew to $1.245 billion. This means that ad revenue was up 43% year over year, faster growth than we’ve had in any quarter in 2012. We believe that this shows that our ad products innovations are helping marketers to reach customers effectively. Our growth is particularly strong from new small and medium sized marketers, direct response marketers and app developers.
I will use my time with you today to update you on the progress we’ve made in our three strategic ads priorities, mobile, measurements and product innovation. First mobile. As Mark just said, having billions of people carry social devices in their pockets, checking them multiple times a day, often checking Facebook is a huge opportunity for us. A recent comScore report showed that in the U.S, people spend more time on Facebook than on any other app on their smartphones. The opportunity for us to connect people to each other and to marketers has never been greater. We are uniquely positioned to offer marketers massive reach on a daily basis.
In Q1, mobile was approximately 30% of our ad revenue, up from about 23% in Q4. Importantly, we’re seeing strong growth in our mobile ads business all around the world, particularly in Asia. As an example, our mobile app install adds performed very well this quarter. We offer developers unique opportunities to drive downloads of their mobile apps as Mark talked about.
During the quarter, 3,800 developers used these ads to drive nearly 25 million downloads. Of the top 100 grossing apps from both iOS and Android in the last week of Q1, about 40% of them used our mobile app install ads. In gaming, travel, e-commerce and financial service industry, the early indicators are that our cost per install are highly competitive. In one example, British Telecom provider O2 used Facebook as its only digital marketing channel to promote its new music app, O2 Tracks. In just three days, they reached 9 million people and got to sixth place in iOS apps in music.
Second, I want to discuss our progress in measurements. One of the challenges we face is helping marketers understand the value of our ads. This has been a major focus for us over the past several quarters. We’re partnering closely with our clients to help them understand how their campaigns are performing and this measurement work also helps them gain a better understanding of their customers which then makes their future campaigns even better. In the last nine months, we’ve conducted campaign effectiveness studies on over 100 campaigns across CPG, auto, retail and telco. One of these studies was Bud Light. Bud Light ran Page Post ads to its 5.8 million fans on Facebook and these ads appeared in all of our placements, including mobile newsfeeds. We worked with DataLogix and found that these ads reached 20% of U.S. households and had 3.3% sales lift, yielding a six times return on ad spend. A result, we are very proud of and Bud Light is really excited about. We plan to continue to invest heavily in (inaudible) with our clients throughout the upcoming year. We are also really excited about our acquisition of Atlas, which closed just last week and I was able to welcome the team to Facebook earlier today.
Atlas is a really important part of continuing to develop our measurement capabilities. For the past decade, digital marketers have primarily measured success by focusing only on clicks. But this over simplifies how people make purchase decisions, both offline and online because it ignores everything people do and see before they do that last press. Smart marketers are looking for a better way to value all of the impressions that they buy and engage thus leading up to purchase.
Multiple industry-wide spendings have validated this multi-click attribution approach. For offline sales, both Nielsen and comScore have repeatedly shown that clicks are not a good predictor of sales lift. For online sales, Aggregate Knowledge found in an analysis of more than 500 online campaigns that when clients moved from allocating their advertising spend using last touch attribution to using multi-touch attribution, they saw a 33% increase in actions, conversions in sales. In a study of campaigns from Q4 2012, they found that when measured holistically, costs per acquisition on Facebook is 68% less than other online channels. The DataLogix study validates this finding as well, demonstrating that on average 99% of people who saw Facebook ads and then bought a product in a store never clicked on an ad at all.
We believe the Atlas platform will help us demonstrate even more clearly the connection between ad impressions and purchases. We could help marketers measure the effectiveness of their ad impressions better not just on Facebook, but across the entire internet. This means we can take the advancements we have made in measurements on Facebook, including our integrations with Nielsen and Datalogix, and expand them to a much larger audience and to many more purchases.
Third, I would like to highlight product innovation in ads. Over the last year we have invested heavily in product innovation and I am excited about what we have accomplished at a relatively short period of time. As always, our top focus is on the results we generate for the marketers, and we are pleased to see the ROI we can provide as well as providing a good experience for our users. We continue to innovate new targeting capability that make it easier for businesses of all sizes to reach the right people, both on desktop and on mobile.
In Q1, we gained traction with our Custom Audiences product. This product allows marketers to reach their target audiences based on their own customer databases or databases maintained by third party. For example, a marketer can target ads to customer who have not returned to their store in the past month but do have made purchases before. This product improves their targeting and generates higher ROI for the marketers and a better ad experience for our users. We are really pleased with the adoption of this product.
In Q1, more than twice as many marketers used Custom Audiences than in Q4, including, 23 of the Ad Age 100 top global marketers and many other important clients. Companies from Hotels.com to Intuit, to Virgin America are seeing success with this product. In April, we launched another powerful targeted product, Partner Categories. This enables marketers to use third party data from Acxiom, Epsilon and other data providers to target their ads. For example, we can deliver ads to the 12 million people in the U.S. who are likely to purchase a car in the next six months, or to the 19 million people who are active purchasers of hair care products, households that purchase hair care products at multiples with other households, or to the 23 million people in the U.S. who are heavy soda drinkers, we apologize, Mayor Bloomberg.
We have also seen more customers begin to use FBX. And we recently launched FBX in News Feed on desktop. We think this will continue to drive the advertiser's options, given that we generally see higher engagement for ads in News Feed. In the last six months of 2012, as one example, re-targeting platform AdRoll saw a 70% lower cost per click on Facebook and on traditional web targeting. FBX was so successful for them that by the beginning of Q1, AdRoll reallocated 63% of their total impressions to Facebook.
Overall, we feel really good about our first quarter results. We've made tremendous strides in mobile. We continue to improve our measurement capabilities, most notably with our acquisition of Atlas and we continue to innovate on our key advertising products and tools. We’re still in the early days of developing our adds business and huge opportunities ahead of us. And we thank all of you for your continued interest in our business.
Thank you. Now I’ll turn it over to David.
David Ebersman
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. I’d like to share with you the progress we made in Q1 against our key financial objectives to increase revenue, to invest aggressively to drive our future growth and to position the company to maximize long term returns for our investors. In March on average 665 million people access Facebook each day, up 26% from last year and representing 60% of the 1.11 billion people who used Facebook during the month.
Consistent with last quarter, mobile continues to drive growth and visitation and engagement. 751 million people accessed Facebook from mobile devices in March, up 54% from last year. These numbers do not include Instagram, which continues to grow rapidly as Mark mentioned.
Turning to revenue, in Q1 total revenue was up 38% and ad revenue was up 43% compared to last year, driven by the strong performance of newsfeed ads. Exchange rates had no meaningful impact on our revenue growth rates. Ad impressions were up 39% and average price per ad was up 3% compared to last year. The product changes we made and discussed last quarter, primarily lowering the price floor in our option had a significant impact on the price and volume year over year comparisons. In the United States and Canada, where the price floor changes had a smaller effect, average price per ad increased over 25% relative to Q1 of last year, driven by a higher engagement and performance of News feed ads.
Mobile ad revenue came in at approximately 30% of ad revenue this quarter versus zero last year and desktop ad revenue in Q1 was essentially flat with last year. As we’ve discussed in the past, most of our advertising clients do not specify that their Facebook ads be shown on desktop only or on mobile only, or rather they put their ads into our system and allow us to show the ads on whatever device where the ads will perform best. Because of this, the flat desktop revenue does not reflect a particular trend relative to desktop demand so much as it reflects the fact that more of our valuable ad inventory is being shown on mobile because that’s where people are spending increasing amounts of time and because the mobile ads perform well.
We believe our aggregate ad revenue number remains the most important reflection of our performance in terms of increasing overall advertising demand. And the most important ways for us to continue to increase ad revenue are to grow users and engagements and to build advertising products and measurement tools that increase demand from advertisers of all types around the world.
Total payments and other fees revenues was $213 million in Q1, an increase of 15% versus last year. payments revenues from games was up 12%, though we believe 6% represents the best apples to apples comparison in terms of the increase for payments from games if we adjust for items such as the Q4 change in revenue recognition timing. We’re pleased that Q1 represented our largest three months quarter of games revenue to date despite a 37% drop in year over year payments volume from our largest developers as our other developers increased their payments volumes by almost 60% and we saw a record number of people playing games on Facebook.
Games revenue in Q1 benefited from the growth of games launched over the past year and also from our efforts to increase games distribution, usage and payments conversion. We believe Facebook continues to offer a compelling platform for developers to build great games and businesses and we will continue to invest in this area. Overall, ARPU increased 12% to $1.35 for the quarter, including a 21% increase in the United States and Canada and double digit gains in the other major regions as well.
Shifting now to expenses, in Q1 our total GAAP expenses were $1.08 billion. Excluding stock compensation, total expenses increased 56% to $895 million, driven primarily by headcount and infrastructure spend to support our growth. We continue to expect that our total non-GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock comp, will likely grow in the neighborhood of 50% in 2013 consistent with what we said last quarter as we continue to invest in products to grow engagements and monetization.
Our Q1 GAAP operating income was $373 million, representing a 26% operating margin. Excluding stock comp, our non-GAAP operating income was $563 million, representing a 39% non-GAAP operating margin. Our GAAP tax rate for Q1 was 38% and benefitted significantly from the realization of the onetime $94 million R&D tax credit in the quarter. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 43% and we expect that our full year non-GAAP tax rate will be similar to Q1.
GAAP net income and EPS for the quarter were $219 million or $0.09 per share and non-GAAP net income and EPS were $312 million or $0.12 per share. We spent $327 million on CapEx in Q1 and we continue to expect 2013 CapEx to be in the neighborhood of $1.8 billion as we invest in servers and data centers to rapidly and reliably provide our products to people around the world.
In Q1, similar to Q4, upon the vesting of employee RSUs, we withheld shares and paid the associated income taxes for our employees, which resulted in an outcome that’s functionally very similar to Facebook having repurchased approximately $400 million worth of shares in Q1. We ended Q1 with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. Overall, we believe that 2013 is off to a good start. We are pleased with our financial performance as well as our progress and product development. We are continuing to invest aggressively in new products that we think will drive long-term engagement as well as product and tools to grow our revenues and increase returns for the advertisers and developers working with us.
And we are excited about the opportunity ahead of us to build out the network of people using Facebook and to bring our unique asset in terms of reach, engagement, and identity to our large and important market opportunities. Now let's open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs
Mark, I was wondering, you shared with us the continued success of mobile install ads, I was wondering if you could share with us the other monetization initiative that you have that you are most excited about for 2013. And then my follow up for David would be, if you can share with us qualitatively how CPM trended in the various regions on a year-over-year basis.
Sheryl Sandberg
I will take the first question. In terms of our ads priorities, they are what I mentioned, mobile, measurements and product innovation. We are particularly focused on improving the quality of our ads because we think that is the best way to have a great experience for users on Facebook as well as for marketers. I think if you look at the success of Custom Audiences, Partner Categories, FBX, what you see in that are products all move us towards better targeting, more relevance, better experience for users and for our marketers. And we are going to continue to invest very heavily in making the ad experiences as high return as they can for everyone involved.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yes. I will just emphasize the same point. I mean the things I am most excited about are things that are driving quality. I mean the two big levers for the business are, a, obviously a lot of people spend a lot of time using Facebook to stay connected with all the people around them. And second, that is an opportunity to advertise. But I actually think over the long term, the thing that’s going to drive the business to most is getting the ads to be very high quality. Personalize, good content in there. And a lot of the things that we are doing are aligned with that. So App install, a lot of that stuff is just good content that people are interested and there is no great way to find app stores today to discover a lot of apps on mobile devices.
Similarly, I talked about the News Feed redesign that we are rolling out. And the content in there is much more visual. And we have always had the policy that the advertising content will display in exactly the same way that the consumer content display is. And making it so that people can share a much more visual content. Making that naturally advertisements can now have the same kind of compelling creative as well, which I think will increase the quality of that and overtime increase the effectiveness as well.
David Ebersman
So Heather, in terms of your question about CPMs. Ads revenue grew well across all the geographic regions that we report on. I mentioned the U.S. and Canada growth in CPMs. We saw a similar number, a little bit lower but similar in Asia. For Europe and rest of the world the numbers were much lower. A little a bit above zero in the case of Europe, a little bit below in the case of the rest of the world. The interesting question around this is, what those numbers might have looked like if we hadn’t made changes in the option dynamics and, such as the price floor and obviously we can’t answer that question quantitatively because we don’t have the data. But we feel pretty strongly and pretty confident that prices would have increased substantially more in all of the regions if we hadn’t made those changes.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
Just two questions. Engagement first was up across most of the geographies. We assume that’s primarily driven by mobile, but can you talk about anything else that’s driving up engagement. And then just a follow up on the geographies. So it looked like the U.S. had a normal seasonal downtick sequentially whereas international most of those regions held up sequentially. So can you talk about the difference between sell-through rate in the U.S. in newsfeed versus some of those international markets?
David Ebersman
In terms of growth and engagement geographically, I think you can see from the numbers that growth was strong across all the areas of the world. We continue to add a lot of users in places like India and Brazil. And in engagement trends I think were similarly strong throughout and mobile is clearly a big part of that equation and been very helpful to us in terms of getting more users, more daily users and more engagement from those users. In terms of revenue by geography, I don’t know that there’s a lot to add to what the numbers I’ve already said. Europe looks good in the first quarter after being a little bit softer towards the end of last year and we continue to grow well in Asia and the rest of the world. So I think just pretty consistent performance there.
Operator
The next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Jordan Monahan - Morgan Stanley
It’s Jordan Monahan on for Scott. Just two quick questions. The first is, one of your competitors recently said something to the effect of if you’re building for mobile you’re building for today but not tomorrow, suggesting that tomorrow is a multi-screen world with all sorts of personalized devices. And I’m just curious, what opportunities do you see when you think about tomorrow? Would you agree that screen fragmentation will continue to increase and does moving ads towards newsfeed and away from right hand side help you in that environment? And then the second question is just about engagement. Engagement continue to improve despite more ads which validates your strategy. So every time you launch a new product people get concerned that engagement may actually tick down, but it seems to do the opposite. So are there other ad formats that you’re thinking about that are likely to be complimentary to engagement?
Mark Zuckerberg
All right, I’ll start. I think that the trend of more different form factors I think is somewhat orthogonal from the main trend that we see which is just people sharing more in different ways. And people want to stay connected with their friends and family and all these different folks in their lives and they’re going to use whatever technology they have to enable that, whether that’s desktop computers or laptops or phones or tablets or glasses, like whatever the products are. And I think that there’s going to be good ways for people to be able to consume a social content on all of those. So I think the big question for us is just which platforms do we see growing the quickest? We’re not tooled up as a company right now to make 10 huge investments like that at a time. But we can do a couple. Certainly in tablets are growing very quickly and I think that’s going to be increasingly important. But I think that consuming social content and staying connected with people is such a fundamental human need that that’s going to be important on all of these.
And getting ads in newsfeed was a valuable step in making it so that everywhere where someone is consuming content from Facebook, the business model goes along with that naturally. And those were the early challenges that we had with mobile with ad for the first six or seven years of Facebook we’re just this right hand column and nothing trends like in mobile. But it was fairly easy with some amount of work just to make that transition. We’re there now and now I think whatever the form factor is going forward we’ll be able to deliver advertising content in a proportion that we think is good along with consumer content. For the sentiment stuff, I think what we’re seeing is really positive. It’s better than expectations and we assumed that sentiment and satisfaction might drop some amount. We continue to watch this really carefully because there’s no guarantee that it won’t in the future. But right now what we have seen has made us more confident that we can do more with advertising over time and can ramp that up. Our strategy isn’t to have like a ton of different ad units. We really want to make it so that we are delivering these end-to-end solutions for our customers and only have a small number of simple things, make it easier for advertisers to work with us. We want to deliver that and we are kind of underway on this long road map to execute that.
Operator
The next question comes from Anthony Diclemente with Barclays. Your line is open.
Anthony Diclemente - Barclays
I have one for Sheryl and one for David. Sheryl, you talked about Atlas and the measurement capabilities there. And you phrased it in terms of click-based ads and I am wondering is there also an opportunity for Atlas to improve or standardize measurement for impression based ads. And I guess the spirit of the question more generally, can you just talk about or update us on the potential for impression based ads in terms of increasing as a percentage of the mix versus performance based ads on Facebook. And then, David, question would be, a little bit of a decel in the rate of growth of ARPU in the U.S. I am wondering if there are other things you can call out in the first quarter, be it dollars from large events, TV events like the Super Bowl or other things, other than seasonality. Or maybe you can quantify or comment on the seasonality factor in the U.S. and Canada for the 1Q?
Sheryl Sandberg
So on Atlas you are exactly right. Our focus with Atlas is on impression based ads. And the idea is that, you know historically a lot of ads online which were more based on search, the attribution was always that last click. And as people have looked more holistically at all the ad spending they are doing, what they find is that it's not just the last click that matters but it's all the impressions leading up to that click. Importantly, we also drive sales offline. And offline people aren’t clicking through the purchase at all but they are actually walking into a store. So in some sense there is no last click.
And so our focus with Atlas is to take that technology and enable us to improve our ability to connect ad impressions to purchase behavior both offline and online, and not just on clicks but across different ad purchases people do. So that’s exactly why we made that purchase.
David Ebersman
In terms of ARPU in the U.S. and Canada was up 21% versus last year, so continuing to make good progress there. I really don’t have anything unique to say about seasonality in 2013. We see it from Q4 to Q1 across the years that we have been in an advertising business. And I am sure there are unique things that impact each year but there is nothing that we are aware of that was particularly important in 2013 in that regard.
Operator
The next question comes from Jordan Rohan with Stifel. Your line is open.
Jordan Rohan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
I am curious about how you address markets where it's a little bit harder to sell advertising. Specifically, if I'm calculating correctly, 41% of monthly active users are in the U.S., Canada and Europe, as you defined those geographies in your slides, and that's 74% of the ad revenues. How can the other geographies of the world step up to be an even more meaningful percentage of total revenue? Do you have to add a lot of heads, a lot of sales infrastructure and technology infrastructure that you don't currently have? And from that perspective, did you meet your objectives in terms of hiring and expenses, because I know how hard it is to support a business as global as Facebook. Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
So, I'm very encouraged about our opportunity to sell ads all over the world. One thing I've learnt in my time selling ads on the internet, which is going over a decade now, is that markets that you don't expect to have ad markets develop faster than you would think. So if you were to ask me seven years ago what Turkey's ad market would look like, I would not have predicted it as today. So I'm increasingly encouraged by small businesses around the world and large businesses, and their adoption of the technology. I think with small businesses we have an actually really deep competitive advantage, which is that people all around the world use Facebook. So when small businesses who are historically way too busy to spend a lot of time using technologies, start to use the Facebook platform, they are using something they already use as users.
So once you have a timeline or a profile, setting up a page is not a very big ask because you understand it and you are doing it anyway. And that's why we think with almost no direct effort we have 16 million small businesses actively using Facebook pages. I think one of the things we have done well over the past number of quarters is build out simplified ad products like Promoted Posts, where it's easy for those people who are using pages and it happens all over the world typically on the advertisers and we are increasingly optimistic that we can do more and more of that.
David Ebersman
In terms of hiring, I think everything has gone quite well and as we have discussed 2013 is the year where we're investing for future growth, and I think in the first quarter both in terms of hiring and building out our infrastructure we are on track with where we want to be,
Operator
Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Two questions, maybe one for Sheryl and one for Mark. On ad pricing can you maybe just talk about CPMs for ads in the newsfeed versus ads on the right hand rail? Can you give us maybe just an idea so the magnitude of the difference between the two was that a big driver for that 21% increase? Then on video advertising I was just wondering, what’s the strategy to bring video advertising to Facebook and both in newsfeed and to desktop initially and then eventually on mobile assuming that there's enough bandwidth for that? Thanks.
David Ebersman
This is David; I'll take the first one which is about CPM. So the ads that we show in newsfeed are displayed more prominently and they are more in the flow of the user's attention. So as you would imagine, we get more engagement with those ads and they end up commanding a much higher average price per ad as you would expect.
Sheryl Sandberg
I'll take the second part. So video is a really exciting area because we have leveraged our scale and engagement and our ability to provide relevant ads. We have a video product out today. Advertisers can embed a video in their page post, and we're seeing really strong results. I think both because of that and because of marketers' inherent liking video as a format, we continue to explore new things as well, but we don't have anything to announce today.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess two questions, first on ad formats. Sheryl, do you think you've really optimized the ad formats, especially on PC or is there a lot of room you can do to get better performance from that? And then secondly, maybe you could just give us a business update on Instagram, maybe you could compare where they are to where Facebook was when you turned on ads or any thoughts on how you could monetize that platform maybe far down the road?
Sheryl Sandberg
On the first -- I think there's a lot of room to improve our ads. I don't know whether that'll take the format of different formats. I think more of it will be in terms of quality because I think we feel pretty good about our formats. But one of the main pushes we had is to make each ad a better experience for users, content in those ads, which is as good as the content they'll see from a friend or anything else on the site, as well as make those higher return for marketers and those two go hand in hand. I think the place you will see the most from us is more around targeting, around ability to take the formats we have and make the ads better within those formats. That’s certainly our focus now. But as our site evolves and our product evolves, we never rule out changing the format as well.
Mark Zuckerberg
Yes, on Instagram they're really doing well and growing really quickly. and I think that is the right for them and they have this opportunity to capture and basically build off this huge community. And I think that that should be a 100% of the focus right now. I am really optimistic about the business opportunity there too. You already have a lot of brands and folks who advertise with Facebook putting content in Instagram, getting huge engagement rates. So people are coming to us and asking for ways to make that even richer and it's something that we're thinking about. But right now I think that -- I'm just really product of the team and excited about how quickly they're growing. I mentioned this in my comments early on, but they're growing a lot faster now and we’re faster to get to 100 million than Facebook even was.
Operator
Your next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray
You've seen some acceleration of revenue over the last three quarters and can you just give us some guidelines in terms of should we continue to see that accelerate? And if not, at some point in the back half of this year or early next year based on some of the investments in new products, could we see another inflection point in growth? Thank you.
David Ebersman
I think we're still in the really early days of what we're doing and that's particularly true in mobile. A year ago, we didn't have any mobile ad revenue and now it's 30% of our ad revenue. So this is great. We're really pleased with the progress and we still believe that mobile has the opportunity to be huge for us if we can execute well. We've got a really large mobile user base. They are very engaged and spend a lot of time with us. We have an ad format that works on mobile and we have identity so that we can put the right ads in front of the right people. So, I think the future for us is I think much more interesting than trying to project it from any particular quarter at this point, just because we've got a lot less to do. And, obviously, we will continue to try and develop tools to enable us to monetize our advertising better and potentially in different ways as well. But the big opportunity that's right in front of us is trying to make the mobile advertising products higher quality and more relevant over time.

Your next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie
A couple of issues for Mark. I was wondering, first, if you could talk about the platform strategy and maybe give some specific examples of third parties that have really been successful. And in general, what are the lessons that you've learned around the platform strategy, how it's evolved? And then secondly, just around the evolution of Graph Search, any lessons from the launch, positive or negative?
Mark Zuckerberg
Sure. I mean one thing that I think has actually gone well with the platform recently is the gaming ecosystem. I mean David was talking about this earlier, but with the exception of our largest partner, Zynga, whose growth hasn't been as awesome as everyone would hope, the rest of the community is actually growing quite well and is quite healthy. So, we're pretty happy with that and it's a pretty diverse group. I mentioned in my comments at the beginning, I mean we have as many as 81 of the top 100 top grossing iOS apps and 70 of the top grossing Android apps that are connected in with Facebook. So we're getting good coverage, right. And that's all has been the vision, it's making it so that any apps and experience that you have can be social. So that's working well.
Also we really want to be a source that developers can come to for distribution and make it such that they can come to Facebook and spread their apps. People have always had good tools to do it organically, but recently the App Install ad product has been another tool in developers' arsenal in order to do that and that's showing some real traction. So, I'm pretty excited about that as well. Graph Search was your other question. And the strategy around it and kind of where we are in rolling out is, we developed it over a period of time at the company and we knew that in order to get it to be really good we had to get some real world data. So we rolled it out to just a small percent of people in order to be able to tune the ranking and all that. We're getting into a state where we are really happy with it before we roll it out to everyone. But we're really optimistic that that will happen over the coming months.
So, I'm pretty excited about that. The people who use it, we've gotten very positive feedback from it and I think it's going to be a very big opportunity. But the launch wasn't this point where we expected a ton of people to start using it. We've gated who can use it quite aggressively in order to just make sure that we get the data that we need and the real rollout will hopefully start pretty soon.

The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
I was wondering if you could talk about engagement per cohort. There is an urban myth that those under 25 are disengaging from Facebook. It's hard for us to see that in obviously the day that you report, but you would know that. Is the mobile engagement, is that offsetting that? Could you talk about that engagement amongst younger cohorts? And then secondly, you talked about advertising on mobile devices performing well. Could you actually make the statement as to whether it performs as well as desktop ads do for advertisers on Facebook, similar to, sometimes great or sometimes less? Could you compare those two? Thank you.
David Ebersman
Sure. I guess I'd start by saying we remain really pleased with the high level of engagement on Facebook by people of all ages around the world. You asked about people under 25, we continue to have really high penetration rates among that age group, both in the U.S. and globally. And the younger users remain among the most active and engaged users that we have on Facebook. And then in addition, younger users are extremely active users of Instagram as well. So that's great and makes our position even stronger.
I think, from our standpoint, the urban legend you referenced, sort of flows more often than not from surveys people have done of younger users that indicate that they're using other social services. And we take this feedback seriously but our sense is that much of the concern stems from the assumption that this is a zero sum game and that's not how we see it. We think the overall amount of time spent on services that enable you to connect and share is growing and will continue to grow, because these kinds of services are really engaging and good. And it's great for us to be the leader in a market that's expanding rapidly with the foundation we have with both Facebook and Instagram and I guess the challenge for us is to just continue building great products that appeal to users of all ages. Your second question about the engagement levels are the performance of mobile ads, I think it's fair to say that newsfeed ads on both mobile and desktop both perform extremely well and we're pleased with both formats.

The next question comes from Ken Sena with Evercore Partners. Your line is open.
Kenneth Sena - Evercore Partners
I was just hoping that you could go back to Atlas for a second and maybe give us a sense of maybe the run rate quarter-on-quarter. And is it correct to see Atlas is kind of an avenue into monetizing potential inventory off of Facebook and how do Home and maybe your mobile Open Graph tie into that strategy. Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg
Our main focus with Atlas is our own measurement, that being able to measure Facebook ads all the way through to purchase and then compare those on an apples to apples play with other ad purchases you make not on Facebook is really important to drive marketer engagement with us and that's our focus. We have no plans for launching that network. We also don’t break out -- we’re not breaking out the revenues from Atlas.
David Ebersman
And it’s small. So Atlas is -- we didn’t buy Atlas for the run rate of its revenues, but because we feel like it’s a tool that can help us to grow our own business.
Operator
The next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Sheryl, you talked about having strong traction with SMBs and also in direct response and app developers and then also about Atlas and attribution. But can you help us understand the biggest hurdles that you have right now with big marketers? And then secondly, David, if you could help us understand the percentage of mobile ads revenue that’s coming from mobile app Install ads?
Sheryl Sandberg
There are lots of types of big marketers. There are big marketers out there who are direct marketers. There are also big marketers who are brand marketers. I think the question probably is about the brand so that's how I’ll answer it, even though it’s worth noting that there are big advertisers across the spectrum of different type of ad buys. As I’ve said before, the thing about brand advertisers is that they got very used to TV and they got very used to search and we are a third thing. And we will win that business client by client, CMO by CMO. It’s something I personally spend a lot of time on and I think we have a great team in the field again. With some of the big brand advertisers, we have been working with them for years and years. A lot of the data and measurement you hear us talking about are studies we’ve done with them based on campaigns that we’ve run with. And I think we have a lot of belief at the top and in many of them we are in the process of going through their companies and getting that same commitment to buy.
So we’ll have a CMO who has seen the value, we’ve proven the value and really wants the company to come along. And now we are in the process of working brand by brand, region by region to get that same buy-in lower in the organization, which actually takes more time not surprisingly. With other brand marketers, they are just in a testing phase and they really haven't done enough with us so that we can even do the studies to prove the value. And so the good news with us is we're engaged with all 100, Ad Age 100. So everyone is buying with us on an annual basis and we're working client by client to bring them along that spectrum. The good news is I think we're increasingly proving that we can return on ad spend in different parts of the purchase funnel.
So to share one recent example, MGM Resorts have used a different suite of Facebook products to address different customers at different parts of the purchase funnel. They used offers to acquire new customers and they saw a three times return on ad spend. Then they used FBX to retarget people who were in their booking process and dropped out and that gave them a 15 times return on ad spend. And then for past guests who had completed a purchase but hadn’t come back, they used custom audiences to target them to return and they got a five times return. And I think it's experiences like that where we show the breadth of what we can do that really move us forward with the brand spenders.
David Ebersman
You asked about mobile app install ads. So we launched that product I think at the beginning of the fourth quarter more broadly. So it's early in its development, but really doing quite well. And we're pleased with both the quality of experiences we're providing and with the revenue growth that we've seen. It really fits in nicely with the idea of putting content into newsfeeds that we think will be of interest to users and provide value for developers. I guess the only other thing I've noticed that it's an incremental audience for us for the most part from an advertising standpoint which is also nice. Some of those developers were advertising with us before a lot of the mobile app Install Ad purchasers or new advertisers to Facebook.
Operator
The next question comes from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.
Brian Wieser - Pivotal Research
First of all, I just want to go back into the segments of the advertisers between the brands, developers, small businesses and performance. Is there any way you can characterize what maybe the growth trends have been, even recognizing some of them below the lines or ultimately growth trends between the different ad products. I find it useful to get a sense of where the relative growth is, that will be useful. And then a second question, I just want to get updated thoughts on datacenters and the role of datacenters for Facebook. The degree to which you think that it is strategic in investing and building these out or if it's really just about operational efficiency?
David Ebersman
So in terms of the segments, it's really hard to breakup the revenue because the same advertiser crosses multiple segments with multiple objectives, sometimes with the same ads. So one of the ways we use the segment is to help focus our product development on understanding the different objectives that marketers might have, but then translating that into individual groups of revenue is difficult. So I think that, as Sheryl mentioned, we're particularly pleased with small businesses. That's something that we can measure on Facebook and see the number of advertisers increasing.
In terms of datacenters, I think it is both strategic and operational. There's no question that owning our own datacenters removes sort of another party from the mix relative to when we used to lease datacenter space. It also enables us to build the datacenters to look exactly as we want them to look so that the performance is optimized for precisely what Facebook needs to do with the servers that we put in there, and there's definitely some efficiency that comes from that. But I would also say that it is, given what we are trying to do in the world we are trying to reach, I do think it's strategic for Facebook to not be dependent on third parties to provide that critical part of our supply chain.

The next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Aaron Kessler - Raymond James
Yes, couple of questions. On the unpublished Page posts, can you give us an update. I think that got released towards the end of the first quarter, maybe what type of traction you're seeing there. And also going back to kind of U.S. versus Europe, can you just maybe detail -- Europe definitely outperformed U.S. on a sequential basis, was that due to some of the later adoption of some of the sponsor stories in the News Feed or is that something else?
Sheryl Sandberg
On Page post, Page post ads first appeared May of last year and then we just put them into News Feed in March of 2013. In terms of unpublished, what that just means is the ability to target Page post only to the right people. So, for example, without posting it to everyone on your page. For example, if you are a retailer and there was a snow storm in one state, you could target snow shovels or other relevant stuff you want to sell for snow storms only to people in that state. So, it's just a really useful way of segmenting your audience, again part of our overall push to relevant targeting and quality. We're really excited about Page post ads. Over 7.5 million posts have been promoted by pages. Over 30% of the people using the product are new advertisers basically. And I think that speaks to one of the earlier questions on small-to-medium business and their adoption. If you say to an SMB, do you want to become an advertiser, that's a heavy lift. If you say to them, you have a page, you've posted something, do you want to pay a few dollars to promote this post to reach more people, that is a much easier on ramp to advertising spend with us and we think it's working really well.
David Ebersman
In terms of U.S. and Europe, I really don't have a lot more to add. The Europe number as I said was strong in Q1. I'm certain it's true that for some of the products that we roll out the U.S. represents the first adapters and then they spread their way to other clients around the world. But I don't have any specific evidence to support that that was key to the trends in Q1.
Deborah Crawford
Operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
The next question comes from Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research. Your line is open.
Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research
Two questions if I may. If we look at the broad base of all ad impressions across Facebook whether it's desktop or mobile, can you give us a sense of what percentage of those are generated or conditioned by social statistics or socially relevant data that comes out of the Facebook experience versus ads conditioned by external data like from Acxiom or it's from retargeting traffic from other websites. And then second, within the category of apps and others, can you give us a sense of is there any materiality around the other categories that’s not apps payments or what part of that might have been Facebook type services like gifts? Thank you.
David Ebersman
So to your first question on mobile and I think the question was on mobile ad load, is that right?
Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research
No. It was whether it's mobile or desktop, what part of the --?
David Ebersman
All right. I got lost in the second question which I should have written down to the first one. So right now you asked about Acxiom and things like that. That’s a very small percentage of the ad impressions we show. So hopefully overtime we can bring tools to bear that can really increase our ability to do more targeting and more effective targeting than we do today. In terms of the second part, I think you're asking about the whole payments and another fees revenue lines. So I said the whole line grew by 15%. Games represented 12% growth. So the increment in between the 12% and the 15% came primarily from user promoted posts, which is a product we launched last year to a lesser degree also from our gifts product.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you very much.Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook’s Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.Deborah CrawfordThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Facebook’s fourth quarter and full-year earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and David Ebersman, CFO.Before we get started, I’d like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the course of this call, we’ll make forward-looking statements regarding the future events and the future financial performance of the Company. We caution you to consider the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements in the press release and this conference call.

A rebroadcast of the call will be available after 6 p.m. Pacific Time today. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are also available on our website. After management’s remarks, we will host a Q&A session.And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.Mark ZuckerbergThanks everyone for joining us. 2012 was a big year for us. We made this big transition where now there are more people using Facebook on mobile everyday than on desktop. This was challenging for us to navigate since we started off the year with apps that weren’t as high quality as we wanted, and no ads in our apps at all. But now we’re coming out of the year with a strong foundation and a lot of momentum. Just last week, comScore put out a report saying that Facebook is now 23% of all time spent on apps in the U.S, and one of the next biggest apps is Instagram at 3%. So, put together, we’re now more than a quarter of the time spent in apps. Today, there’s no argument. Facebook is a mobile company. As I’ve said before, there are three main parts of our strategy; build the best mobile products, build the platform and services that leverage the social graph, and build a really strong monetization effort engine.I am going to use our time today in the same way I will on most of these calls to give my assessment of how I think we’re doing against each of these big areas; let’s start with mobile. I think more people are starting to understand that mobile is a great opportunity for us. Mobile is the perfect device for Facebook for three reasons. It allows us to reach more people. We have more engagements from the people who we reach, and I think we’ll also be able to make more money for each minute people spend with us on their mobile devices. But mobile isn’t just driving greater engagement on Facebook. Mobile enables many new experiences, and its growing overall sharing across all apps. This creates a very dynamic ecosystem, and one where there’s a lot of room for us to create even more sharing through Facebook. Often doing a good job is just about focusing on basic issues like performance and stability.In December, we released a completely rewritten version of Facebook for Android. This is the Android version of the iOS rewrite we did earlier last year. Neither of these rewrites added big new features, but simply by improving speed and stability, we’ve made a much better user experience enabling people to share even more. It's a good example of how early we are in the market that these changes make such a big difference. Photos and Instagram are doing really well too. We had our best day ever on New Year’s day with more than 600 million photos uploaded to Facebook. Instagram has continued growing very quickly, and hopefully we’ll have some new milestones to share with you all soon.A lot of what we had to do last year was simply to improve our mobile development process; now we’re there. We move fast and ship new versions of our apps on a regular monthly cycle. You have a good version of all the Facebook features you know and want on your phone. So, now the next thing we’re going to do is get really good at building new mobile first experiences. That’s going to be a big theme for us this year. If we do this well, we should be able to bring even more relevant content and connections to more people and continue to deepen their engagement.Next, I want to talk about platform and building new services using the social graph. Normally, I’ll use this section to talk about what’s going on in the ecosystem outside of our company, but this quarter, I think we built the most interesting new service using the social graph, Graph Search. This is an early beta product, but we're really excited about it because it's an entirely new kind of search. It's not Web search, its structured search over the whole graph of content that people have mapped out on Facebook. It's good for lots of things that you just won't use the traditional search engine for it. Seeing where your friends have eaten or traveled to, browsing photos and content your friends posted, finding new people to meet or recruit for a job, and many other things.So many of these are big areas where we think that there is room for much better products. Down the line if we do this well, this could potentially turn into a meaningful business for us. For now, we're going to continue working to refine the product and roll it out to everyone. Still, I think the way that Graph Search is different from normal web search is a good example of how there is going to be this market for a whole new crop of social services in existing markets today that were designed with the principles of real identity and social connections, et cetera.One platform development that I am really excited by is seeing how well our App install advertising product is doing. Developers are finding that Facebook is a great service for connecting with the right people who want to use their apps and getting a lot of installs. On mobile, our platform already enables developers to help you bring your friend to a developer's app. We also want to be one of the primary ways that developers get new people to their apps in the first place, and with App install ads, we're off to a good early start in achieving that.Now I want to talk a bit about monetization. Last year was a big year for us here. We started off the year with no ads at all on mobile and we ended up with approximately 23% of our ads revenue coming from mobile in the fourth quarter. That's a pretty amazing change. One of the big drivers of this has been that as we rolled out our ads to News Feed, we found that it barely affected the level of engagement on Facebook. We thought that we can make this work over time without a big impact if we spent a long time tuning the ad, but the numbers turned out even better than we thought without much tuning. So, this has enabled us to show people a few ads in News Feed each day. So that means that now we have this News Feed ads business that we barely tuned and there's a big opportunity in front of us to make every ad that we're showing a lot better.The biggest ways we're going to do this are by improving targeting and relevance, so we can show everyone content that they care more about and by designing better ad products that aren't just about links and text and images. For targeting, I'm most excited about the work that we're doing on Custom Audiences, our tool that lets advertisers upload their customer list and target against that and information is already on Facebook at the same time. Say, my customers are in some age range and live in some state, you may not know which states your customer is living, but if they've shared it on Facebook, then it's possible to create these kinds of experiences.For new ad experiences, I'm looking forward to doing more with different kinds of media. As our News Feed design evolves to show richer kinds of stories that open up new opportunities to offer different kinds of ads as well. Aside from ads, I do want to temper near-term expectations a little bit on revenue lines coming from other areas, like Gifts or Graph Search. I think these can be big opportunities for us long-term, but for the foreseeable future, the most important thing for us is to continue building out great consumer experiences around these products. We're going to invest in these, but for the next year at least, our work around ads will have by far the biggest impact on our business.Now, before I hand it off to Sheryl, there's one more thing I want to discuss. We're at an interesting point in our evolution where there are lots of areas where we need to invest in. We need to build the best mobile experiences, we need to build our platforms, and we need to build a really strong monetization engine. We can easily invest our entire engineering team just in building out the nuts and bolts of these areas today.But we also feel like there is an imperative to start planting seeds for tomorrow's businesses as well. Products like Graph Search that are in beta today, but will hopefully grow up to be pillars of the Facebook service and businesses, are things that we want to invest in aggressively and things we feel like it's the right thing for our business over the longer term to invest in aggressively.Based on this, we made the decision to continue to grow our headcount quickly in 2013, particularly in product development. This will likely cause our expenses to grow at a faster rate than we expect to grow our revenue this year. This means that we aren't operating to maximize our profits this year. We're doing what we think will build the best service and business over the long term.Finally, I just want to take a minute to thank everyone who works at Facebook. Last year really was an amazing year for us on many levels. We connected 1 billion people, we navigated the transition to becoming a mobile company, and we've laid the foundation for some great new products I'm excited to show the world this year. And this is all because we have this unique culture filled with some of the most talented people in the world who are still mission-driven, who want to make the world a better place and who work so hard to make the world that place.Thank you all. And thanks to everyone who's on this call for taking the time to be with us today. I look forward to being able to report on all the progress we'll make next quarter.Now, I’m going to hand the podium over to Sheryl.Sheryl SandbergThanks, Mark. So our ad business continued its positive trajectory in the fourth quarter. Total fourth quarter revenue was $1.585 billion with $1.329 billion coming from ads. This represents a 41% increase for advertising revenue. Ad revenue from News Feed increased across both desktop and mobile, and in Q4, approximately 23% of our ad revenue came from mobile, up from approximately 14% in Q3. Our focus in the fourth quarter was to continue improving and scaling the products we launched in 2012. We know that our advertising products are delivering results for marketers and one of the best indicators of this came over the holiday season where more businesses, from big brands to small retailers used us as a core part of their holiday outreach.Perhaps the biggest highlight in the fourth quarter was the increasing importance of mobile, not just to Facebook, but also to our clients. Marketers are realizing more and more that Facebook is one of the best places to reach their customers on mobile because of our unique ability to reach specific target audiences at scale.Another highlight, is the traction, our Offers and Promoted Posts products, which are really easy to use, have given us at local businesses. As I described last quarter, our strategy is focused on three priorities. One, building products and tools that create value for every type of marketer. Two, proving that value to marketers; and three, taking advantage of the unique opportunity we have in mobile.Starting with the first, we build products that create value for every type of marketer. We continue our focus on four key customer segments; brand marketers, direct marketers, local businesses, and developers. For brand marketers, we combine access to the largest community of real people in the world with some of the industry’s best targeting capabilities. We now work with every one of the Ad Age Global 100 Advertisers. And overall revenue from these clients is growing through consistently with our ad revenue in 2012, which means that significantly outpaced the estimates for overall ad spend from the industry.In the fourth quarter, we launched a new way for advertisers to buy guaranteed ad impressions with the goal of helping them reach massive audiences on mobile. Wal-Mart used this target block over the important Thanksgiving weekend to deliver 50 million mobile ads to their existing and potential customers. We think this is a very important fact in the evolution of mobile advertising as these numbers rivaled a scale of broader web and TV campaigns.Increasingly companies use Facebook as the exclusive channel to launch new products. To share one example, Michael Kors has used Facebook to launch a line of new sneakers. Many of the sneakers sold out online and in new stores, and they achieved a 60 point increase in awareness of the new sneakers among the 36 million people that the campaign reached on Facebook. That’s the equivalent of 5.8 million new people in the brand’s target audience who are now aware of the new line of shoes.For direct marketers, the products we launched in the third quarter continued to bring traction in Q4 as well. Since we launched our Offers  product at the end of September, we've seen stronger advertiser adoption and user engagement with nearly 42 million unique users claiming an offer. Cost per redemption compared favorably to those from email, newspaper, paid search, and display media based on data from the Direct Marketing Association. Discounts and promotions are often important tactics for direct marketers and we think our Offers product is well placed to compete for these media budgets.As Mark said one of the products we’re most excited about is Custom Audiences, which lets the marketers show their ads to exactly the right people by coupling our rich targeting capabilities with their own customer data or data from a third party. A large retailer for example, can send one set of ads to customers who typically buy foreign goods and a different set of ads to those who would purchase beauty products. This results in some of the best targeting available on or offline today.To share one example, JackThreads, an online shopping site for men used Custom Audiences to target specific segments on its customer database and target them with ads for products that the company knew were most relevant to them such as sneakers. As a result, the company achieved a 30% lower cost for acquisition than other platforms and saw a six times return on advertising spend.It's important to understand that Custom Audiences is not a separate standalone ad product, but rather a targeting capability that can be used with many of our ad products to drive greater accuracy and efficiency. For example, when Custom Audiences is used with offers, marketers can customize discounts for exactly the right kind of customers.The Facebook Exchange or FBX allows businesses to bid on specific ad impressions in real time and it continues to gain momentum and drive solid results for advertisers. Despite only becoming available to all marketers in September, by December FBX served nearly 1 billion impressions daily and supported over 1,300 advertisers each day. Large and small advertisers alike are seeing higher click-through rates, lower cost per conversion, and strong incremental reaches in FBX.Revenue from local businesses was particularly strong in the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the number of local business pages that advertise on Facebook nearly doubled since the beginning of 2012. This is due in no small part to our Promoted Posts product, which makes it easier for businesses to create and purchase ads directly from their Facebook page. Almost 500,000 pages have used Promoted Posts, about 30% of these are new advertisers to Facebook, and more than 70% have become repeat customers.Finally for developers, we continue to gain traction with our new mobile app install ads, since their launch in October, they are already being used by 20% of the top 100 grossing iOS apps to accelerate growth. According to research conducted by comScore in December, Facebook is the top driver of awareness of new mobile app downloads; and among people who learn about new apps on Facebook, 48% clicked directly from the Facebook apps to download new mobile apps.Cie Games uses products to drive installs of its new game Car Town Streets. As a result, they've broken to the top 10 games list on iOS in many countries while achieving a 40% lower cost per installation compared to their other advertising. In addition to gaming, we believe this will be a very useful product to help companies and industries like retail, travel, and financial services shift their businesses to mobile.Next, I'll also step on our commitment to provide proving value -- proving Facebook's value to marketers. We design all of our products to deliver a strong return on investment. Given that we are still a relatively new marketing platform, proving that our ads are effective remains an important and ongoing priority for us. We work with research companies like Nielsen, Aggregate Knowledge, and Datalogix to demonstrate how our ads drive sales and help inform our product development.For example, research from Aggregate Knowledge showed that Facebook is an increasingly powerful tool to help marketers reach more people and drive sales. In the study of fourth quarter marketing campaigns, they found that media plans that included Facebook reached people who would not have seen the campaigns otherwise. In fact, 45% of those reached were reached exclusively through Facebook. The study also found that Facebook had a 68% lower cost per acquisition and drove 24% more new sales than other online channels. We also work with clients directly to integrate with their own measurement systems so they can better understand the ROI Facebook delivers.For example, we built a deep relationship with PepsiCo where we worked with its Lay's brand to drive significant sales ahead of plans and a 5x return on ad spend for their Do Us a Flavor campaign on Facebook. In the fourth quarter, we also made conversion tracking available in beta. Conversion tracking allows marketers of all sizes to more easily measure the impact of their Facebook advertising, whether the Facebook ad is the first ad or the last ad the person sees before taking an action.Finally, I want to discuss how we're continuing to take advantage of the significant opportunity we have in mobile. As mentioned before, approximately 23% of our advertising revenue now comes from mobile. In addition, 65% of our advertisers are now using ads in News Feed which run on both desktop and mobile up from 50% at the end of the third quarter. Marketers are recognizing that our News Feed is the most efficient and effective place to reach their customers due in large part to the fact that ads in News Feed see a higher click-through rate and ultimately a lower cost per conversion and ads on the right-hand side of our site.By working with Datalogix, we have shown that as the News Feed also drives more than 8 times the incremental offline sales in ads on the right-hand side. Clients also recognize that because our users share their real identities on Facebook and because they are logged in when they use Facebook on mobile, we have a unique ability to start advertising that people find relevant. This is an important competitive advantage for us relative to other mobile platforms and one we think we are very unique in.Overall, we continue to make real progress advancing our advertising strategy. Our revenue and key metrics are growing nicely, and as we look ahead to 2013, we're very confident in the direction of our ad business.Over 1 billion people are on Facebook, and we are enabling businesses to engage with them directly wherever they are. Our massive scale, accurate targeting, strength in mobile, and new advertising products are driving measurable results for all types of businesses and transforming the way people and businesses connect. We look forward to making even more progress in these areas in the year ahead.Now, I'll hand it over to David.David EbersmanThanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with the progress we made in Q4 against our key financial priorities, growing revenue, investing aggressively in areas critical to our future performance, and positioning the company to maximize long-term financial returns.We ended the year with 1.06 billion people using Facebook, up 25% from a year-ago. In December, 618 million people accessed Facebook each day on average, up 28% from last year. and we grew monthly and daily users across all geographic regions. Mobile continues to drive our growth. 680 million people accessed Facebook from mobile devices in December, up 57% versus last year. And the numbers I just mentioned do not include Instagram, which continues to grow at an impressive rate. We ended 2012 with strong engagement across our products. and this engagement remains a foundation for everything we’re trying to build.Turning to revenue, in Q4, revenue was up 40% year-over-year or 42% when adjusted for constant exchange rates. Q4 year-over-year growth would have been 34% if adjusted to exclude the additional month of payments transactions we recognized as planned. Ad revenue in Q4 was up 41% or 43% when adjusted for constant exchange rates. Year-over-year advertising growth in Q4 was the strongest of any quarter in 2012, and we view this as a validation of our recent investments in mobile News Feed ads, growing our advertiser base, and launching new ad products.In the fourth quarter, ad impressions were up 46%, and average price per ad was down 4% compared to last year. These trends were driven by significantly faster impression growth in developing markets such as Asia and Latin America, which have relatively lower pricing, and thereby brought down our average price overall. The faster impression growth in developing markets in Q4 was significantly affected by product changes, primarily our decision to lower the market reserve price or the floor price we accept in our auction, which increased the number of ads shown in these markets.We continue to see positive trends in price per ad in key developed markets, including an 18% increase in average price in the U.S. and Canada in Q4. Payments and other revenue was $256 million in Q4. As planned, in Q4 we recognized revenue from four months of payments transactions for accounting reasons detailed in our last 10-Q. Adjusting for the extra month, payments’ revenues from games was essentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2011.This past quarter, payments and other revenue also included around $5 million from sources outside of games, primarily user promoted posts and to a lesser extent from our new Gifts product.Shifting now to expenses, in Q4, our total GAAP expenses were $1.06 billion. Excluding the impact of stock compensation, total expenses increased 67% to $849 million driven primarily by headcount and infrastructure. We ended 2012 with just over 4,600 employees, a 44% increase from last year driven by hiring in our technical groups. We were recently ranked the number one place to work by Glassdoor, which we view as a testament to how strong our culture remains through this period of significant headcount growth.In Q4, our GAAP operating income was $523 million. Excluding stock comp, our non-GAAP operating income was $736 million representing a 46% operating margin. Our GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 87% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 41%. For 2013, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be a few percentage points higher than the rate in Q4. Additionally, we ended the year with approximately $5.8 billion in NOL tax loss carry forwards created by stock compensation.GAAP net income and EPS for the fourth quarter was $64 million or $0.03 per share. Non-GAAP net income and EPS was $426 million or $0.17 per share compared to $0.15 in Q4 last year. We ended Q4 with $9.6 billion in cash and investments giving us great flexibility and risk protection.Looking forward now, we believe we've built a solid foundation for continued growth in 2013 and beyond. In our ads business, we believe we have good momentum and plan to continue investing to grow advertiser demand and improve the quality, engagement, and value of our ads, particularly in News Feed.In terms of 2013 expectations for payments, our games ecosystem continues to show healthy signs of diversification with new kinds of games growing engagement and monetization in Q4. However, we continue to face an offsetting headwind from declining desktop usage in developed markets since our games payments revenue is essentially all from desktop computers.In terms of non-games payments revenue, while we remain excited about the long-term potential of commerce on Facebook, current revenue from user Promoted Posts and Gifts is very small, and we expect 2013 contributions from these initiatives to remain very small given current run rates.In terms of infrastructure, we expect CapEx spend in 2013 will be in the neighborhood of $1.8 billion, as we continue to invest in servers, new data centers, and network infrastructure to enable us to bring Facebook speedily and reliably to everyone around the world.We're pleased that planned 2013 CapEx spend is up relatively modestly compared to 2012 which came in under forecast at a shade under $1.6 billion as our investments in software and hardware efficiency are paying off nicely.As Mark noted, 2013 will be a year of significant investment in areas we believe are critical to drive long-term engagement and monetization, and we plan to continue to hire aggressively to accelerate product development and deliver new products for users and advertisers.As a result of our hiring and investment plans, we expect that our total expenses, excluding stock comp, will likely grow by somewhere around 50% in 2013, though actual growth will depend on hiring and project decisions we make through the year.We believe this level of near-term investment is the right strategic decision to enable long-term value creation. We're excited about the potential returns from investing in our product. We continue to feel there's operating leverage inherent in our business, and we're committed to building a highly profitable cash generating business over the long term.In summary, we believe we're entering 2013 in a strong position. We're working in very large markets that offer us great opportunities for growth. We have uniquely valuable assets in terms of the size, identity, and engagement of the people who use Facebook and we have a fantastic group of employees who have big aspirations to build on our financial performance from 2012.Now let's open the call for questions.Question-and-Answer Session
Operator(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open.Douglas Anmuth – JPMorganGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask two things. First, can you help us understand the mobile trajectory through 4Q just given the commentary you gave about exiting 3Q at $270 million run rate and doing a little bit more than $300 million in the fourth quarter, did you open up more additional inventory in 4Q from the late 3Q levels, and did you see any notable change in pricing? And then, can you also just comment on how you feel about the volume of ad load in the News Feed right now on both desktop and mobile, and perhaps in terms of baseball innings, where you think you are in terms of penetration? Thanks.David EbersmanSo I'll take the first half. So, I think the most important thing is that we think mobile can be a huge opportunity for us, and we're really pleased with the progress we made in the fourth quarter. If you compare the averages, Q3 versus Q4 on mobile revenues – if you compare the overall revenue, our mobile revenue doubled from Q3 to Q4, and we continue to make progress also in terms of the quality and the relevance of the mobile ads that we show. I think the most important thing here is that we're still really early. A couple of quarters ago, mobile revenues were 0% of our ads revenue and now we're up to 23% and believe that there's a lot more we can do and a lot of growth ahead of us.Mark ZuckerbergI'll speak to the quality piece. So, one of the things that we measure for News Feed quality is the amount of feedback that we get, so likes and comments and things like that. And just to give a sense of the magnitude of these things, the ranking improvements and things that we did over the course of last year improved the amount of feedback in News Feed on the order of about 50%, right. So I think – I don't know if it was quite exactly 50%, but it was on that order. We measure very closely when we take into account advertising and spend in order to rank ads into News Feed, we're inherently not showing what would have organically showed up in that slots, so we want to make sure that we're not decreasing quality by a big amount.So what we found was that when we did the test to take out the ads, we were inserting the ads, had about 2% reduction in the amount of likes and comments. So, over the period of last year, we had on the order of 50% increase and then a very marginal offset of 2% for putting ads in, which just makes us feel really confident that we're continuing to very strongly net improve the experience of Feed and that's one of the things that I mentioned in my script report. I wasn't – and we weren't that – we're confident we could get this to a good place over time in terms of being a good experience. But the amount of the improvements that we've done have just dwarfed the quantitative feedback hit that we –anything that we’ve seen on the ads is very promising to us in terms of what we’re going to be able to do going forward.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is now open.Ben Schachter - Macquarie GroupMark, in the comments you said, you were looking at different types of media for ads. I was wondering at a high level if you could talk about how that would potentially change the overall Facebook experience? And if you could give some real examples for how these different types of ad units would come into play? And then also just separately engagement, I was wondering if you could give us any update on how you’re viewing engagement or any change to how you measure it and any views on how that going through the quarter? Thanks.Mark ZuckerbergSure. So, one of the product design principles that we’ve always had is we want the organic content to be of the same basic type of formats as paid content, right. So historically, advertisers want really rich things like big pictures or videos, and we haven’t provided those things historically. But one of the things that we’ve done in the last year, as you’ve seen, the organic News Feed product that consumers use are , moving towards bigger pictures, richer media, and I think you will continue to see it go in that direction. And then, I think a lot of the success of products like Instagram is because of that. It’s very immersive even on a small screen, it’s a wonderful photo product, and when you have those form factors for the content that gives you the ability to offer those form factors for advertising as well. So I think you see the trend there in terms of where it’s going and that’s just naturally going to make it, so we can deliver much more engaging advertising experiences than we were traditionally able to do and when we didn’t have those types of content in the system. David can speak to some of the facts that you’re asking about.David EbersmanSo in terms of engagement overall, everything continues to go very well. We passed 1 billion users, and in the fourth quarter 59% of them used Facebook on an average day in December, which is up a couple of percent from where we started the year. So just pretty remarkable how -- as we continue to grow the user base, that number continues to grow up, it really speaks to the value of the service and the importance of mobile, which is really driving that.There is another metric we track, which measures the number of people who have come to the site in at least six of the last seven days. So, it shows sort of the audience for whom Facebook is a daily experience and that we ended the year with record highs on that metric as well. So, everything continues to go well, and our job is to make Facebook a better, more useful product, so we can continue to drive new kinds of engagement in the future.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionGreat, thank you. I had a question for Sheryl, and then a question for Mark. Sheryl, I was wondering if you can share with us what you’ve seen from FBX. I know it's still early, but what milestones you’re looking to hit with this business in 2013? And then Mark, just kind of wondering kind of where you think we are in terms of the social ad revolution, and when you look out over the next 12 months; what do you think could surprise you the most in terms of the revenue opportunities that are ahead of you when you look out for 2013? Thanks.Sheryl SandbergSo, on FBX as everyone knows, it's real-time bidding for specific instructions. We’re very encouraged by what we see both in terms of marketer demand and ad performance, and the numbers as I said in my opening remarks are getting higher. We see good data from our clients and customers that it's driving more conversions. We have data from one of our customer, one of our clients Triggit that FBX drives 36% more conversions than re-targeting anywhere else. Shutterfly had a 4x higher return on ad spend than other platforms, and we have a bunch of other examples like that.I would say the importance of FBX is not just the product itself, but really what it represents and the other opportunities around making the ads more targeted. So FBX is one way of making the ads better targeted and then more useful to users, which makes some higher return from advertisers. Custom Audiences is another, but I think what you’re seeing from us is a really big push to make our ads higher quality, better for users, higher return for advertisers, and FBX is just one of many ways we’re working on doing that.Mark ZuckerbergYeah, I mean, I’ll just add to that a little bit, but I think you mostly covered it. I think we’re really early, but what we really expected was to not be able to necessarily show everyone an ad every day, because we weren’t sure that we had the quality upfront and that was some of the engagement metrics that I was talking about before. So, we’ve been positive, we’re surprised that the quality has been naturally high and there’s been basically no engagement hit at all that’s very meaningful. So, what that means is that now – previously we thought we were going to have to spend 6 to 12 months just tuning in order to be able to get into a quality level and then incrementally roll out ads, whereas now we’ve had them rolled out, and now we can go straight into doing the same types of things to improve targeting and improve the quality of the ad format, which obviously when they’re fully deployed has much more leverage to those changes than if we had to kind of wait until we hit different quality thresholds to roll it out more. So, I think we're just pretty early. I don’t know -- it's not that it's going to go in a completely different direction, I think it's mostly the two things that we've talked about so far, good targeting and good ad formats, and I think there's just a lot of room to grow in both.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Carlos Kirjner from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.Carlos Kirjner - Sanford BernsteinThank you. I have two questions. Can you help us understand why ad ARPU in the U.S. grew 27%while it grew only 7% in Europe? Is spend on Facebook that sensitive to macro? And on the platform, can you help me understand what metric you track to evaluate the progress and adoption of the Facebook platform outside Facebook.com? Is that the number of pages or objects tagged with Open Graph? And are you in a race with Google's Knowledge Graph to be the basis of the semantic web or can both co-exist? Thank you.David EbersmanYes, Carlos, I'll take the first one. So I think that when you compare the disclosure we make about the U.S. and Canada to Europe, one of the notable differences is in Europe as we continue to penetrate that market, we're getting into some of the lower monetizing countries in Europe, so there's sort of an inter-Europe lower price dynamic going on with the ads. The places that are growing more rapidly are starting at a lower price point and bringing down the average either on a CPM basis or on an ARPU basis. So I do think there are macro things that matter in Europe as well, but I think that's the bigger point.Mark ZuckerbergYes. In terms of the point on structured data, there's Open Graph in order to help developers and people map out all the different connections between things outside the Facebook, but I mean, one of the things that we talked about when we rolled our Graph Search is there are more than 1 trillion connections between people and things in Facebook today. I mean that's the basis for Graph Search. I think a lot of the – the goal of having a utility like Graph Search is also to give people a reason to map out more of these structured connections themselves.And you mentioned the Google comparison, I think we're just coming from a completely different place. Our whole product is people in structured connections to other people and content and things that they like, whereas traditional Web search is the exact opposite. It's completely unstructured. So I think Google and others may be trying to put in some of the structured foundations, but we just have years of having built that up, and I think that we're just in a completely different place on that.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.Youssef Squali - Cantor FitzgeraldYes, thank you very much. Two questions please. First, starting with David, first thank you for helping quantify the increase in operating expenses next year. I was wondering if, maybe, you can help us with kind of the trajectory of that spend throughout the year? How long do you think this investment cycle is going to be? Is it mostly in 2013 or is this a multiyear cycle? Then maybe Mark, maybe -- can you talk just about the video opportunity for Facebook, video on the News Feed, so where are you in that process? Would that be something that organically you guys can do or would that require you guys to maybe acquire? Thanks.David EbersmanSo Youssef, we think we've got some really big and important opportunities right in front of us now and that's driving our decision making around the level of investment we're making which is important to us in 2013. That will moderate over time, but I wouldn't want to make a firm commitment to exactly what it's going to look like in the future because particularly the R&D part of its going to depend on what the opportunities are and how excited we are about the returns we can get from them.Sheryl SandbergOpportunity for video, not just ads --.Mark ZuckerbergI think I touched on some of this earlier in terms of making it that News Feed is richer, just enables more opportunity for this. There already are the ability for pages to post videos and different content into the systems. We actually have a very large volume of this. Another thing that we have the ability to support is people posting links on other services, right. So, for video advertising, it's not necessarily critical that we host the video. I mean, we want to be the distribution platform for a lot of the stuff. But I feel there's definitely an opportunity, and over time, we'll have more to talk about it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.Scott Devitt - Morgan StanleyThanks. I had a different question on that regional ARPU slide which is I guess, wondering the pace or may be where we’re now from a sponsored story rollout and relative ad load in the U.S. relative to Europe and Asia? And then secondly, it looks like the absolute additions of mobile users and mobile-only users was quite strong in the quarter, it was up 25% in terms of mobile ads and 30% in terms of mobile-only ads versus the third quarter, and Mark mentioned a few areas, I was just wondering if there is any one or two things that really stand out in terms of driving that acceleration. Thanks.David EbersmanOkay. In terms of the ARPU by geography, I don’t know that I have a lot more color to offer, in terms of the mobile News Feed rollout, as you would expect with a new advertising product, really in the end of the second quarter and the third quarter, it took off first in the U.S., and Europe followed, and I think the growth was much more notable for that product area in Asia and the rest of world in the fourth quarter as compared to the third and that's just sort of the natural progression of how rollouts tend to go for us.In terms of your second question about the increase in mobile users and mobile-only users, which we agree is really important and impressive. I don’t know that we’d point to anyone thing that drove that just as much as continued penetration of smartphones in – around the world in many markets and our ability to make our products better so that people are more inclined to use them.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open.Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital MarketsGreat. Thanks. I know it’s very early stages, the rollout of the Graph Search but any early signs of the impact that that has had on engagement? And then Mark you mentioned just early on about the new products, maybe some mobile specific products and features, any hint as to what those could be? Thanks a lot.Mark ZuckerbergUnfortunately I don’t think there is that much that I can share with you on either of those. I mean on Graph Search it’s still early. I’m – this is one of the products that I’m the most excited about that we have built. It is a completely new pillar of our ecosystem and I think it’s going to be an important utility that people use. Right now, the whole strategy around this is, it's a beta product, and we are primarily rolling it out in order to get more data, so that we can incorporate the data of how people use it to make ranking better before we do a full rollout. So, right now it's rolled out to the order of 10’s or 100’s of 1000’s of people not extremely widely, and I mean -- so we have data, but I don’t think anything that is – that’s really relevant to share beyond that.In terms of the new experiences, I think the big theme that we’re just going to push on mobile is, people keep on asking if we’re going to build a phone. And we’re not going to build a phone, right, because that’s – it’s not the right strategy for us to – I mean, to build one integrated system where, I mean, so let’s say we sold 10 million units, there’ll be 1% of users who cares for us, right? But the big thing for us is we've 1 billion people using our products and we need to make Facebook really good across all of the devices that they use and we’re going to keep on pushing to get kind of more integrated with the system, I mean, when Facebook is a product that people are spending almost near 20% of their time or more on phones using, it really should be and I think people want it to be very integrated into all of the different devices that they have, and that’s what we’re going to focus on. So, rather than just kind of building an app that’s a version of the functionality that you have today, I think making it so that we can just kind of do -- go deeper and deeper, I think it's going to be a big focus for us.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.Ross Sandler – Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.Great, yeah just one question for David on the right-hand rail revenue. So, based on our math, the overall News Feed business may have been around $500 million-ish in the fourth quarter which would imply about a 10% decline for right-hand rail revenue. Does that make sense directionally, and if so, can you just talk about how you think right-hand rail is likely to trend in 2013 and can the new ad tools like Custom Audiences help offset the desktop traffic decline that you’re seeing in markets like U.S. and Europe? Thanks.David EbersmanYeah, thanks for your question, Ross, I mean, for us the most important metric is that the overall ad revenue increased 41%. I think that the way we think about things, it's hard to really separate out the mobile and desktop or Feed and right-hand column as sort of separate and distinct businesses because for most of our ads, marketers would tell us what ad they want to show and to what audience they want us to show the ad and we choose where it goes. It's not true for a 100% of the ads, but it's certainly true in the majority case.So our job is to find a place to put the ads that will create the most value for the user and the marketer. So, the overall ad revenue number really provides just a better sense of how much advertising demand there is in the system that we're able to service, and over time, we'll continue to experiment with how to optimize that. In general, you can see from the user numbers that the growth in usage is coming from mobile, particularly in developed markets, the desktop usage continues to be flat or declining. So, that's obviously the macro trend that will affect what the future of the right-hand column revenues are.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Citi. Your line is now open.Neil Doshi - CitiGreat. Thanks, guys. Mark, could you maybe tell us how far along you are in terms of developing tools and providing more data and metrics to large agencies and advertisers? And then David, in terms of the gaming declines that we're seeing on Facebook desktop, is there an opportunity for Facebook to help monetize or to monetize games that are played on Facebook on the mobile side? Thank you.Mark ZuckerbergYes, these are important. Sheryl has more details on this. So, I think she should probably take the first one.Sheryl SandbergYes. Measurement is really important for us and it's one of the challenges we face. I remember, through the years I've worked on this. We know when search happened, people weren't able to measure it, and then they figured out how to measure search. And more a new thing, and people need to think about measurement differently. One of the most important things that we need to do in the market is help educate people that the click is not really the most important metric for us. In fact now that we've been able to work with companies to look at in-store sales data, we find that of the people who saw a Facebook ad and then purchased the product in the store, 99% of them never clicked on an ad, so re-educating the market what the metrics are that are right for us.I would say in terms of our measurement capabilities, we're really early. We weren't able to tie into sales data at all until pretty late in 2012. In order to do those studies, we have to work very deeply with retail providers and each client. A lot of our big clients have their own departments that do this measurement, and we work with them individually. So we're pretty early. We're happy with the progress we have made. We launched conversion measurements just in mid-December, and now that's probably available on this system, but I think we have a lot of opportunity to do a lot more measurement a lot more rapidly.We're particularly excited about our ability to do this on mobile. With customers who have -- using their data in a privacy-protected way, we can now measure all the way from seeing a Facebook ad in a mobile device through to purchase in a store and that's a pretty exciting capability. We think it's pretty unique in the market.David EbersmanSo, Neil, your second question was about mobile gaming. It's an interesting question as well. What we're seeing now is really strong growth and adoption of our platform in games on both iOS and Android, and we want Facebook to be the default social infrastructure for mobile games and feel like we're making progress in that direction and convincing developers that they'll get more users, more engaged users, and better monetizing users if the users are able to connect with their friends and bring their Facebook identity with them.At this point, we don't have any payments integrations with these mobile games, but our belief is that if we can help game developers to grow users' engagement and monetization, it puts us in an interesting position to consider future financial relationships. And the only other thing I would add is that we really launched or ramped up the mobile app install ads in the fourth quarter and are already seeing that that's a pretty promising way for developers to try and get better distribution for what they've built including games developers, and that's sort of a nice first step for us in trying to participate in the mobile gaming ecosystem.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Nomura. Your line is now open.Brian Nowak - NomuraThanks. I have two questions. First one, can you talk at all to some of the engagement trends you're seeing within the demos? Specifically what are you seeing in those younger post-college demos, are their engagement trends per user still rising or are they starting to show signs of leveling off? And then the second one is, when you look at your biggest categories of branded advertisers and where you’re at this point, what do you see is still the biggest near-term opportunities where Facebook and social budget share is still low and pretty underpenetrated relative to your larger categories? Thanks.David EbersmanIn terms of engagements, as we said, the overall engagement patterns will remain really strong for us. We don’t break out engagement metrics by self reported demographics like age. I think the one thing that we can say is that our view is that the overall marketplace is expanding really rapidly here in terms of just the amount of time people, college-age, post-college are spending connected, sharing with their friends, et cetera. And we think that’s great for Facebook and our long-term position, because we’re a leader in such a rapidly expanding market.Sheryl SandbergI’ll take the second part. We think we’ve really big opportunities across the board with the large brand spenders. If you just look at mobile, what you see, [Mary Meeker] (ph) just put out a report on this, mobile gets 1% of ad revenue and 10% of time consumed, and so right there, you see a big gap. Our opportunities there are to ramp with the large advertisers and build more deeply internal measurement systems so we can measure, help them use the Custom Audiences and other targeting we offer because right now still a lot of our advertisers aren’t using that targeting. So they are sending more generic ads to our whole system and that’s great. We have the scale to do that, but a better ad experience will take advantage of the targeting we offer.In mobile, we think we’re particularly really uniquely positioned. It’s not just that we have unprecedented scale and huge engagement that Mark talked about in his opening statement. We have a natural ad format. One of the big successes of 2012 was putting ads into News Feed and having them work, both for our clients on the marketing side, but also for our users engagement Mark talked about. On mobile because we’ve real identity and people are logged in, we’ve a really unique ability to serve relevant ads. And so I think particularly in the mobile area, we’re positioned in a very strong way compared to anyone else.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill LynchGreat. I have a couple of questions. It definitely seems the mobile ramp kind of slowed as the quarter progressed, obviously good numbers versus last quarter. Did you make an effort to maybe pull back some of the ad loads, or is there still a lot of opportunity to add more inventory in the mobile News Feeds as we look forward. And then secondly, maybe could you just comment on the health of the Payments business. It looks like the U.S. was up quarter-over-quarter even if we back out the extra month. So, was that some of the other new initiatives or did the gaming business get a little bit better in Q4? Thank you.David EbersmanOn the mobile side, I think that it's just really important to recognize we are very early in this. So, of course we’re still making changes in terms of what ads we show, how we select them, how many we show to different users and under different circumstances. So, this is still very early in the process of us trying to learn how to optimize that business as we develop it. Our perspective is that we’re still – we still have a lot of opportunity there. In terms of Payments, I think that what you said is generally true. Note that this year as opposed to last year we do have a little bit of revenue from non-game sources as I said, so you’ve got to sort of neutralize or back that out if you want to compare games-to-games year-over-year. But having said that, if you make the year-over-year comparison, we do as I said, we see – as I said earlier, we see a nice diversification happening in games, and it's a very interesting business to try and even think about projecting going forward, because some of the trends are really quite positive, but you have to be mindful of the macro trend that we’re not growing sort of the essence of this user base in the developed markets right now.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jordan Rohan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open.Jordan Rohan – Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.Thanks; I have a couple of questions. Any chance you can clarify more than just the impression volume metrics that you gave on FBX? Importantly, when do you anticipate mobile News Feed will be accessible through that platform. Separately, and given the promise of Gifts in eCommerce, why does it seem to be a business that you characterize as very small in the near term? What are the impediments to future growth, so that you could call it big enough to matter or an important part of 2013 revenue mix? Thank you.Sheryl SandbergOn the first one on FBX, when it's available, I don't know, but we just have nothing to share on that at this point.Jordan Rohan – Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.Okay, thanks.David EbersmanSecond question on Gifts, I think that I really can just reiterate what Mark said earlier, which is that the focus for right now is trying to figure out what the right product is. We think Gifts if done well can be a very natural and positive part of the Facebook experience. So, for example, when you're wishing someone a Happy Birthday, the ability to send a gift along with that, and just figuring out how the product needs to work, what the interfaces are, what the selection of products is, how the payment process works? All of that stuff is what we're going to have to optimize to make the product grow as you're asking, and we're going to try to do that and that will be something that we work on in 2013.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Your line is now open.Brian Pitz - Jefferies & Company, Inc.Thank you. Two questions. Mark, could you give us some examples of the kind of mobile-first experiences you're working on that you mentioned at the beginning of the call? And also any comments on how integration with iOS 6 is benefiting your overall mobile strategy? Thanks.Mark ZuckerbergI don't really think I can say any more about things that we're developing than directionally what I've already said. On iOS, I mean, there are two really big platforms out there today –there are three, I mean it's Android, iOS, and Mobile Web. Where we basically are -- the strategies for each of those are a bit different. So Mobile Web, there's a limit to how -- to the depths of how deep you can get into the system, but we can go as deep as anyone else. So, we feel pretty good about that and we think that our Mobile Web experience is really good and has on the same order of magnitude of users as our apps. So, that's actually really good.For Android, and then I'll get to iOS last -- Android is a very kind of dynamic and open platform as long as Google keeps it that way. There's actually – I mean, even though our relationship with Google isn't one where the companies really talk, we are able to do a bunch of things because they have an open platform that lets us get fairly deep into the system and build some really great experiences, which I think we will be -- which we're excited on about and we are working on them. I mean an example that we have already, that I can talk about is messenger, on Android you can build a messaging app that can actually do SMS on the phone, right? You can't do that on iOS because on iOS, iOS controls the SMS on the phone. But on Android, you can build something that does that and our messenger app does that. So that's a good kind of example of what we can do on Android.On iOS because it's a more lockdown system, the way that you can do deeper integrations is by working directly with Apple, right? And they've been a great partner for us so far and we're really excited about doing more there and people enjoy the integration that we have with them today to be able to share photos and share Web pages from anywhere across the experience when you're on your iPhone or iPad and we're really happy with it. So, I don't think that there is any meaningful numbers to share there but qualitatively, I think it's a really good experience and I'm really happy with the partnership that we have with them.Deborah CrawfordOperator, we have time for one last question.OperatorOkay. So your last next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Evercore Partners. Your line is now open.Kenneth Sena - Evercore PartnersThank you. Can you maybe give us some color behind your decision to lower the price on the pricing floor on the marketplace? And also, can I get just a clarification on FBX, are you doing about 1 billion impressions per day, and then also within the 22% mobile number, is there any FBX within that? Thank you.Sheryl SandbergOn the last we're doing -- you're correct, we're doing 1 billion impressions per day and FBX is not available now on mobile.David EbersmanOn the reserve price, we're always iterating and experimenting to optimize what we show for the user experience and for our business performance. The price floor has been something we've had in place. Its way below the average prices and the purpose of it has been to both support higher prices and limit poor quality ads. Over time, we've developed other tools that help us to achieve those objectives so the floor has become less important for us.Interestingly, there is some non-intuitive benefits also that we've been sort of realizing, which is that small businesses as you can imagine often create some of the highest quality and most highly engaging ads on Facebook. It makes sense because your local coffee shop feels like part of the community you live in and seeing an ad from them fits naturally into the experience that you want on Facebook. And small businesses are often the lowest bidders in our auction. So, by lowering  the floor, if we can bring in more small businesses into our network ,get them comfortable advertising with us, and hopefully ramp them up over time that should be a good thing. As I said, for the changes we happened to make this quarter, the impact was really primarily in international markets because the price floor really wasn’t coming into play in most of the developed markets anyway.Sheryl SandbergThat’s it. Thank you for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call.

Good afternoon. My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook third quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions)
Thank you very much. Ms. Deborah Crawford, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.
Deborah Crawford
Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Facebook’s third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our third quarter results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg COO; and David Ebersman, CFO.
Before we get started, I’d like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding the future events and the future financial performance of the company. We caution you to consider the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements in the press release and this conference call. These risk factors are described in our press release and are more fully detailed under the caption Risk Factors in our quarterly report on our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on July 31, 2012. In addition, please note that the date of this conference call is October 23, 2012, and any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of the new information or future events.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release.
This call is being broadcast on the Internet and is available on the Investor Relations section of the Facebook website at investor.fb.com. A rebroadcast of the call will be available after 6 p.m. Pacific time today. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are also available on our website. After management’s remarks, we will host a Q&A session.
And now I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Zuckerberg
Thanks, everyone, for joining us. I’m going to use this time today the same way I will use it on most of these calls, to talk about our vision and strategy.
Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. We do this by building services that give people the power to share whatever they want and stay connected to whomever they want, no matter where they are. For at least the next few years, there are three pillars to our strategy. First, we want to build the best and most ubiquitous mobile product. Second, we want to build a platform so that every new app that gets created can be social and enable people to share. And, third, we want to build a strong monetization and economic engine to build Facebook into one of the world’s most valuable companies.
I’m going to give an update on where we are in building each of these pillars. Let’s start with mobile. I think our opportunity on mobile is the most misunderstood aspect of Facebook today. Most people underestimate how fundamentally good the trend towards mobile can be for Facebook. This is because there are three trends that are kind of compounding together. First, mobile will give us the opportunity to reach way more people than desktop. Second, people on mobile use Facebook more often. And, third, long term, I think we’re going to monetize better per amount of time spent on mobile than desktop. All of these combined together make mobile a much larger opportunity for us than I think most people realize.
Now let’s go through each of these points. First, we should be able to reach more people on mobile than desktop. To us, this isn’t really controversial. In the coming years, there could be billions more smartphones than desktop computers. We already reach more than a billion people worldwide, including 600 million on mobile, growing quickly and up from 376 million last year. Facebook is the most widely downloaded app on basically every smartphone platform, so we’re well positioned to reach the growing smartphone population.
Second, people use our mobile app to visit Facebook more frequently. Somebody who uses only our desktop product has only a 40% likelihood of using Facebook on a given day, but someone who uses mobile has a 70% likelihood of using Facebook on a given day. This thought is surprising to many people and very good news for our opportunity on mobile. Another thing I’ve found encouraging is that we’ve shown that we can really increase mobile engagement.
Over the past year, a lot of people gave us feedback that our mobile apps were just too slow. So we took the time to rewrite them to make them faster. And since we released the new faster iOS app, we’ve seen an 80% increase in iOS News Feed loads and more than a 20% increase in iOS engagement in terms of likes and comments. We haven’t released the rewritten Android app yet, but we have many more updates on the way. So people on mobile are already more engaged than people on desktop, and there’s a lot more we can do to help drive deeper mobile engagement as well.
Third, as people spend more time using Facebook on mobile, the business question becomes how much money we can make from that time. I believe that over the long run we’re going to see more monetization per time spent on mobile than on desktop. Now, this isn’t proven yet, but we’re committed to getting there. The reason why I believe this is that on mobile, monetization has to be integrated deeply into our product. On desktop, we’ve built a multibillion-dollar business with ads on the side, separated from people’s primary experience.
But on mobile, we believe ads will be more like TV – high quality and integrated into the experience rather than off to the side. Mobile is a forcing function for us to rethink these experiences to be in mind. Since monetization needs to be integrated directly to the core product experience, I’ve now asked each product group to own the mobile monetization experience for their product. This is already unlocking a lot of ideas and creativity, and we’re starting to see higher-quality monetization experiences in terms of better ad products for people and better results for advertisers.
Finally, I want to dispel this myth that Facebook can’t make money on mobile. This may have seemed true earlier this year because we hadn’t started trying yet. Today, after just six months of ramping up our mobile ad business, we’re already at a point where 14% of our ad revenue this quarter is from mobile. That’s about $150 million. And the most important thing to understand here is that we’re just getting started with our mobile product development and monetization.
So on mobile, we have these three forces compounding together. We can reach more users, those users visit Facebook more often, and I think we will make more money. So I’m excited about this opportunity.
Next I want to talk about platform. At a high level, for our platform the last five to 10 years has been about getting everyone in the world connected and mapping out all the relationships between people. The next five to 10 years are going to be about all the apps and experiences that are now possible to build now that all these connections have already been mapped out. The social graph is a new sort of critical infrastructure for companies.
Since the majority of the people use their services are on Facebook, increasingly developers are building social apps. Today, eight of the top 10 iOS apps integrate with Facebook, and 40% of the top 400 apps use our SDKs. We believe that social apps will be the best products in every business category. In some categories, it may be an abrupt, disruptive, or revolutionary change, and in others, the change may be more subtle or roll out more slowly over time.
But over the next five to 10 years, we believe that the best products in every category will be social. We’ve already started seeing this, with media and Games, and in the future we expect to see this in areas like commerce and even finance. One question I often get is what’s our business here? As these apps get built and industries get transformed, why is this good for Facebook? We believe that over time, the more value we provide, the more revenue we’ll be positioned to get back, whether that’s through developers buying ads, running our ads through our network, using our Payments service, or other possible ways. We’re committed to building a sustainable and profitable platform.
Now, I want to talk specifically about Games for a bit, because I think the story here is a little misunderstood as well. Overall, gaming on Facebook isn’t doing as well as I’d like, but the reality is that there are actually two different stories playing out here. On the one hand, our Payments revenue from Zynga decreased by 20% this quarter compared to last year. But the interesting thing is that the rest of the Games ecosystem has actually been growing. Our monthly Payments revenue from the rest of the ecosystem increased 40% over the past year since Payments has been adopted. This evolution is pretty encouraging.
Additionally, I want to talk about Instagram. This is really a platform success story. We got to know them because they built a social integration with us that a lot of people really liked, and both companies saw the opportunity to do even more together. When we agreed to acquire them, Instagram had 27 million registered users. Today, they have more than 100 million. The most recent comScore reports show that in the U.S., there’s more mobile time spent on Instagram than on Twitter. By giving Instagram access to some of the tools we have internally here at Facebook, they can grow even faster than they would have alone.
Finally, I want to switch gears and talk a bit about monetization. The most important thing to understand here is that we’re just getting started on this. I’d like to mention a few of the monetization products I’m most excited about before handing it off to Sheryl to go into more detail on them.
We just rolled out a new product called Mobile App-Installs. Every developer wants more people to use their app. We can provide distribution to help developers increase discovery of their apps. I’m excited about this, because it helps developers with one of the biggest problems they face. I’m also excited about this because it’s truly a mobile-first ad product. A lot of what the desktop web is optimized to do is allow you to click from page to page, which just isn’t the basic behavior on mobile. On mobile, you have to install an app first, so installs are way more valuable. I’m excited to see how developers use our mobile app product.
We’ve also been rolling out Facebook Exchange and a product called Custom Audiences. The idea is that we want to improve our targeting capabilities so that it’s easier for marketers to reach their customers and so their ads are relevant and interesting to people on Facebook. This will create much better experiences for everyone using our product.
I’m also excited about the Gifts launch we’re in the early days of. I think there’s an opportunity here to bring more commerce to Facebook over time, and Gifts is a logical first step. People already send millions of birthday messages a day using Facebook, and a lot of them have asked to be able to do more. Gifts provides us with the opportunity to learn about how people buy things and will hopefully help us build better services in the future.
And of course beyond these products, there’s a lot more we plan to do. And I look forward to talking about those things on future calls. So thanks for taking the time to be here with us today and giving me an opportunity to report on how we’re doing in the three core areas our strategy: mobile, platform, and monetization. We have a lot going on right now, and I’m excited about the progress we’re making.
Sheryl Sandberg

Thanks, Mark. We made a lot of progress in our advertising business in the third quarter. Our total third quarter revenue was $1.26 billion, with $1.09 billion coming from advertising. This represents a 32% year-over-year increase in overall revenue and a 36% increase for advertising. With a billion people using Facebook monthly, we have created the largest, most engaged community of real people in the world. Building on this extraordinary asset, the goal of our advertising business is to transform how people and businesses connect. Our scale and targeting capabilities make Facebook increasingly important for marketers – brand marketers, direct marketers, local businesses, and developers – as they move customers all the way through the marketing funnel.
For brand marketers like Walmart and Procter & Gamble, Facebook offers the ability to reach customers, build awareness, and drive positive association, affinity, and consideration. We help brand marketers develop ongoing and often daily relationships with customers, in many cases for the first time. Facebook is starting to combine the science of CRM with the scale of brand marketing.
For direct marketers like Amazon and Capital One, working with Facebook can achieve high ROI by tapping into our incredibly accurate targeting capabilities. This represents a significant opportunity for us in a $55 billion global market. For the 12.8 million local businesses that already have Facebook pages, our products, including location and interest targeting and Offers, deepen customer relationships and drive sales. With tens of millions more local businesses around the world not yet on Facebook, we offer a simple path for SMBs to go digital and drive customers into their stores.
And for developers, we spur app downloads and installs and help them reengage customers to generate revenue. Facebook is uniquely positioned to succeed in this rapidly growing global market.
We believe that each of these market segments could over time become multibillion-dollar opportunities for us. To realize this potential, we’re focused on three priorities. One, building products that create value for every type of marketer. Two, demonstrating that value to marketers. And, three, taking advantage of the opportunity we have in mobile.
I’ll start with the first, products. In Q3, we increased our investment in monetization products. The result has been rapid innovation and new product introductions to serve each of the market segments more effectively. I will highlight four.
Custom Audiences, introduced in early September, helps marketers use their customer lists or other data to target Facebook ads in a privacy-protected way. This allows them to send the right message to the right person at the right time. For example, an automaker can advertise to customers who are looking to buy new car. We frequently see a match rate of over 50% and sometimes as high as 95%, which we believe to be much higher than industry norm.
In September, we expanded the rollout of FBX, the Facebook Exchange, which allows businesses to bid on specific impressions in real time. For example, if a customer visits a home-furnishing website to view a particular rug, the business can deliver Facebook ads to remind him that the rug is still available.
A month ago, we reintroduced Offers, which provides businesses a powerful new way to acquire new customers and drive loyalty. Every time someone claims an offer on Facebook, he or she creates a story that is shared with friends. Since launch, approximately 100,000 pages have created an offer, and approximately 30% of offer claims are coming from mobile devices.
Finally, we launched Promoted Posts, which make it easy to turn any page post into an ad. This simplicity is especially valuable for local businesses. Since launching in Q2, we have seen promoted posts from over 300,000 pages, over 25% of which are new advertisers to Facebook.
These new products enable marketers to achieve more of their objectives on Facebook. And more importantly, by improving the targeting and quality of our ads, we also create a better experience for our users.
But we know it’s not enough to roll out new products. Our second strategic priority is to prove the value of our products to marketers. Brand marketers increasingly recognize that they can have impact on Facebook similar to that on TV. Our daily reach is more than three times larger than the total viewing audience for this year’s Super Bowl, and it happens every day. Prominent brand marketers such as McDonald’s and Gerber have publicly recognize the high ROI Facebook delivers. We have shown that Facebook ads drive sales and ring cash registers. Based on studies of more than 60 campaigns, we learned that 70% of those campaigns showed a return on ad spend of three times or better, and 49% showed a return of five times or better.
Samsung Mobile USA’s experience demonstrates the value our ads deliver. Samsung used Facebook to build awareness of their new Galaxy S3 smartphone, reaching 105 million people and driving a 10-point lift in brand favorability among relevant customers. Even better, they determined that customers who saw the ads bought their new phone at an 85% higher rate than those who didn’t. As a result, the company realized more than $129 million in sales attributable to Facebook, nearly a 13x return on advertising spend.
Our new targeting capabilities, Custom Audiences and FBX, greatly increase the value Facebook provides direct marketers by significantly increasing efficiency through better precision. MGM Resorts International has been testing Custom Audiences to provide offers on hotel stays to repeat guests. After seeing returns on advertising spend range from 3x to 12x, they’re expanding their use of this product.
Initial results from beta partners show that FBX ads can achieve results equal to and often greater than those of other ad platforms. For example, MediaMath found their clients achieved 40% better performance on FBX than other platforms. Tell apart clients using FBX experienced a 10-times return on ad spend at a cost per acquisition comparable to other platforms.
Our other products are demonstrating similar results. Lawson, a leading convenience store chain in Japan, used Facebook Offers to advertise a discount on fried chicken. Over half a million people claimed the offer, 92% of whom did so from their mobile device, generating a 7x return on advertising spend. And Sam’s Chowder House, a local restaurant, used Promoted Posts to drive a 19% increase in both their number of guests – in both their monthly number of guests and monthly gross revenue.
Finally, I want to talk about our progress in mobile. Marketers want to reach mobile customers, because that’s where people are spending more of their time. We believe that no one is better positioned than we are to help marketers capitalize on the transition to mobile. Our mobile user base is huge, growing, and even more engaged than our desktop users. And, importantly, we deliver an experience that works for ads, since a significant portion of time on Facebook Mobile is spent using News Feed.
In Q3, we saw marketers embrace News Feed on both mobile and desktop as a growing part of their advertising strategies. This is driving results, given that page post ads in News Feed on both mobile and desktop are more than eight times as engaging as page post ads on the right-hand side. Advertisers are also seeing a 10x greater ad recall per impression. We see significant opportunity for future revenue growth from products and mobile News Feed, such as paid search ads and Mobile App-Install Ads, which we launched just last week. We also recently announced that we’re working with partners to test mobile ads and apps off of Facebook on both iOS and Android. We only started our mobile monetization efforts in March, and already in the third quarter, 14% of our advertising revenue came from mobile.
Many of the products I’ve highlighted in this are early in their history and will take time to generate revenue and scale, but our results to date suggest that we’re on the right track. We’re rapidly launching and scaling products that deliver value for marketers. We’re increasingly demonstrating the value that Facebook ads can deliver, and we have become one of the largest mobile advertising platforms in less than eight months.
Now I’ll hand it over to David.
David Ebersman
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to build on Mark and Sheryl’s comments and share our progress in the areas of user growth, revenue, and financial performance.
Let’s start with users. We ended September with 1.007 billion people using Facebook, up 26% from a year ago. 584 million people accessed Facebook each day on average in September, up 28% from the prior year. We grew monthly and daily users in all geographic regions, led by Brazil, India, and Japan. Mobile continues to drive our user growth, and we ended Q3 with 604 million monthly mobile users, up 61% versus last year. None of the user numbers include Instagram, which as Mark mentioned passed 100 million registered users and continues to grow.
We’re pleased that engagement patterns remain impressively strong around the world in terms of visitation as well as content shared and feedback created, as measured by likes and comments. We still see 58% of our monthly users coming back to Facebook each day, even with more than a billion people using Facebook, including later adopters, and despite a constantly evolving competitive environment. This speaks to the value of our service and the strength of our network.
Now turning to revenue. As Sheryl said, total revenue was up 32% from last year, and ads revenue was up 36%. If exchange rates had stayed constant, total revenue would’ve increased 38% and ad revenue 43%. Over the first two quarters of 2012, our ad revenue growth with constant exchange rates was 38% and 33%, so our Q3 number of 43% demonstrates we’re seeing positive impact from our recent investments in monetization. Ad revenue growth was driven by a 27% increase in the number of ads delivered and a 7% increase in the average price per ad. The increase in ads delivered is similar to the year-over-year rate of user growth, as the reduction in ads per user from engagement shifting to mobile was generally offset by product changes that increased ad inventory.
In terms of ad price changes versus last year, the 7% increase was driven primarily by the ramping up of ads in News Feed, as these ads continue to have higher levels of user engagement as measured by click rates and therefore a higher price per ad compared to ads in the right-hand column. In the U.S. and Canada, where the shift to mobile continues rapidly, price per ad increased by 20% relative to last year. And price per ad also increased significantly in Asia and rest of world. Europe remains challenging, with price per ad down from a year ago.
Payments and other fees revenue in the third quarter totaled $176 million, up 13% from last year but down 9% compared to the second quarter, driven by a decline in payments from Zynga. Payments revenue from non-Zynga developers in aggregate continued to grow from Q2 to Q3. In Q3, Zynga represented 43% of our Payments revenue, down from 51% in Q2 and 62% in Q3 last year.
Including its ad spend, Zynga comprised 7% of our total revenue this quarter, down from 10% in Q2 and 12% in Q3 last year. An additional reminder on Payments: In Q4, we plan to recognize revenue from four months of Payments transactions, for accounting reasons noted in our last 10-Q and repeated on slide 10 of the earnings slides on our website. In terms of revenue per user, worldwide ARPU increased 4% versus Q3 2011. North America and rest of world ARPU increased by around 20% each, while Europe and Asia ARPU each increased by a few percent, with Europe negatively affected by exchange rate changes.
Turning now to expenses. Our Q3 GAAP expenses were $885 million, an increase of 64% from last year. Excluding the effect of stock comp, our remaining expenses increased 57% to $737 million, driven by head count growth and investments in infrastructure. We ended the quarter with just over 4,300 employees, a quarter-over-quarter increase of 9%. We plan to continue to invest aggressively in the business in Q4, with a sharp focus on the three priorities Mark described.
We view the product development investments we’re making in mobile and platform as critical to drive continued user growth and deepen engagement and to grow our strategic importance for developers and advertisers. We’re also investing more in monetization in order to build out and improve the products we offer advertisers and also to fund new initiatives such as Gifts. We had GAAP operating income of $377 million in the third quarter. Including the effects of stock comp, our operating income was $525 million, representing a 42% non-GAAP operating margin.
Our GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 116%, driven by the unusual amount of stock comp this year, a portion of which is not tax deductible. Excluding the effect of stock comp, our non-GAAP tax rate was 40%. For Q4, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be similar to Q3 before our GAAP tax rate returns to more typical levels in 2013.
The amount of cash tax we pay will be significantly different from the tax provision I just described due to deductions from vesting of RSUs and exercise of options. At today’s stock price, we estimate tax deductions of over $10 billion that will reduce our cash tax payments in 2012 and in the future. Driven by our tax provision in Q3, we reported a GAAP net loss of $59 million or $0.02 per share. Excluding stock comp and its tax effects, we had a non-GAAP net income of $311 million or $0.12 per share.
Turning to cash metrics, we purchased $171 million of property and equipment in Q3 and acquired another $161 million of equipment financed through capital leases. For 2012, we expect to come in at the low end of the CapEx range we provided last quarter, which was $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. In Q3, we also paid $300 million upon closing the Instagram acquisition, and we ended Q3 with $10.5 billion in cash and investments. In Q4, RSUs that we granted employees between 2007 and 2010 will vest and settle for the first time.
On the vesting dates, we’ll withhold from employees approximately 120 million shares, and we’ll pay income taxes for the employees. The total tax payments will equal the value of the 120 million shares on the vesting dates or approximately $2.4 billion at today’s stock price. As we previously disclosed, we expect to fund the tax payments from cash on hand and our amended term loan facility. After the withholding dates, the 120 million shares will no longer be considered outstanding for accounting purposes, reducing our shares that are used to calculate EPS.
In closing, we’re pleased with our business progress over the past few months and how we’re positioned for the future. We’re excited about the product development investments we’re making in order to build out better and deeper social experiences for the people who use Facebook, and we’re focused on executing on our advertising, Payments, and new business opportunities to translate our product successes into a strong and valuable business.
Now let’s open the call for questions.

Justin Post – Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Great. A couple questions for you on mobile. First, can you talk about total engagement as you look at individual users, both on PC and mobile? Are you seeing that engagement grow if you add up both in minutes or likes or other metrics? Can you talk about total engagement of your user base and how that’s trending? And then thanks for the mobile disclosure, 14% of revenues. Can you say – last quarter you gave us kind of how you were ending the quarter. Can you say if that mobile was kind of accelerating as the quarter progressed? Thank you.
David Ebersman

Sure. I can take both those questions. So first of all, in terms of engagement on mobile and web, we continue to see that content created is growing across the world, and feedback, which we measure in terms of likes and comments, continues to grow well as well. So the engagement story on Facebook continues to be a strong one that we’re pleased about.
In terms of the sort of Feed revenue, at the end of the second quarter, we disclosed that at that point we were running at about $1 million a day, and we used that metric because we’d just started ramping up towards the end of the quarter, so we felt like giving you the numbers for the whole quarter was not representative of where we were. Those numbers continued to ramp through the quarter. We ended the third quarter with more than $4 million a day coming from Feed and about three-quarters of that coming from mobile Feed. But going forward, I think we’ll stick to the metric of mobile as a percentage of revenue.

Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Gene Munster – Piper Jaffray

Good afternoon, and maybe just following up on Justin’s question, can you talk – obviously you guys have been putting the pedal to the metal, and I think, Dave, you just kind of gave some metrics around the impact to the overall experience. But first question is, is there anything that makes you believe that the acceleration in mobile is impacting the experience? And second, can you talk about any sort of cannibalization from the desktop to mobile in terms of ad revenue?
Sheryl Sandberg

Yeah, I can take this. We’re carefully monitoring user engagement and sentiment, and we’re pleased with the results so far. We look at how users are engaging on our platform. And as we’ve increased the number of ads in News Feed, we’ve been carefully monitoring that engagement. Our revenue’s growing, and that means, as I discussed, we have a lot of new clients. We also have a lot of clients and customers who are spending more with us. So we’re seeing increased revenue and increased budgets from them. Some of the revenue also is moving over from the right-hand column to News Feed, and that’s part of our strategy. We are putting more emphasis on the products that are running through News Feed, rolling out products, because that’s where the natural ad format is for mobile.
Operator

Next we have the line of Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Once again, Mr. Devitt with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Next we have Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Youssef Squali – Cantor Fitzgerald

So I was just wondering if you can maybe give us some examples of instances where you guys are already seeing better monetization on mobile than on desktop. And, David, can you just quantify the contribution of Instagram in the quarter, both top and bottom line, if possible?
Sheryl Sandberg

We’ve been working on ad products that monetize on mobile, as I said, into News Feed. And so one example of a product that’s uniquely mobile is Mobile App-Install Ads that Mark mentioned and I mentioned as well. That’s an experience that’s uniquely mobile, and it’s a good example of an ad product that really works in that format.
David Ebersman

In terms of Instagram, we closed the acquisition towards the end of the third quarter, so the impact was next to zero, certainly zero on the top line, and next to zero on the bottom line. In the fourth quarter, we will have expenses both from the employees and the investments we’re making in Instagram and also the amortization of the intangible assets that we acquire.
Sheryl Sandberg

And to add one more thought on monetization on mobile versus desktop, which I think is the heart of the question, if we’re measuring engagement and the results from page post ads, comparing them when they’re placed on the right-hand side to those that are being placed in News Feed. And comparatively, the ones in News Feed – and that’s on both mobile and desktop – are eight times more engaging, and we see 10 times the ad recall. And that makes sense, because News Feed is where a lot of the engagement on Facebook takes place, so by moving those promoted posts or page posts into News Feed, we’re increasing engagement and results as well.
Youssef Squali – Cantor Fitzgerald

Thank you.
Operator

Next we have Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heather Bellini – Goldman Sachs

Great. Thank you very much. I had a question for Mark. I guess I was wondering, given the monetization products that you mentioned at the start of the call, if you could maybe rank-order for us – how would you rank those in terms of their ability to drive revenue in calendar 2013, and which ones should be watching most closely? Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg

Yeah, I mean, I look at it in terms of we’re building a lot more integrated ad products now, right? And if you look at where we were historically, most of the ad inventory was in this right-hand column. It was a separate experience. And we had this ad team and their job was to kind of drive that service, and they could provide that service to every other product team. So the Messages team focuses on building the best Messages product, and now when they can run that on the side to make money.
Now what we’re basically doing is we’ve told every product team that they’re responsible for the advertising experience within each of their products, so the News Feed team is coming up with better ad experiences than just being able to run kind of general ads on the side. And what we’re seeing is that across each of these consumer products that we have, we’re just getting more tailored advertising experiences. So I think there are multiple ways to look at it. I mean, you can look at it by market segment for advertisers, or you could look at it by consumer product; that tends to be how I look at more. But I mean whether it’s a News Feed or the mobile apps that we’re building, or Timeline or any of these things, I think we’re just going to see a lot better products for both users and advertisers.
Operator

Our next question is from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Scott Devitt – Morgan Stanley

Okay, great. We got it this time. And, sorry, I got cut off, so if you’ve answered, just pass. But, Mark, you mentioned ad network in your commentary, and you also discussed search as a business opportunity for Facebook in the middle of the quarter at an event. And so just wonder if you could talk a little bit more about those opportunities in terms of the approach that you would take to build businesses such as that. And then secondly, David, you mentioned changes in the ad product as a driver for growth in ads served, and what were those changes that were made? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg

Sure. So on platform, the basic approach that we have is we think that almost every product category is going to get transformed in some capacity, some abrupt, some kind of subtle transitions over time, where we think that at the end of this process, the winning products in every category are going to be social ones. And one question that I get frequently is just how, if we enable companies to build better products, how does Facebook make money from that? And I think it’s a fair and good question, because then we have to build our platform in a sustainable and profitable way.
But rather than focusing too early on, on trying to figure out exactly what the economic relationship is going to be with each of these partners, what we’re primarily focused on is just enabling these companies to grow. And the basic idea is that there are many different ways that we make money from the different platform partners, right? So most of the companies that develop with us – probably shouldn’t say most – but a lot of them buy a lot of ads with us, right, and are some of our biggest advertisers, if you look at the list of advertisers. We’re running a few tests now where on mobile apps and on desktop, some developers are running our ads on their sites, and that’s another way that we can get a revenue share and can get some revenue and profit from these developers growing in engagement.
We obviously have the Payments system as well, so developers can integrate that, and we take a cut of that. And there may be other ways in the future that make sense as well that we can talk to developers about exploring. But the basic idea is that we are first focused on helping developers transform these categories, and then we believe that there are going to be a number of different ways of that that revenue can come back to us.
David Ebersman

So, Scott, you were asking about the comments I made that in the quarter, this quarter, the number of ads we showed grew at a similar rate to user growth after – in the recent past we’ve been growing ads more slowly because of the shift to mobile, and the product changes helped to offset that. So one product change, for example, would be in this quarter we showed ads in News Feed on both mobile and personal computers, and the year-ago quarter we didn’t. We have made other changes through the period of time, several of which I think had a positive impact on the number of ads we show per page on personal computer use.

Next we have the line of Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler – Deutsche Bank

Great. Just two quick questions. First for Mark on the platform, one of the things we all hope to see Facebook do one day is kind of monetize your strong distribution without touching the user experience with ads. We assume that you guys have thought about this quite a bit, so is there any strategy in the works where you guys could potentially charge for API calls or something that isn’t related to the advertising products? And then, David, a question about the geographic revenue mix. So most of the ad acceleration happened in the U.S. Most of your other regions on a local FX basis decelerated a little bit. So have the new mobile ads been rolled out in those other regions yet, or is that a catalyst that we will see in the coming quarters? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg

Well, I’ll just talk a bit about how we’re thinking about platform monetization. One of the reasons why we favor approaches like having developers buy ads or run our ads or accept payments is that we end up getting a portion of revenue or the value that’s created, as opposed to if you were doing something that was tied to our cost spend, then that’s – it’s a less-efficient way to get value for that value that we’re helping other folks create. So it’s definitely something that we think about.
But, again, one theme that I talked about earlier was how each product group now is in charge of the ads experience for that product, and what you’re seeing the platform team build are things like Mobile App-Installs, which is an advertising product for providing distribution for developers, and that’s one of the things that I’m really excited about. It’s a mobile-first product, it’s for developers, a lot of folks who aren’t traditionally Facebook developers still want to spread their apps on mobile, so I think it has a lot of potential.
David Ebersman

In terms of the geographic mix for our advertising revenue, the new products that are most important to us, or were most important in the third quarter, which is the ads in News Feed, are adopted or were adopted more quickly by our U.S. clients than globally, and that’s what we would expect just given how these things tend to play out. But if you look at ad revenue year over year across the world, actually Asia and rest of world grew at a faster rate than the U.S. did, and Europe grew a little bit more slowly. So while I do think the U.S. has grown more in terms of dollars because the base is bigger, we’re pleased with how we’re growing across the world with, again, Europe lagging a bit more than we’d like.
Operator

Next we have the line of Mark Mahaney with Citi. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney – Citi

Great, thanks. I hate to ask about desktop, but I will. It looks like the desktop ad revenue actually declined sequentially. Is that just normal seasonality, FX, or is there any color there? I’d assume that you’d expect that to normally grow sequentially? And then could you talk about where you think advertisers are in terms of developing good creative for sponsored story ads? We’ve seen mixed success in kind of the ads we’ve tried to track to date. Do you feel that that’s a process, six-month, 12-month process, of advertisers really coming to grips with the most effective way to display those ads? I know it’s a – you have to do work, they have to do work. Where do think the advertisers are in doing the work to help that product? Thank you.
David Ebersman

I’ll take the first one. I don’t think the desktop trend is a seasonal one. I think that we opened up a lot of inventory on mobile in this quarter, and so we had advertisers who shifted some spend that might’ve been on the desktop computer into mobile feeds, because our relationships with advertisers – they’re not different advertisers on the two sets of devices, so I think that’s the trend you’re seeing there.
Sheryl Sandberg

On the question of where advertisers are, as I said before, we’re a third thing, we’re not TV, we’re not search. We are social advertising. And I would say our clients are in different parts of that adoption curve. We have clients who have done a lot with us. They’ve now increasingly, especially this year, seen the results and seen how it affects their actual in-store sales. And they really understand it, and they’re doing more and more. We have some clients who haven’t done as much and haven’t quite figured out how to do this. And I think it’s going to be a slow but steady progression. We see more people doing more and understanding how to make social ads really work for them.
We’re also working hard at developing better tools. So some of the things we’re announcing and working with – if you think about Custom Audiences, Custom Audiences enables you, an advertiser, to segment to different parts of their customer segment different ads. That’s really important for making those ads perform better as well. And all the work we’re doing on measuring is also really important, because by measuring, we not just prove the results we have to marketers, but we then get results, which we can then use to improve the ads.
Operator

Next we have the line of Jordan Rohan with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Jordan Rohan – Stifel Nicolaus

Thank you so much. I hope this question comes across okay. Click-through rates may indeed be high on the Feed. I’m curious if you’re able to measure how many of these clicks are accidental and intentional or due to the smaller form factor of smartphones? Put another way, do you see difference between the click-through rates in the Feed between small-form-factor handsets, which are mobile, and larger-form-factor tablets, which may also be considered mobile, but where one could see fewer fat-finger clicks? Separately, do you have any feel for post-click conversion rate metrics that could enable an advertiser to equate the value of a click from Facebook, whether it’s mobile, desktop, or wherever, and a click from Google or – and how you think about that?
David Ebersman

I think on the first question, I mean, there are inadvertent clicks on every platform for every company that shows advertising, so it’s just something for us to continue to be aware of and monitor, but I don’t think it’s a specific issue to Facebook, and I do think over time it’s the kind of issue we’ll be able to make good progress at managing.
Sheryl Sandberg

On the second question, which is basically the efficacy and the value the ads provide, it really depends upon what the different products are and what people are measuring. We are seeing our products create great value and create increasing value in many cases for our customers. But different people are measuring different things. So with brand advertisers, they’re looking for a brand lift, all the brand metrics people look at, ad recall, affinity, and then sales, which we’ve just started the process of measuring this year. With other advertisers like Mobile App-Installs, they’re looking for those mobile apps to be installed, and we’re measuring all of those across the spectrum.
Operator

Next we have the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Doug Anmuth – JP Morgan

Great, thanks. Just wanted to ask two questions. First, just going back to ads in the News Feed, can you talk about where you think you are now in terms of coverage and inventory levels versus where you could potentially be going forward? Just trying to get an understanding here for how much more gains there are from inventory versus advertisers, more advertisers coming on board and driving pricing up higher? And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the early benefits that you might be seeing from the Facebook Ad Exchange, how much inventory has been opened up here, and is there any chance that the Ad Exchange can help stabilize the sequential desktop declines that you’re seeing? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg

On the mobile ads, as you’ve seen, we’ve definitely put a lot more ads into Feed as part of growing the mobile revenue. I think you’ll see us increasingly put ads in Feed as well, but there’s a lot of growth that comes not from just more ads in Feed, but from better ads in Feed. Every time an ad is more targeted, more relevant, the marketer gets better value, and it’s better for the people in Feed. And if you look at the types of ads we have in Feed, while we’re really pleased with the progress of increasing our mobile revenue, we also think we have a long way to go in making those ads better, more relevant, higher value. And we’re at the very beginnings of that. We’re measuring across all our different ad products the value they provide for marketers and people, and I think you’ll see a lot of progress in quality, and we believe that progress in quality will translate to revenue as well.
On the Facebook Ad Exchange, it’s really early. We just took the Facebook Ad Exchange out of beta in September. We’re not really seeing breakdowns of how much each product is generating in terms of revenue, but that one is small, and we are going to scale each product as we feel comfortable that they’re a great experience for people and for our marketers.
Operator

Next we have the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.
Brian Wieser – Pivotal Research

Thanks for taking the question. Can you dimensionalize the nature of your advertiser base between small advertisers versus large brands that work with agencies? And secondarily, can you talk through the geography of the advertisers, not the users, but how the breakdown diverges? And specifically with mobile, is much of it coming from the U.S. versus internationally? Thank you.
Sheryl Sandberg

When we think about the four key marketer segments we have – brand, direct, local businesses, and developers – they’re all very important to our revenue in advertising. And they’re important in different ways. The brand advertisers are really important for the engagement they drive and the reach that they’re buying and the sales they’re able to generate. The direct marketers, as we’ve done more with FBX, Custom Audiences, those products work across the board, but they’re particularly important for direct marketers.
The local business story is a very good one this quarter. We’ve long believed, and I’ve long believed, that this is the Holy Grail of the Internet, that local businesses have the ability to really generate a lot of revenue and provide a lot of value for the people who see those ads. But it’s just really hard to get local businesses online. We’ve had great numbers of local businesses who are using our free products. We have 12.8 million have Facebook pages, 8 million of them use that page monthly, and over 3.5 million post weekly.
But what you saw this quarter with the launch of Promoted Posts is a really big step function in converting those people who are using our free page product into paying customers. With over 300,000 pages using Promoted Posts, 25% – more than 25% of those are from new advertisers. So we’ve always had this thesis that people will use our free products and then as we roll out products that are easy and simple for local businesses, we’ll see broad adoption. And I think we really saw that here.
And with developers, we continue to iterate on both the Payments side and the advertising site. We think Mobile App-Install Ads – this is very early and I want to stress how early it is – but they’re also very promising.
David Ebersman

In terms of advertising revenue by geography, the discussion I’ve provided thus far was by user geography. You were asking about where the revenue is attributed if you focus on where the advertiser comes from, where we’re going. As you would imagine, the revenue is going to skew more to the developed world in that kind of a comparison, because you have large global companies that are trying to advertise to users throughout the world, more than you have people in developing markets who are trying to reach people in the United States, for example. So if you were to pick the U.S. as an example, the by-advertiser attribution of our ad revenue to the U.S. is going to be considerably – maybe not considerably but a bit higher than if you look at it by attribution in terms of user geography.
Operator

Next we have the line of Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research. Your line is open.
Daniel Ernst – Hudson Square Research

Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. Mark, sort of a big-picture question for you. As you’ve transitioned to more of a mobile environment where on the web, Facebook is essentially a platform that applications run on, to the mobile environment, where Facebook for the most part is an application that runs on other people’s platforms, whether it’s Apple or Android from Google.
And how does that change the opportunity, the way you look at the business long term? And as a related matter to that, as you look to monetize the Open Graph network with so many applications and websites that link into you, what do you see as the opportunity to begin to push the ad network beyond mobile into other websites and use your social data to actually push ads outside the network? And could that be a business that takes a life of its own above advertising on your own, by itself? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg

Yeah, I think it’s a good question. And this is why in my opening remarks I spent a bunch of time talking about how I think that in this counterintuitive way, I think a lot of folks have the question that you have of whether the fact that iOS or Android are these mobile platforms, is that a worse environment for Facebook? And I think what we’ve found that is because of these three compounding factors – more users, more time spent, and the ability to have more monetization, which we’re not there yet, but we think we’re going to get there – that we’re actually much better positioned on mobile than we were on desktop before. And I think some of the trends and data points that we’re laying out here today kind of start constructing that case a bit more.
In terms of the actual platform, we’re really an information-sharing platform. We never were an environment for running apps, right? Even on desktop, when you have these games that are very deeply connected to Facebook, they’re not building in some kind of Facebook environment. They’re basically building websites that connect with Facebook and make it so you can pull your friends in and then use Facebook for distribution and sharing. So what I see on mobile is I don’t think that developers are going to be building apps that are literally inside the Facebook app. But what we do see is a lot of success in getting developers to connect their apps to Facebook.
So I mentioned these stats where eight of the top 10 iOS apps are connected to Facebook, and 40% of the top 400 iOS apps have the Facebook SDK and are using that in some capacity. So to me, that’s a good sign. And we don’t directly compete with iOS or Android to be a platform for developers as an environment for building apps. And we think that we can basically build an environment, or build this information platform that goes across iOS and Android and mobile web and every other mobile platform that’s out there where every developer who’s building anything on any of those can use Facebook. And we think that that puts us in a really strong position.
Operator

Next we have the line of Rory Maher with Capstone Investments. Your line is open.
Rory Maher – Capstone Investments

Thanks. First question’s for Mark, and then I have one for Sheryl. A lot of the call has been taken up by creating better monetization products for some of your advertisers. And I’ve been hearing recently about some kind of juxtaposition between user rules and advertising rules. And I know a lot of people point towards the Burger King ad that the app got pulled because people were de-friending people. I’m just curious, is improving -kind of making that process more clear, is that part of your strategy to kind of build out more monetization products? And how do you manage between that and your users? And then Sheryl, you said, I think – I don’t want to misquote, but I think the payments from Zynga were down about 20%. Other games were up about 43%. Did we see similar movements in advertising from games on your platform to acquire users?
Sheryl Sandberg

Just starting off with the Burger King, that Burger King thing, if I’m thinking of the right thing, was many, many years ago. It was an old app that was -
Mark Zuckerberg

It was violating our policy.
Sheryl Sandberg

It was violating our policies by encouraging people to de-friend. I literally think it might’ve been two or three years ago. That’s long gone.
But in terms of the balance between good experiences for users and good experience for marketers, we don’t think these are in conflict. We really think they work together. When an advertisement is better for people because they like it better, it also creates more value for marketers. And so our strategy going into that strategic priorities we have is to build products that create value for all of these marketers, measure that value, make it all work on mobile. And we’re not really trading off the user experience versus the marketers’ experience when we do this well. When we do this well, we launch products like Offers that see broad adoption and see people passing it off to their friends.
In the Offers example, since launch just this quarter, 100,000 pages created an offer. And of our top 100 offers, on average three-fourths were done by non-fans. That means that people are passing this through the social ecosystem, and their friends are finding it valuable. That’s an experience that’s great for people and great for marketers.
David Ebersman

To answer your question about Zynga – or I guess about really advertising in general – as our Games ecosystem has become more diversified in terms of the companies who are doing well, generating Payments revenue for us, we would imagine and do see a – also diversification of ad spend from those developers.
Deborah Crawford

So, operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator

Our final question, then, will come from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays. Your line is open.
Anthony DiClemente – Barclays

Thank you very much. Sheryl, just wondering, if you could point to any particular success stories on sources of off-line demand generation ad dollars that maybe you could point to? I imagine early on a lot of the sources would be from online, be it display or fulfillment. But is there anything, for example, like print media dollars moving over from newspapers or magazines or otherwise? And then another question on the competitive environment, perhaps for Mark. Just wondering what you’re seeing in terms of users and engagement in international markets where there are other social media platforms that are – any comments there? Is Facebook complementary in some of those markets? And how are you seeing kind of local behavior in terms of users and engagement? Thanks.
Sheryl Sandberg

To your first question, which is where the budgets are moving from as Facebook revenue increases, it’s really client by client, account by account, how people are doing their spend. We do know that every time we compete for a dollar of advertising, we’re competing against every other opportunity a customer has, whether that’s off-line or online. And our goal is to compare really favorably across all of those.
I think the way we’re really doing that now is by putting more products into the market that do a better job of serving the different needs of our different market segments. I think one question people have had is, God, you guys are rolling out so many products. Why? And why are you doing that? And how does that all tie together? And for us, we’re very clear. We have four market segments. We have three priorities. But we need multiple products to serve those different market segments, and that’s what you’re seeing from us. And I think that’s what enables us to compete against all the other advertising opportunities out there.
David Ebersman

In terms of the competition, I mean, we compete in all markets for user attention and time and things like that, and the competition looks different from market to market. So it’s sort of hard to give you a blanket answer to that question.
Deborah Crawford

Good afternoon. My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Crawford, you may begin your conference call.
Deborah Crawford
Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Facebook's first earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our second quarter results are: Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and David Ebersman, CFO.
Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. We caution you to consider the important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements in the press release and this conference call. These risk factors are described in our press release and are more fully detailed under the caption Risk Factors in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on May 18, 2012.
In addition, please note that the date of this conference call is July 26, 2012, and any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. This call is being broadcast on the Internet and is available on the Investor Relations section of the Facebook website at investor.fb.com. A rebroadcast of the call will be available after 6:00 p.m., Pacific Time, today. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are also available on our website. After management's remarks, we will host a Q&A session.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Zuckerberg
Thank you, Deborah. And thanks to everyone listening for joining Facebook's first earnings call as a public company. We appreciate having the opportunity to speak directly to all of you and to share our perspective on how we're doing in fulfilling our mission of making the world more open and connected. Hopefully, you'll come away from today's call with a clear sense of the investments we're making to create value over the long term by making Facebook even more useful for all of the people who use our services worldwide.
We ended June with 955 million monthly active users, over 1/2 of whom used Facebook on a daily basis and over 1/2 of whom used Facebook for mobile devices. We saw more people using our services at the end of June than at the end of March across all key countries, including 3 million more people in the U.S. Growing the network of people who use Facebook and expanding the social experiences available to them remains the foundation of our efforts and the key to our future success.
I'm going to focus the rest of my comments today on our top priorities across our product areas for 2012, specifically mobile, platform and social ads.
Let's start with mobile. Mobile is a huge opportunity for Facebook. Our goal is to connect everyone in the world. And over the next 5 years, we expect 4 billion to 5 billion people to have smartphones. That's more than twice as many people that have computers today. So building great services for these devices is essential for us to help people connect. We also think that people are inherently social, and having a device with you wherever you are creates more opportunities for sharing and connecting.
We're finding that people are quickly adopting our mobile services. As of the end of June, 543 million people were actively using our mobile services every month, each month. That's 67% more people than the 325 million who were using our mobile services just a year ago. We've also found that people who use our mobile services are more active Facebook users than people who only use our desktop services. On average, mobile users are around 20% more likely to use Facebook on any given day. So mobile not only gives us the potential to connect more people with our services, but it also gives us the ability to provide more value and a more deeply engaging experience.
We don't just want to have the most widely used mobile apps, though. We want to build the best apps and we also want to build experiences that are as deeply integrated as possible into every device and mobile app that people use. We're investing very heavily in improving our mobile apps, primarily across iOS, Android and the mobile Web. This involves building out world-class teams with competencies in different technical stacks, making significant investments in improving the technical foundation of our apps and designing new products and integrating into these mobile systems as deeply as we can.
We've made some good progress from the past quarter as we released our Camera app, shipped new releases of Messenger, shipped 2 releases of our Android app, agreed to acquire Instagram and worked with Apple to integrate Facebook into their upcoming release of iOS. Going forward, you should expect to see a frequency of improvement to each of these mobile experiences.
Finally, we're also beginning to demonstrate that we can advertise effectively within the mobile experience. I'll discuss social ads more in a minute. But at a high level, our Sponsored Stories, which we launched in mobile News Feed earlier this year, have grown quickly and demonstrated early success.
Now let's shift to platform. We believe one of the biggest opportunities we have is to create the identity and social layer that all new apps and websites can be built on top of. We think almost every product is better when you can experience it with the people you care about. So over time, we expect almost all of these products should naturally become social. Since there's no way we could ever build all of these ourselves, we're focused on building a successful platform, which enables developers to build great social experiences into their own apps by integrating with and exchanging information with Facebook.
Our platform strategy enables millions of developers to build better products and helps us provide a lot of value to the people who use Facebook. We've already seen how social dynamics can transform industries, like gaming, and we believe other industries, like music, are starting to follow as well. Our goal is to make it easy for developers to build these social apps. We do this in 2 ways: first, by enabling people to sign in to apps using Facebook and thereby bringing their real identities, friends and other information to the apps so that the apps can offer a more personalized experience; and second, by enabling people to share what they're doing in these apps to their friends back on Facebook so these apps can get accessed to our distribution and they can scale and grow quickly.
Today, you could download Spotify, log in with Facebook and immediately see our music player light up with songs your friends are listening to and recommending. We can imagine a day when you buy a new car and by logging into the car's computer with Facebook, you can similarly have it immediately light up music, addresses, restaurants, stores and other destinations targeted specifically for you based on your friends and your interests.
We believe social products like this will provide better experiences. But if we're right, then Facebook is in a unique place to enable these experiences to get built. It's worth calling out that our vision for platform is bigger than what most people perceive. We believe our platform is about bringing social context to apps and providing distribution for apps regardless of what environment they're built in, including mobile apps, websites or on our own Canvas on our own website. When many people think about our platform, they think only about games that are built inside of the Facebook website directly and not all of the other kinds of apps that developers can build.
Our Open Graph platform is what we call the tools we've launched last year that enable developers to easily integrate more kinds of actions and experiences with Facebook. Open Graph has already been adopted by many of the most popular websites and mobile apps. Many of the top apps in the iOS and Android app stores are integrated with Facebook. Apps like Spotify, Netflix, Pinterest, foursquare, Instagram, Airbnb, Tumblr, VeeHD, Nike+, SongPop and thousands more have integrated with Open Graph to provide better social experiences and grow their user bases. Already people are sharing nearly 1 billion pieces of content each day using Open Graph.
These Open Graph integrations enable Facebook users to share more of the content they want with their friends. This helps make our service more engaging overall since there's more content to consume. Additionally, we found that our largest developers also tend to become our largest advertisers as they look to further boost the distribution they're getting from us.
We're still in the early days of our Open Graph effort, and we're continually working to improve how it works. A big focus for us right now is giving people more tools to control how they share their information using these integrations. We're also working on improving the distribution that these apps get in exchange for the content they help people share. These are some complex problems that will take time to work out, but you should expect us to make steady progress towards building out this ecosystem.
Finally, I'd like to discuss our social ads initiatives. The basic idea here is that the best type of advertising is a message from a friend. Facebook wants to offer advertisers the best tools to create ads that are social. We believe that the more our advertising include interesting content from people you care about, the more marketers will be able to create advertising that adds value to people's experience on Facebook. Advertisement on Facebook today is already delivering a compelling ROI, even though most advertising on Facebook today isn't social. We believe the experience can be better and more social. For experience -- for example, if I like a restaurant, then my friends might see that I like that place, and that's likely a more convincing ad than anything the restaurant would produce on its own. That's an example of aligning social activity in ads. One important aspect of social ads is that since they're based on social activity, they've been to our News Feed product on both mobile and desktop. This is important because mobile users already spend so much time reading their News Feed. So these social ads in News Feed give us a clear path to building a strong business on mobile.
I mentioned earlier that we recently began to roll out our Sponsored Stories in both desktop and mobile News Feed. By the end of June, Sponsored Stories in News Feed was at a run rate of over $1 million per day in revenue and about 1/2 of that is coming from mobile. This is an encouraging start in our effort to generate revenue from the mobile use of Facebook. We know that social ads perform much better than nonsocial ads, so our job over the next few years is to increase the percentage of ads that are social and engaging.
Overall, I hope my comments here give you a good sense of our priorities around mobile, platform and social ads. We have a lot of interesting things going on here. There are a lot of challenges and these are the types of problems that we like to work on. We're working hard to staff up across the company, especially in the technical groups, to make sure we make progress against these goals.
We just announced we've begun recruiting engineers to work in our London office to help us access talent across Europe. We're pleased that the company and culture are centered on building great products and around our mission to make the world more open and connected.
Thanks, again, for taking the time to be on the call with us today. And now I'd like to hand it over to Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg
Thanks, Mark. I'm going to focus today on Facebook's opportunities in the advertising market and the progress we've made in the past quarter. Our total second quarter revenue of $1.18 billion, $992 million came from advertising. This represents a 32% year-over-year increase overall and a 28% increase for advertising.
Facebook's power to change the way people and businesses influence each other creates unique advertising opportunities. We offer marketers the ability to reach a mass or a targeted audience and establish real and ongoing relationships directly with our customers. Marketers have always known that a recommendation from a friend is one of the most powerful ways to sell their products. Marketing on Facebook is fundamentally different than other mediums because messages can be shared from friend-to-friend. This is word-of-mouth marketing at an unprecedented scale. In an increasingly crowded world, this is essential for the world's largest global companies, as well as the small business around the corner.
We believe we are very well positioned to compete for advertising dollars throughout the entire marketing funnel, from the very top where companies focus on generating demand, to the bottom where the focus is on fulfilling demand. The majority of the advertising spend that is migrated online to date has been for demand fulfillment, which happens when a customer already has intent to purchase. Search advertising has been the primary driver of this migration. Facebook is also effective at the bottom of the funnel, with gaming being a primary example. But we believe that Facebook also helps marketers build brands and generate demand. This is important because the majority of the $600 billion global advertising market is spent on demand generation.
Over the past quarter, we have made important progress in our monetization efforts in 3 areas: first, rolling out new ad products; second, demonstrating their ROI of Facebook ad spend; and third, making it easier for businesses to advertise with us.
I'll start with the new products we introduced. Earlier this year, we launched Sponsored Stories in Facebook News Feed. Sponsored Stories are regular stores that people see in the News Feeds already, updates, likes, comments posted to Facebook every day that a marketer pays to highlight. For example, if I post a positive review of a product I purchased at Walmart, about 20% of my friends have seen the post, depending on things like when they check their News Feed. Using Sponsored Stories, Walmart can pay to boost distribution of this post so a larger percentage of my friends see it.
Delivering social messages in Facebook's News Feed is an extraordinary opportunity for marketers. On the Web, people spend more time using Facebook than any other service by far. We believe this is true in mobile devices as well. Moreover, Facebook users spend a large percentage of their time on News Feed. Sponsored Stories enable marketers to interact with their customers where their customers are spending their time. Our early results are encouraging. As measured by click-through rates, Sponsored Stories in News Feed perform multiple times better on both desktop and mobile than ads in the right-hand column.
Sponsored Stories in News Feed are the cornerstone of our mobile monetization strategy. News Feed functions in exactly the same way whether you're on the desktop or phone. This is important because we avoid the dilemma faced by other industry players, where to put ads on the smaller screens. With News Feed, marketing is incorporated seamlessly into the user experience on mobile devices. We recently enabled our advertisers to buy us exclusively in mobile News Feed. We're seeing strong interest, particularly from our clients, who know mobile is critical to reaching new customers, especially in emerging markets.
As always, at Facebook, the user experience is paramount. We've been delivering and introducing Sponsored Stories in a way that maintains the experience users have with our service. As we continue to roll out Sponsored Stories in News Feed, we are carefully monitoring user engagement and sentiment, and we're pleased with the results today. We believe that Sponsored Stories in News Feed has the potential to be among the most relevant ad formats for marketers. As Mark mentioned, in the short amount of time since launch, by the end of Q2, we are already generating more than $1 million a day from this product with approximately 1/2 of this generated in mobile.
In Q2, we also began testing another new ad product. The Facebook Ad Exchange, or FBX, allows marketers to bid in real-time for ad impressions on Facebook. Real-time bidding is a standard industry practice to help advertisers reach the right customer at the right time, and it will help us deliver more relevant ads to users. We're in an early-offer test with FBX, but advertiser interest is strong. eMarketer estimates this market to be approximately $2 billion in the U.S. alone.
The second area of progress this quarter has come from our efforts to better demonstrate the effectiveness of ad spend on Facebook. Today, nearly every one of the Global Ad Age 100 advertisers spends with us every quarter. But to date, most only allocate a small size of their budget to Facebook, even though their customers spend large amounts of time using our service. This imbalance represents a substantial opportunity for us if we can educate the market about the ROI our ads deliver.
We have partnered with Nielsen to demonstrate that Facebook ads are not just seen but remembered. Studies of over 500 ad campaigns show that on average, Facebook ads drive 98% that are ad recalls and 31% higher brand awareness than non-Facebook online ad campaigns. Independent research has also demonstrated that social context significantly increases both ad recall and brand awareness of Facebook ads. This is not surprising since people are more likely to remember a message that comes from their friend.
We recognize that ad recall is important, but it's only the first step in delivering results for marketers. Marketers' ROI is generated when the cash register rings. We're making great progress measuring our ability to help marketers generate sales. Independent analysis of more than 60 campaigns, 45 of which were completed in the first half of this year, show that 70% of those campaigns delivered a return on ad spend of 3x or better. And 49% of those campaigns delivered a return of 5x or better. I'd like to share a few examples.
Electronic Arts recently spent $2.75 million promoting Battlefield 3 on Facebook. They attributed $12.1 million of their sales to these ads, translating to a 4.4x return on their Facebook marketing spend.
Barclaycard agreed to purchase Facebook ads as part of the direct response strategy to promote NFL team-branded credit cards. They targeted the ads to people based on the specific teams those people like. Their Facebook ads generated a 40% higher conversion rate than any other online ad platforms they used in a campaign. This made their cost per acquisition 48% lower on Facebook than from other online ad buys. In total, 60% of the approved credit card applications from the campaign came from Facebook.
Wooga, an international games developer, used mobile News Feed to drive installs of its Diamond Dash game. They increased downloads by 26% in the U.S., 29% in Germany and 37% in France, all at attractive costs per app installed.
This is just the beginning of our important effort to educate the market about the ROI Facebook ads deliver. We will continue to work account-by-account and campaign-by-campaign to demonstrate the value we provide.
Finally, our third area of progress has been to make it easier for small- and medium-sized businesses to advertise on Facebook. Local business advertising is considered by many to be the Holy Grail of Internet advertising since the market opportunity is so great. This is proving difficult, however, because small business owners often lack the time or ability to adopt new technology. Facebook is uniquely accessible to them. As they typically learn to use Facebook by setting up personal profiles or Timelines, they then discover the value our service can provide them as business owners. Many of the world's approximately 60 million business owners are already Facebook users. Over 11 million businesses already have pages on Facebook. Over 7 million of these pages are actively used each and every month. In addition, hundreds of thousands of small businesses advertise with us. By making it easier to create a business page and run ads, we believe we can increase the number of small and local businesses who use our tools.
In the last quarter, we began testing simpler ads and easier purchase loads. For example, page owners can now turn a post into an ad campaign with just a few clicks. We're still in the early days of building our monetization engine. For the rest of 2012, we plan to focus on the same priorities I have discussed, in particular the ramp-up of Sponsored Stories in News Feed. If we are successful working with advertisers to increase the amount of content they generate that are social and engaging enough to promote on News Feed, we believe we should be able to increase our revenue on those PCs and mobile devices.
In 2012 and beyond, we will also continue to invest in developing new products, particularly in mobile, and in educating the market on the value we deliver. We believe the world is becoming increasingly social and personal, and the future of marketing depends upon building where the map is scaled. We also invest tools for marketers to not just participate in, but to shape this evolution. This will close the gap between the audience we deliver and our share of advertising budget.
Now I'm happy to turn it over to David, to walk you through our financial results for the quarter.
David A. Ebersman
Thank you, Sheryl. And good afternoon, everyone, thanks for joining us on the call today. I'm going to walk you through our Q2 progress against our key financial metrics related to revenue, users and expenses.
As Sheryl mentioned, revenue in the second quarter was up 32% from last year. The strengthening of the dollar cost us a few percentage points of revenue growth, which would've been 36% with constant exchange rates. Ads revenue was up 28%, driven by an 18% increase in the number of ads delivered and a 9% increase in the average price per ad. The increase in ads delivered was primarily due to user growth and also benefited from the net effect of product changes that increased the average number of ads per page relative to last year. Ad impressions continued the recent trend of growing more slowly than users as more of our usage is on mobile devices. This trend is particularly true in markets such as the U.S., where smartphone use is expanding rapidly. The overall number of ads delivered in the U.S. this quarter decreased 2% year-over-year despite a 10% increase in daily users and despite the increase in ads per page from the product changes I mentioned earlier, as daily Web users in the U.S. declined in favor of mobile users. And we're seeing similar trends in other developed markets.
The 9% increase in price per ad was driven primarily by the United States, where CPMs increased by over 20% due in large part to the ramp-up of Sponsored Stories in News Feed on both PCs and mobile devices. Sponsored Stories in News Feed are displayed where the user's primary attention is and are stories that we believe users will find engaging based on their interest and connections. That makes Sponsored Stories in feed more relevant, resulting in stronger click-through rates and higher prices.
Price per ad also increased significantly in Asia and the rest of world markets. These markets are growing more rapidly in terms of users, and therefore, are receiving a growing share of our ad impressions each quarter, so we're pleased to see continued improvement in pricing. The relatively faster volume growth in Asia and rest of world does have the effect of reducing our worldwide average price per ad due to the relatively lower pricing in those markets.
In Europe, price per ad decreased a few percentage points compared to last year, similar to what we saw in Q1, and we believe due in large part to the overall macro environment there. Over the long term, we continue to believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase CPMs. There are a number of potential drivers including: increasing the number of Sponsored Stories delivered in News Feed across desktop and mobile; improvements in our ad products, including better targeting capabilities; increased advertising demand as we continue to demonstrate ROI and as our clients get better at creating social and engaging ads; and overall growth and development of online ad markets globally.
Payments revenue for Q2 was $192 million. For the past 3 sequential quarters, payments revenue has been essentially flat. We believe this trend is due to the fact that gaming, in general, has been growing mainly on mobile devices, where our payment system is generally not utilized. We're continuing to invest in the gaming ecosystem on facebook.com, for example, with our new Facebook App Center, which is designed to help people discover new games and other types of apps as well.
In terms of revenue per user, ARPU increased by double-digit rates in North America, Asia and rest of world and by 8% in Europe, and worldwide ARPU was $1.28 in the quarter. Our higher user growth in geographies with relatively lower revenue works to weigh down worldwide ARPU and the global growth rate.
Staying with user metrics for a minute. We ended June with 955 million monthly users, up 29% from 12 months earlier. On average in June, 552 million people accessed Facebook each day, up 32% from a year ago. Relative to last quarter, Brazil, India and Japan were key contributors to our growth in daily users. 58% of our monthly users were active daily users of the products, which we view as a positive measure of user engagement. And in addition, engagement patterns remain steady or grew across user groups as measured by the percentage of people creating content or providing feedback, such as likes and comments, and by the amount of content and feedback created per person.
We're encouraged that growth in engagement have remained strong as our network has expanded and as we've added later adopters to the service. We view this strong engagement as a sign of the utility of the service in the network and as the foundation for everything we're trying to accomplish.
A couple of points on user metrics. First, we reviewed our methodology for estimating users by geography, and as a result, have made small adjustments to the geographic distribution of users as of the March 31 measurement date. Second, we also refined and improved our methodology for recognizing what we call duplicate or false accounts. These refinements resulted in an increase in our estimate of duplicate or false accounts relative to our earlier global estimate, primarily driven by emerging markets such as Turkey and Indonesia. Please see Slides 18 and 19 for more detail. Since authentic identity is so important to the Facebook experience, we'll continue to try to improve our user measurement techniques with the goal of ensuring that every account on Facebook represents an authentic unique individual.
Turning now to expenses. In Q2, our GAAP expenses were $1.93 billion. As planned and described in our prospectus, the biggest expense item was stock-based compensation, including associated payroll tax, which totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter, driven by the completion of our IPO and the recognition of expense for RSUs granted between 2007 and 2011, which had a vesting condition tied to the IPO. Please take a look at Slide 9 for more information on the past and expected future flow of stock comp expense.
Excluding the effect of stock comp, our remaining expenses increased 60% to $669 million, driven by headcount growth and infrastructure. Headcount at the end of the quarter was just under 4,000, a year-over-year increase of about 50%. While we will seek to remain disciplined in our spend across the company, hiring top talent remains a key priority, enabling us to aggressively pursue the opportunities in mobile, platform and monetization that Mark and Sheryl discussed earlier.
In the second half of 2012, we expect our operating expenses, excluding stock comp, to continue to increase significantly relative to our spend in the second half of last year, probably at a slightly higher growth rate than we observed in Q2. While we ultimately believe Facebook's business model should support attractive operating margins, at this early stage of our growth, investment is a top priority as opposed to managing for a target margin. Therefore, you can expect us to continue an aggressive pace of investment in R&D and infrastructure, in particular.
We had a GAAP operating loss of $743 million in the second quarter. Excluding the effect of stock comp, our operating income would've been $515 million, representing a 43% operating margin. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 79%, driven by the fact that a portion of our stock comp expense is not tax-deductible. Excluding the effect of stock comp, our tax rate would've been approximately 40%. We expect that over the long run, our tax rate will be similar to the rates of other U.S. technology companies that have a similar mix of business inside and outside the U.S. The future reduction in our tax rate will occur gradually over several years.
As described in our prospectus, the amount of cash tax we pay in 2012 and thereafter will be significantly different from the tax provision we report on our P&L, due to the deductions we expect to get from vesting of RSUs and exercise of options. At today's stock price, we estimate we will have a tax deduction of around $13 billion that would reduce our cash taxes for several years.
Our net loss for Q2 was $157 million or $0.08 per share on a GAAP basis. Excluding stock comp, net income in Q2 was $295 million or $0.12 per share compared to $285 million or $0.12 per share in Q2 last year. We purchased $413 million of property and equipment in Q2 and acquired another $52 million of equipment financed through capital leases. As noted in our prospectus for 2012, we expect to invest approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in capital expenditures, including equipment purchased through capital leases. And we ended Q2 with $10.2 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet.
As we look to the second half of 2012, we're encouraged that the network of people using Facebook continues to grow and their engagement is strong. We remain focused on building out better and deeper social experiences for the people who use Facebook, while at the same time executing on the monetization strategies and initiatives outlined today.
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to discuss our progress. We're committed to providing you with balanced and thorough disclosure, and we welcome your feedback today and in the future in terms of how we can make our communications most helpful to you.
On a related note, I want to welcome Deborah Crawford, our new Director of Investor Relations, who you heard from at the beginning of the call. Deborah's been with us for 3 weeks now. And we're thrilled to have her leading our IR efforts.
And now we'd like to open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.
Spencer Wang - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I guess, maybe for Sheryl. I was wondering with respect to the Facebook advertising exchange, based on some of the initial tests, could you just talk about how that may impact monetization as you roll that out? And then the second question is on the Yahoo! patent deal. Just beyond the IP, can you talk about or provide any details on the advertising partnership or the expanded distribution agreement part of it?
Sheryl K. Sandberg
Sure. Facebook Ad Exchange, our real-time being offered, which was advertisers getting real-time on a specific ad impressions. The goal of this is to show people more relevant ads. This is something third parties have been doing across the Web for a while. For us right now, we're at very early alpha stage test and we don't have more information to share. But we're really encouraged by how interested our advertisers and customers are because this gives them an opportunity to connect to users, our users, that they're trying to reach to other things they do across the Web. On the Yahoo! deal, the Yahoo! deal had 2 parts. The first part was a cross license of all the patents. And the second part was a partnership, where we worked with Yahoo! on tent-pole anchor events, such as the Olympics. We were really pleased to sign the Yahoo! deal because it really extended the platform relationship we've had and really brought us back to what was a very good relationship we've had historically with an important client. And I think we'd also like to take the opportunity to congratulate Marissa on her new job at Yahoo!

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Citigroup.
Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
2 questions for Mark. You talked about the engagement. Have you seen any trends in terms of the engagement with the younger cohorts, anything that indicates decline in engagement? And then broadly, how do you think about the size of the company? Facebook relative to other leaders in the technology space runs pretty thin. You've tried to have a pretty lean organization. As you think about the 3 elements of the 3 broad growth areas for the company in the future, do you think you -- is there any change in your thinking about how big the company physically needs to be?
Mark Zuckerberg
Sure. So just to take the first one first. I think what we're seeing is pretty steady growth in engagement in all these cohorts, including the younger ones. So really, nothing out of line with the overall metrics there. On your second question about the overall size of the company, we've always been significantly smaller per employee compared to the number of people who we serve in the world. So it's really baked into the company that we have to build systems and software that take into account the leverage that employees here have. And that's actually one of the reasons why a lot of people love working here and one of the biggest reasons why people cite for wanting to join the company and staying here. So it's also affected the strategy. I mentioned we believe that all these consumer products, and maybe even more than consumer products that people use, will become social over time. But we can't build all those things ourselves, so we focused on building this platform. Over time, it might make sense for us to build more of these things ourselves. But because of the scale that we're at, we really focus on the 3 things that I laid out today. This shift towards mobile is incredibly important. Building the highest quality applications and products is really critical. Building a platform so that the 1 million more developers who use Facebook can build these products. It's the highest leverage thing that we can do. And we think that social ads are just going to monetize much better than nonsocial ads as we increase the percent of our overall advertising that has social context in it. So that's kind of where we are, and we're basically growing by trying to find as many talented engineers as we can for the most part. But I think for the foreseeable future, we're just going to be way smaller than other companies that address significant or comparable size user bases.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard from Wells Fargo.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
One of the questions I'm curious on the mobile front is when you look at monetization, I think there's a lot of different views on how this will play out over the next couple of years. And I'm curious just philosophically, do you think that it is important to own the entire experience, i.e. integrated device, versus being, if you will, purely an application? Or do you think it's, if you will, a federated view of kind of a platform feeding into many applications? How do you think about the different scenarios on that front and how that could potentially work for Facebook?
Mark Zuckerberg
Well, Facebook is the most used app on basically every mobile platform, right? So when we think about what we want to do right now, we want to increase the depth of the experience in addition to just growing users. We thought a lot about this question of -- and I even talked about it in my opening remarks today, we want to not just have apps that people use but also be kind of deeply integrated into the systems as possible. We want to support a  development ecosystem, where other apps can build on top of Facebook. So that's why you'll see us do things like support Apple in the iOS integration that they wanted to do. There are a lot of things that you can build in other operating systems as well that aren't really taking -- that aren't really like building out a whole phone, which I think wouldn't really make much sense for us to do. So I think that there's a big opportunity for us here. The amount of time that people spend in the apps is greater. People come to the apps and use Facebook more when they have mobile phones. And I think we're really much closer to the beginning here than the end in terms of what we can do. If you use the apps today, they're relatively basic compared to what I think anyone can imagine they would want from their Facebook experience on a phone.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
I just wanted to ask 2 things. First, Sheryl, you provided some color on click-through rates on Sponsored Stories relative to the ads on the right-hand rail. I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color on what you're seeing in pricing here on a relative basis early on. And then David, perhaps if you could talk a little bit more about the potential for margin expansion going forward, how you're thinking about that potentially into the back half of the year and '13.
David A. Ebersman
Sure. Doug, this is David. I'll start on the pricing, and then Sheryl can chime in. So we're very pleased by what we've seen in the early ramp-up of Sponsored Stories in feed in both desktop and mobile. But it's important to note that it's early, so we have a relatively limited amount of volume that we've put into the system at this point. I think the test over the second half of the year that we're excited to see happen is working with advertisers to increase demand for Sponsored Stories in feed creating better social content that we can put in feed without having a deleterious effect on the user experience and seeing where that takes us in terms of clicks and prices and things along those nature. So while the early data is quite positive, it is at low volume, so we just have to be careful about extrapolating from it. In terms of margins, not a lot to add to what I said earlier in the call. At this point in time, we are growing the business really focused on the opportunities that we seek to invest in and the importance that they could have and should have for the long-term business that we can build. And so we're more focused on making sure that we're positioned to capitalize on what we're trying to do in mobile and platform and social ads and not trying to optimize for a short-term margin target. In the long run, I think we have the kind of business that because we have such a large network and so much value comes from the content that it's created and distributed by the members of the network to have a business that works really efficiently.
Sheryl K. Sandberg
I'll just add one thing, which is while we're not commenting on pricing specifically because it's early, it's really worth noting that higher click-through rates lead to higher CPMs over time even without pricing changes.

Herman Leung - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Wondering if we can talk about some of the penetration of some of the social ads that you guys have on the platform. Wondering the level of penetration of social ads that you have today on the site and the opportunity -- and I have a quick follow-up.
Sheryl K. Sandberg
So fewer than 1/2 of our ads are social, and it's an increase. We're very focused on increasing the percentage of our ads, which are social in nature. We know from a large number of studies in working with advertisers that the ads that are social have higher engagement rates from users, much higher ROI for advertisers. So driving that percentage up is also, is really important to us. It also feeds into the Sponsored Stories in News Feed strategy that I've spent most of my remarks talking about, which is that we put things in News Feed that are most relevant. So the more social context the ads have and the more relevant they are to our users, the more we'll be able to drive up that percentage of our ads that go into News Feed.
David A. Ebersman
And just to add, just to make sure that we're communicating this clearly, a very small percentage of our ads are Sponsored Stories in News Feed at this point. We just started with that product recently and we're being very careful in terms of the volume that we've put into News Feed because it's such a core part of the user experience.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.
Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I had 2, please. Given the various testing that you always seem to be doing around products and monetization, you've talked a lot today about the success of Sponsored Stories. I was wondering if there are other areas that are looking promising to you based on recent testing. And then secondly, from our calculation, the DAU to MAU ratio declined moderately sequentially both in North America and Europe. I was wondering what you would attribute that to. Is it seasonality? And what are you doing to drive engagement in those regions?
Sheryl K. Sandberg
I can take the first part. Yes, the Sponsored Stories have shown really, really good results. And we are also seeing good results from other ads on the site that have social context. So as we rolled out more ways to make your ads social, we see increasing engagement, increasing ROI from those ads. FBX is early. But our initial testing showed very promising results for advertisers as they are able to connect what they're doing elsewhere across. It's also worth noting how optimistic we are around our early testing around mobile. Mobile for itself is an inherently social experience and for our service is inherently social. And what people are doing on their mobile devices is continuing their News Feed and sharing. So really, the big accomplishment we've had in ads over the last quarter or 2 as we rolled Sponsored Stories into News Feed and on mobile, has been very promising for us because the results show that users engage with those ads and advertisers get a high ROI from them.
David A. Ebersman
First, the DAU relative to MAU comparison. We remain really pleased with the percentage of our monthly users who come back every day. We have sort of assumed earlier on in our history that as we further penetrated the market of people in the world and got into late adopters that, that number would go down. And we've seen that just consistently go up, which I think speaks to the value of kind of the network effects, the more people that use Facebook, the more interesting it is. The number doesn't tend to move dramatically from quarter-to-quarter. It's a slow-moving number. It did decline fractionally from Q1 to Q2 as you noted. I think that 2 things there. One is that we did make some changes to what we've described earlier as background pinging, or I think we called it automatic background activity in the prospectus, which is when phones contact our servers without there being a user active on the other end just to download information. We see that on several of the mobile services, it helps you to have more information from Facebook when you do check your phones. We try and understand what that looks like in terms of technically so that we don't count that as usage, and we sort of continually make some changes. That had some impact on the apples-to-apples nature of the DAU comparison, June versus March. You asked about seasonality. I don't know that we have a great handle on the seasonality effects as it relates to by month. We tend to see things like holidays. There would be some drop in daily level as engagement, so it depends on what month, holidays and other things happen in.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.
Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division
One for Mark and one for David. Mark, wondering if you can give us an update on your acquisition of Instagram. I know it's early but would be curious to hear how the integration of that acquisition is helping your efforts on mobile and monetization, and if there are others out there, other acquisitions like Instagram out there that you see as potentially desirable. Are there other acquisitions like that one? And then David, just wondering on the outlook, most of the models have 2Q as the lowest quarter of the year in terms of your year-over-year growth in revenue. Can you -- I guess, can you validate or confirm that? Is 2Q the lowest quarter of the year in terms of year-over-year growth?
Mark Zuckerberg
Sure. So to the first one, the acquisition hasn't closed, right? So there's been no integration or anything like that. And there will be an update when that happens. In terms of what else we might acquire, I mean, our strategy has primarily been to buy companies for talent. I mean, we have this very entrepreneurial culture, where we want the type of people inside the company to take risks and be the type of people who would want to build out whole companies on their own. So often the best way to find a lot of those people is to find people who are building companies, who maybe are working on a problem where they think that they'd have more leverage if they joined Facebook. So x of Instagram, most of the acquisitions that we've done fit that category, and that will continue to be the approach going forward.
David A. Ebersman
To your second question, I mean, if you sort of start by looking backwards a little bit in terms of how revenue has grown to get us to where we are today, a couple of years ago, we had a couple of hundred million dollars in revenue, and obviously it's grown a lot. It's sort of a combination of, I would say, 2 things: a series of ongoing optimizations that we make every day in trying to make the business work better, increase advertiser demand, better ad formats, et cetera; and then on top of that, major changes that we make, like the introduction of payments, which really started impacting the business late last year, or fundamental changes to the product and how we advertise on it. And so when we look forward to the second half of this year, I think we'll continue to make the kinds of optimizations we're always making to try and drive more advertiser demand, better targeting of ads, et cetera. But the big priority and the big opportunity for us is what we're doing with Sponsored Stories in News Feed. And I think it's just difficult to forecast what that's going to look like because we're still early into it. We started putting Sponsored Stories in feed earlier this year but really didn't ramp that up substantially until really June of this year is when the numbers, we started putting more volume in. And thus far, we feel like we're in a really good position because as we've ramped up to where we are today, we see high levels of advertiser demand and good levels of user engagement. But the forecasting part is difficult because we're going to proceed slowly with this. We want to be sure. The biggest mistake I think we could make is to move too quickly and to find ourselves in a situation where we're having an impact on user engagement that we didn't anticipate or is hard for us to manage. So I think as we continue to ramp up, we will learn from each change we make and see how quickly, or what kind of speed of ramp-up makes the most sense for us. But I think right now, trying to forecast that is difficult.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Great. I just had a follow-up on that, David. In terms of how fast you -- how do you gauge how often to show Sponsored Stories? I mean, what type of feedback are you looking for from people to know that maybe you're showing them too many in News Feed or that you have the ability to maybe put the foot on the gas pedal a little bit more? I also wanted to know if these are rolled out globally at this point to everybody. And then I guess, the last question maybe for Mark would be -- or Sheryl, how do you see local fitting into the mobile experience? And where do you see advertisers in terms of leveraging what Facebook can offer there?
Sheryl K. Sandberg
So for Sponsored Stories, in terms of rolling it out, what we're doing is we're looking at 2 things very carefully. We're looking at the social context to make sure it's really relevant. So the better stories we can generate, where people are interacting with things that are monetizable, the more Sponsored Stories we can roll out. We're also looking really clearly at user reaction. And the good news for us is that it's easy for us to measure user reaction because we can see if users are sharing, clicking, liking, commenting, if they're engaging with those stories. And we can look at how much they're engaging with those stories relative to others. We've also been pretty careful, even when both of those metrics are high, at just limiting the number of Sponsored Stories as we roll out. We've been fairly cautious on only rolling out a certain amount. And we intend to be continually cautious as we really work on user demand, on the user perception. We have not rolled out Sponsored Stories in News Feed across all countries. There are certain countries that we're still working out finishes, so it's not entirely globally rolled out. And with apologies, I'm not sure I remember this -- local, yes, I knew there was a third part of the question. Yes, I mean, local is huge. We've always talked about it. And I think I mentioned it in my remarks. Local is the Holy Grail of the Internet. Everyone is about to get people into local. And this is something, certainly, in my history of working on -- in this industry, I've spent a lot of time on. The problem is that local businesses are just not very tech-savvy. So if you look at local businesses in the United States, obviously one of the more developed markets, something like more than 40% of them have no Web presence at all. So they don't adopt things that are really, in our view, might be something that we would think they would obviously adopt. This is where I think Facebook has a huge competitive advantage because those same local business owners are using Facebook as users. So while they won't adopt something for their product, they've set up their profiles or their timelines, and when they use the product, they start to see messages from other businesses. And then they start thinking, ""Wow, this could work for my business as well."" The product we want them to use, which is pages, is also incredibly similar to their timeline or profile. And so the leap the small business owner needs to make is just smaller here than we think it is with anyone else. And the numbers bear that out. We have so many, as I mentioned before, 7 million small businesses that are using their pages on a monthly basis. Which is something we've done without any really targeted marketing effort to them at all, and then hundreds of thousands of those get up-sold into becoming advertisers. Our push, which I mentioned in my remarks, to make it easier for them to advertise, so the thing we rolled out last quarter, which is you can just pick a poster, do it on your page and make it super easy to advertise. I think those things will make a business a really big difference in accelerating this even further.

Your next question comes from the line of Laura Martin from Needham & Company.
Laura A. Martin - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
A couple for Mark. So Mark, we've been writing a lot about the optionality or the option value of the Facebook platform globally. And I guess, I'm really interested outside the visible revenue streams, which today are payments in advertising. Could you talk through how you're thinking about commerce on this platform? And also video, because video is one of the most shared things, as you know. As we think about over the next 3 to 5 years other revenue streams, how do you think philosophically about what Facebook could become over a longer period of time in terms of revenue streams?
Mark Zuckerberg
Sure. Well, the basic approach that we have for now is we're building out this platform and other companies can build on top of that. And you can view our business as an advertising and payments business or you could view it as there will be these companies that help to transform these industries, and we will get some portion of the value that comes from that, that we're helping to provide, right? So in gaming, for example, we think that we're helping to provide a lot of the value, so we end up getting a relatively high percentage of the revenue that comes into those companies. Whereas in something like music or some of the media companies that are now getting built using Open Graph, I think we aren't providing quite as much of the percentage of the value as with games, so the overall amount of the revenue that comes to Facebook through, whether whatever the breakdown of ads and payments is, I think, will be somewhat less. But a lot of people will do that stuff, too. So I think the real way to think about this is that over time, more and more nuanced experiences will become social. So gaming is such a basic thing that people want to do with their friends, so even with a relatively basic platform, people could build that ecosystem out. Some of the media stuff required more nuance. I think commerce will require a little more and so on. But as these things get built out, I think we'll build out the tools to both enable those products to get built and to be able to capture some percentage of the value that we're helping to create. But I mean, I don't really have any more plans that I'm going to share with you today about our product roadmap or anything like that.
Sheryl K. Sandberg
One thing to think about in the commerce area or in other areas like video is that our view of the world is things become increasingly social. And that takes time. Gaming was obviously first. But people are informed when they purchase things by their friends, and the commerce companies that are really adopting social are seeing good responses. Fab is one of them. Fab is very early on in its history, but it's a truly social shopping experience. And they're seeing near 20% to 40% of their traffic from Facebook on a daily basis, as well as a very good return on their investment on ads that their CEO has been talking about publicly. We look out at what people's shopping behaviors are. And so much of them really -- so much of their shopping behaviors really are social, that we think there's a big opportunity for the social context that we offer to be a major part of how people discover products.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Sena from Evercore Partners.
Kenneth Sena - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division
We hear from marketers a lot that the platform is relatively complicated still in terms of the ad products offered and services. How long -- or how quickly can marketers expect to see that simplified? And then also, in terms of the App Center, can you give us any sense of the economics behind that arrangement? And is there a rev share? And if so, how does that compare to your standard 30% on your platform for payments? And then finally, if you could look back over the last few months in terms of going public, is there anything that you would redo?
Sheryl K. Sandberg
I'll take the first 2 and hand off the third. When you think about the advertising experience on Facebook, it is complicated today. And that's mainly because we're a completely new kind of marketing. We're not TV, we're not search, we are a third medium. And that's presents a challenge because the messages that talk at consumers on other platforms need to really be adopted and changed to be more inclusive. The right ad on TV or on search is the wrong ad for Facebook. Facebook marketers need to learn how to make their ads really a two-way dialogue with consumers. We also have a measurement challenge. When you see an ad on Facebook, you don't go and click to a purchase right there, but you're more likely to search later on and buy a product or to walk into a store and buy a product. So we have the challenge of teaching marketers how to develop social marketing, and then working with them so that we can tie the consumer experience of seeing a Facebook ad and interacting with that brand to a purchase that happens later on. And that's why we're so focused on the market education. With our clients who have done a lot with us, I think they're learning a lot on those trajectories and seeing very positive returns. But it took a long time for the TV market and advertising to be truly understood. It took a long time for search. And I think we're still in that learning curve with a lot of our clients. The good news is that our results are so strong. The ROI results I talked about in my remarks, where we've now done 60 campaigns, if you talk to CMOs, those ROI results of getting to 3x their ad spend or 5x their ad spend or better are truly good, compared very favorably with anything else marketers do. And so our view is that if our ads work and we continue to make our ads work and they work for advertisers and our users, we'll be able to educate the market over time, how quickly that will happen will depend. But we feel like we're on a good part of that growth trajectory. In terms of the App Center, the goal behind the App Center is that we believe social discovery will lead to app installs. You are more likely to want to use an app your friends are using than you are one that you know the generic population represents. Right now, we are not offering paid apps, so the revenue share issue you're talking about is not something we have a product to deal with right now.
David A. Ebersman
And Ken, you asked about lessons learned looking backwards. Obviously, we're disappointed about how the stock has traded, but I think the important thing for us is to stay focused on the fact that we're the same company now as we were before. We've got the same opportunity in front of us to build something really important and valuable over time. And if we stay focused on building great products, we expect and we want to be judged based on the quality of the experiences as we build and the value we can create over the long term.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter from Macquarie.
Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research
I had some phone problems, so I apologize if you got these already. But one question for Mark and one for David. David, when you're thinking about visibility into the back half of the year and how quickly ad revenue is ramping, how does that look versus sort of expectations that were earlier in the quarter pre-IPO? And then a similar question on the OpEx growth. Do you have more visibility, less visibility? How do things look now versus where they were just before the IPO? And then Mark, on the top of the sort of information in the News Feed that the user did not specifically ask for, trending stories or trending video and certainly Sponsored Stories, beyond click-through rate, how do you think about measuring and understanding that user experience so you know not to sort of go over the edge and degrade the user experience?
Mark Zuckerberg
Sure. So I mean, in terms of the methodology for building News Feed -- and at any given point, we have a lot of different tests, different algorithms running, and we measure engagement of everything downstream from News Feed and the whole system, right? So obviously, clicks and engagement and feedback in News Feed, how many people want to share, but also how many page views and how much time people spend on Facebook overall, ad performance, everything, down to all of the different tweaks that we do in News Feed, and user sentiment as well. So I think we have pretty robust systems that are built out around this. And one of the things that I think is pretty interesting is what we've seen is that we can put in good sponsored content and have it not degrade those metrics. So that's really what we're trying to do, is we're rolling some of these Sponsored Stories out more conservatively because we want to make sure that the quality is very high. And we're basically continuing to run those tests to make sure that we are producing the best product that we can.
David A. Ebersman
So Ben, thanks for your question on the looking forward part. I think the 2 things you asked are pretty different, at least from my standpoint. Trying to project operating expenses is, while not easy or precise, we have a fair amount of understanding of how things are trending and what we expect to spend in the second half of the year. So that's why we provided a little bit more specifics in my opening remarks or my prepared remarks about what we expect in terms of operating expense growth. I think revenue growth is just harder to predict, and it's particularly hard to predict when you're really focusing on a new product that you're in the early stages of launching, as we are with Sponsored Stories in News Feed. So as I said, we're pleased with where we are, where we were at the end of June, where we are now. And that's going to make, we hope, a sizable impact on what kinds of performance we can deliver, not just in the second half of the year but over a longer-term horizon because we think this can be, fundamentally, a really important marketing product.

Your last question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
My question was on the Preferred Marketing Developer Program, where I think you're up to around 330 formal partners today, with a great many of them qualified for apps. But around 50 or so, and I think around 20 -- 50 for ads, 20 for insights, and I just wanted to see what your expectations are to see those numbers, both the total number of PMD developers growing and in those 2 categories, in particular.
Sheryl K. Sandberg
I think we're very optimistic about our platform partners. Our goal is to take everything people do, or at least close to everything people do, and make it social. And what we do is provide technology for our platform partners to do that. How many people go into specific programs is not the thing we most focus on. We focus a lot on how many developers out there are using our tools, how many of the apps that are growing quickly, how many of the services people are growing quickly are using tools like Open Graph, as well as ads, so that we can build an ecosystem. Mark said in his remarks that we really believe that we are going to provide the identity and the social layer for everything that happens across Web, across mobile. Given the size of our graph, this engagement people have with us, which even as we grow, is not just staying flat but in many ways increasing. We're very optimistic that if you were choosing to develop a service, you would choose to do it with us. We really consider ourselves a partnership company. And that means that we want to take social companies and make them big, and big companies and make them social, because we think bringing what Facebook provides, which is your friends, makes every service better.
