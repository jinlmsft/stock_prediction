Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great, thank you. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 earnings conference call. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; and CFO, Ned Segal. We hope you've had a chance to read our Shareholder Letter published on our Investor Relations website a little while ago.
This morning we'll begin with just a few brief remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During the Q&A, we'll take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the #TWTR.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call such as our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2018 and our operational plans and strategies.
Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. Also the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our Shareholder Letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. We're going to try something a little bit different instead of reading prepared remarks, I'm just going to spend a few minutes talking about some of the highlights we've had over the quarter.
I wanted to start with our purpose. Our purpose is to serve the public conversation. And we have a singular objective within that purpose, which is around increasing health of the public conversation.
As a reminder, health is a framework for us that allows us to think cohesively around abuse, misinformation, echo chambers and manipulation. And the first thing I wanted to highlight is, we continue to make really steady progress against some of the health initiatives that we're seeing, most notably this quarter around suspicious sign-ups. So we saw a 20% decrease since introducing some new techniques. We see a lot more spammy sign-ups prevalent on the web. And as we detailed in our Shareholder Letter, we've seen a decrease in web daily usage and the double-digit growth on mobile daily usage.
We tend to see a lot more of the, sort of, scripted automation coming through the web versus the API. So this is pretty meaningful in terms of our objective around increasing health.
And as another reminder, we do see health as a growth vector over the long-term. This is an extremely important initiative to us not only for the experience of Twitter, but we believe the long-term growth of a platform and we're really proud of our progress so far. We've seen continued usage increase and growth of daily usage has been really strong 9% year-over-year. We attribute a lot of this to our focus on conversations. One of our initiatives is to make sure that we are focusing on making Twitter a lot more conversational. We believe that conversations is Twitter's superpower and we have made it a lot easier to find the conversations around events that you care about.
So a lot of you have probably noticed, if you're following a particular sports team or a local news event or a global conversation around a particular event, you should see the live event right at the timeline, right at the top of your timeline as its happening. If you tap into that, you see the entire event. If we have a live video stream associated with it you see that. If we have any recap video streams associated with it, you see that. But also you see the conversation. And we've organized the conversation in three ways. One in a recap, so you can quickly catch up to everything that matters in terms of what happened within that event; all the top commentary around the event and these are authoritative voices, folks of credibility around a particular domain area. So for any particular sporting team that might be the beat reporter or the team or someone within the league and their tweets and their conversation.
And then of course, the latest conversation around it and this is a real-time feed of everything that's happening around the event. Events has been a focus for us as we buy us more and more of the service towards interest and topics. And one of our jobs right now is to make sure that we're understanding people's interest as soon as they sign up and matching them with the right events and the right conversations as quickly as we can.
We do believe we have very different dynamics than what you would find on the typical social network. A lot of people come to Twitter because of an interest in something, whether it be a news event, sports, gaming, music or something that they're curious about that is more of a longstanding topic. The faster we can match them to this interest, the better experience they have. And we are focused right now on testing and experimenting a bunch within the events space. And this is certainly proving to show positive results not only in the experience for individuals, but also for our advertisers as well.
Finally, our revenue continues to be very strong. We saw 29% year-over-year increase and that drove better than expected profitability. We're seeing a lot of really strong sentiment in our advertiser base, a lot of positivity because of our focus on topics, on events and on interest.
Twitter has become one of the best places to launch something new, whether it be a product, service or something around your brand. Not only to launch it, but also to see the conversation, have a direct conversation with your customers or potential customers. And we're seeing that in our results as well. So a lot of clarity all focused around that purpose of serving the public conversation and we're seeing that clarity translate into really tangible positive results throughout the business.
So with that, turn it back to Krista for questions.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great, thank you. Chelsea, we're ready to go ahead and poll for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great quarter, guys. Ned, question on the ad revenue. U.S. ad revenue was up pretty massively quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. So, can you provide some additional color on what's driving that strength? Maybe parsing between top 100 and your newer kind of middle-market initiatives? And do you think that you're benefiting from some of the problems that other companies and social media might be having currently? And then what do you think is a sustainable growth trajectory for the U.S. ad business as we look forward? Thank you.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks for the question, Ross. So, a couple things in there. We're really pleased with our performance overall as we outperformed our expectations across most products and geographies. The U.S. was a big driver of that. The business turned faster and more aggressively than we expected this quarter.
There's no change to the strategy which drove that, continuing to deliver great ad formats, to deliver strong relevance, to help advertisers measure the success of their campaigns on Twitter is really driving our success much as it did internationally. When we talked about the top 100 advertisers growing a year ago, that was a sign that the turnaround was beginning and we feel really good about the momentum that we've got going into the seasonally strong fourth quarter for us.
You asked about the mix between large and smaller advertisers. The work that we've done really does benefit all the advertisers on the platform around better ad formats and relevance, but there's still work in front of us to support the millions of small businesses on Twitter who reach their customers on Twitter in many ways, but might not pay us yet for advertising. So we'll have to resource that before we can really realize the potential around it.
You also asked about competition, I'll just spend a minute there. We feel like there's so much that's in our control right now and we feel like our strategy and our execution has done a tremendous amount to lead to the success that we're delivering against today. And so we're just focused on the things that we can do to deliver success right now.
This is a good time to just turn to Jack and talk about advertiser sentiment, because we're seeing such great things from advertisers right now, we should hear from him.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah, so I had the opportunity to visit with a number of our advertisers and agencies in New York during Adweek. And we have this influence council, which meets on a regular basis just to get feedback from our advertisers and agencies on how we're doing, what feedback they have for us, anything critical that we should be paying attention to. And the sentiment is really positive, there's a lot of appreciation for our focus and that certainly on that superpower of conversation, but also the focus on health and increasing health in the public conversation.
We got a lot of high marks around how we're communicating about it, the transparency, the partnership in trying to solve some of these problems together and making sure that we're continuing to work together to be aware of the issues, but also address them not only for our advertisers but for everyone on the service.
And we've seen a lot of resonance with our focus on helping brands launch something new. This is something that we've – I really paid attention to and seen as one of our core jobs for advertisers and we believe we're one of the best places to launch a new product or a new service but more importantly get feedback from the conversation, from the customers. We have some pretty notable examples that I wanted to highlight.
McDonald's in France was a really good one. So they have been testing some various products around offering either French fries or potato wedges and they actually discovered a bunch of feedback on Twitter. So that their customers appreciate having a little bit of mix between French fries and potato wedges whenever they buy some French fries from McDonald's. And they used this insight to create a hashtag and launched a new product on Twitter that had a mix of both French fries and the potato wedges and they sold over one million orders during launch weekend.
Another good example is Lean Cuisine. They launched a campaign in May called ItAll and the campaign touted helping women achieve their all and asked what does having ItAll mean to them. Results showed the power of launching these types of campaigns on Twitter and Twitter delivered the best ROI of any social media platform for the campaign. So we've seen a lot of resonance and appreciation for our focus and also for all of our health initiatives as well.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great, thank you. Next question, please?

Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I realize you're not providing the outlook for 2019 yet, but can you talk at least qualitatively if not quantitatively about how you're thinking about head count growth next year and your ability to use AI versus more people to improve safety and security on the platform? Thanks.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey Doug, thanks for the question. It is too early to talk about 2019, but I'll point out a couple of things for you. One, we don't expect much to change in terms of how we prioritize and resource. Health continues to be our number one priority followed by audience, revenue product and sales. You'll probably hear us talk more about the platform that we use to deliver Twitter because that continued to be a big investment for us and one that we just want to talk more about so people understand how we think about it. But we don't expect any change to those as we get closer to and into next year.
When we think about how we will deliver around health and safety more broadly, we'll continue to leverage technology and the unique characteristics of Twitter, the fact that it's public, open and real-time are differentiating and they help us empower fewer people to do more. There are four elements to our approach that we think about, the first is clear and effective policies; the second is a product strategy that empowers people on Twitter to give us clear signals about what's healthy and what isn't; the third is a Twitter services team, whose focus is to serve the people on the platform including enforcing our policies. And then we think about using machine learning to amplify the efforts of all these to deliver health solutions at scale. It's because of all that our Twitter services team might not be as big as you might hear about from others and all of this is incorporated into our thinking for EBITDA and EBITDA margins for Q4 and our long-term margin targets to which there's no change.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore ISI
Thank you very much. Couple of questions. You've asked us to focus on DAU growth as the best measure of success for Twitter and it's growing, it's growing nicely, but there is also a minor deceleration in the quarter and so just wanted to ask about that. Will that continue into the fourth quarter?
And then as we – as analysts think about user growth just more broadly, maybe just kind of how much does this matter to looking at the success that you saw in the quarter on revenue and monetization. Can revenue growth and this, sort of, performance on revenue and EBITDA continue to outperform or grow well in excess of audience growth for a while, or at some point would we hope and expect that that DAU deceleration returns and reaccelerates? Thanks.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Anthony. I'm going to start and talk about some of the numbers around your question and then I'll turn it to Jack on some of the product work that we're excited about.
First, this is the third quarter in a row where we've grown revenue in excess of audience. As we continue to deliver better ad formats, better relevance against a larger and more engaged audience, we're delivering better for advertisers and we think this is something that we can do for a sustained period of time. At the same time, our purpose is to serve the public conversation and growing daily active usage on the platform is critical to our long-term success. It's the lifeblood of the company. So, we remain focused on growing DAU.
And when we think about opportunity, there are couple things I'll point out. One is that DAU continues to be well less than half of MAU, so there's lots of opportunity to grow DAU both within the base of MAU, and then also to guard from people who are not in the monthly active usage category.
The top of funnel continues to be healthy. We still see 2 million or more people come to the platform everyday who have not been on the service for a month or more, a third of whom have never been on the platform before and we look at that and see lots of opportunity to help them find what they're looking for faster, so that they will stay longer and come back more frequently.
Let me turn to Jack to talk a little bit about some of the work on the product.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Anthony, a few points here. One, we do see health and that initiative and objective as a long-term growth vector for the company. And it will have short-term implications on daily active. But we do ultimately believe and are driving this towards a growth vector, and we believe it's really important to solve this and better the experience more broadly on Twitter.
In terms of the products, we continue to benefit by focusing on relevance. So anything that we do by focusing more relevance on the timeline, on notifications continues to see positive results in usage and a lot of our focus right now is going towards onboarding. We think there's a lot more opportunity around when people first start with Twitter or they return to Twitter.
Typically Twitter has felt fairly mechanical to a lot of folks. So if I am interested in basketball for instance, I have to go and find all the associated accounts with basketball and sometimes they may not even be tweeting about basketball. So, we think we can do a much better job by understanding someone's interest, understanding someone's context that they are coming into the service with and then matching them to the best conversations immediately.
And that might be accounts, that might be conversations, that might be events but ultimately we want to expand the action of follow much more broadly to encapsulate a lot more upfront so that people can get the best of Twitter immediately. And all that's coming through our work on relevance. So we're testing a lot with our events experience to make sure that when people do come in to this events experience, we retain them. And as we continue to prove that out, which we are, we can match that with our onboarding initiatives and then see it as a cohesive end-to-end experience, which becomes a whole lot easier to really match what people come into Twitter for.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore ISI

Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. I had a couple if I can. First, as you look out to 2019, the major event calendar looks a bit light relative to 2018, wondering you have said in the past you are more demand constrained on the advertising side than supply constrained. Does that kind of soften the impact of a lighter event structure and make it less of an issue? Or should we expect kind of an event landscape next year to have any sort of an impact to your kind of revenue outlook?
And then second one I guess, it sounds like you mentioned in the shareholder letter, I think Jack you just mentioned the health efforts are now impacting DAU a little bit on the margin. How much of that is kind of just indirect reallocation of developers and just your product focus versus a more direct impact. You guys kind of called out desktop usage and how should we be thinking about that impact from health going forward on DAU?
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey Lloyd, I'll take the first one, then turn it to Jack on major events. As the platform becomes increasingly global with elections happening all around the world and sporting events happening all around the world, we are increasingly less focused on the things that happen in one country versus another as advertising becomes more always-on and as events stretch out to become more than about a single day on the platform.
So we feel good about the breadth of relationships that we have with advertisers and how they're using the platform and how sometimes the event is a product launch as opposed to something that's happening around the world that you might think of as an event.
You mentioned the comments that we made in the past around being more demand constrained than supply constrained as we look across the platform, as we look across geographies, that continues to be the case. We still see lots of opportunity to impact that balance and to continue to drive relevance to deliver for advertisers and to grow the business.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And Lloyd, and I think the concept we're trying to drive here is agility. And just a little bit more on your question around events. Events are happening every single day. And it's our job to make sure that we're matching the event, whether it be big or small to the right person. Because a lot of these are meaningful to individuals and we need to understand the context that they're coming in and what they're interested in and then matching them, so that they can participate in a meaningful way, whether it be just consuming what's happening with the event or participating in the conversation around it. So we have a lot to choose from. And a lot of our job is finding that and delivering it to someone instantaneously. And that's been a lot of our focus.
In terms of health and technology versus people, we're again trying to build agility here. It would be easy just to run to an answer of hiring as many people as possible to solve the problem, but we want to make sure that we're building really smart technology to further empower all the people that we do have.
And when we do see an opportunity in front of us to accelerate an effort or to solve a problem even faster or much deeper, we're going to take it because, again, we do believe that health ultimately is a growth vector for the service. And we do believe it's important not just for the overall experience, but in terms of making Twitter long-term enduring, as well.
And we're happy with the progress we made, but we have a ton more work to do. So while we do have a team that's dedicated to health initiatives, we have every team around the company thinking about increasing health of the public conversation. It's part of the checklist of our work and making sure that we're not thinking just about superficial fixes and solutions, but we're actually questioning some of the fundamentals and the incentives that the service is providing and making sure that they're also encouraging and increasing healthy conversation on the service, as well. And ultimately all of these changes and initiatives will compound over time into what we believe will be continued strong growth on the service.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Lloyd, I'd just add one thing. If you look at the 9% DAU growth this quarter and you unpack it, as Jack did in his opening remarks, it really does get to the heart of the health work and how we balance that with growing audience. Jack went through how the people who use mobile phones along with other ways they can access the platform, how that continued to grow double digits while we actually saw a year-over-year decline in DAU from those that access Twitter just through a browser, which is often where we see the spammy and suspicious behavior start. That shows a real impact that our health work can have, which is in addition to where sometimes we'll just make resourcing decisions where we'll prioritize health work over things that might grow audience instead.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And next question, please?

Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Your line is open.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi, thanks for taking the question. I got a couple related to the product and advertising. When you simply type in T into the search box on Twitter now, I get Trump and Tribeca, both obviously relevant given what's going on this morning. But when I click on either of these, it opens up to an event page, as you talked about, Jack, but I don't see dedicated advertising. You're not selling kind of a sponsored link or a sponsored piece of that. How do you think about the advertising opportunities tied to search? And is there a big opportunity as you think about search advertising, which obviously is huge for companies like Google.
And then related to kind of new forms of advertising revenue, I know you've talked in prior calls about direct response, but it seems like when – to really light the advertising revenue growth to a whole another level, DR seems like a huge opportunity. Wondering, kind of, where you are in that process. And as you're kind of machine learning it and AI gets better, how does that create opportunities on the direct response side to enter that whole pool of capital that I don't think you're tapping into, but is certainly the largest revenue category at a company like Facebook?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Rich. Yeah, I will say to be frank, we haven't focused as much on search as the potential demands. We've been focusing a lot of our efforts on relevance around the timeline and also notifications and onboarding. We do see a lot of opportunity and potential within search. It's a part of the service that I love.
I think it could be a whole lot better, both from an experience standpoint and certainly from an advertiser perspective as well. So you should expect us to pay a lot more attention to this going forward. We do believe it's a really important part of the service. And we think there's a lot of ways that we can improve that experience, and something that we're really excited to do. But first we want to make sure that we are strengthening where people end up after search. And that's really critical because we want to focus on making sure that we're retaining people when they get to those end points.
And then we're going to start looking at just how they get in there. And search is obviously one major area for current folks on the service. But also on-boarding is a big one for newer returning. So on-boarding is a big focus for us right now. Search will be an ongoing focus for us in the future. But our mindset has been really to focus on where people are spending the majority of their time, making sure it's a great experience, making sure it's easy. And then looking at the ways they come in to strengthen those as well.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Your second question was around VR. We continue to see a big opportunity there as well, Rich. But the interesting trend that we're seeing in the business today is with formats like the video website card and the video app card. At first, and even to a certain extent now, we see people buying them with different objectives. Some people buy them for brand because they want people to watch a video. Others buy them because they want people to click through to an app or to a website.
When we talk to our largest advertising partners, they also see a blending between brand and performance advertising or direct response with formats like this where there are teams that think about one versus the other are beginning to converge in their objectives. And so we hope that formats like this can continue to bring brand and direct response closer together and over time, we will be able to do more to help our advertising partners around direct response.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
So if I just thread that and kind of extrapolate, what you're basically saying, Ned, is that some of the ad dollars that are starting to flow in terms of what we're starting to see in terms of the quarterly performance, you're actually tapping into DR buckets that hadn't been available to Twitter before?
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
The way we think about it is, the buckets may be blending, number one. Number two, we've got more compelling formats which make a broader set of dollars available to us. And we're driving better relevance, which are helping make the case for a strong ROI on Twitter for the whole bucket as opposed to any one piece of it. So, it might be more nuanced than the way you described it, but I might not disagree with the headline.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great, thank you. And the next question, we'll take from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of Jose Kori (30:13). And he asks can you give us some color on the data business?
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks for the question, Jose. We continue to feel really good about our strategy and our execution around the data business. That shows up in the data and other line on the P&L. We continue to see strong growth in data and other. It was up 25% year-over-year to $108 million this quarter. Remember that has data licensing as well as MoPub in it. We've been working hard at our data licensing business to have deeper relationships with fewer customers and we've seen real success there, and we still see lots of opportunity in front of us to continue to work with both our existing partners but also with new businesses.
The great thing about our data business is, we give access to the APIs and it allows our partners to create businesses around them. And we've come out with a premium product over the last couple of quarters which allows people to test and learn around the APIs. To better understand where there might be commercial opportunity for them. So we continue to be excited about the data business.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great, thank you. And next question, please, operator?

Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much. Jack, I was wondering if you could give us a bit of a sense, you talked earlier this year about having come through a period and paying off technical debt to get to where you were now and what that was enabling you to do from a product perspective. As a lot of the, sort of, trust and safety or information quality issues have come up over the year, how much has that taken away from your ability to sort of innovate on the product realizing that information quality is obviously core to the product itself? And where do you think we are in terms of getting the sort of a normalized run rate for that kind of work?
And then, Ned, just, is there a way to quantify the impact that these efforts are having on user growth, I know you guys talked at the end of last quarter about sort of mid single-digit impact. Is there a like-for-like or even just qualitatively a way to think about what MAU or DAU or engagement numbers would look like if we weren't dealing with these information quality or trust and safety issues?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Well, so we don't see these things at odds with each other. We do believe that all of our health initiatives – and again health is a cohesive framework for us that includes a number of things including trust and safety, but also how we think about misinformation and gaming of the platform.
We see our health initiatives as a growth vector ultimately for the company over the long-term. We do realize that they will have short-term implications. But ultimately we believe that not only this is the right thing to do for Twitter but ultimately will lead to growth over the long-term.
So we have had a lot of tech debt around the service, more having to do with our platform that has really slowed down our ability to ship and to innovate and to invent. We're through a lot of that, we still have some work to do, but we are getting a lot more agility in our development and that's definitely having effect on our speed, we're shipping experiments much faster, we're able to learn much faster. Ultimately we want to build an organization, a development organization that can learn really, really fast about what works and what doesn't work. And we're back to a state where we can launch hundreds of experiments and really get a sense of what's working and what's not working and we're getting closer and closer to that.
But ultimately we do see everything that we have to do to innovate an event around the product consistent with our need to make conversation on Twitter healthier. So we see these as parallels, and we don't see them necessarily at tension with one another. We think improving one helps improve the other, but it's forcing us to ask much deeper questions around the service, which ultimately we believe will make the service a whole lot more accessible to more people, and get the people currently on the service in front of a lot more power, so that they can use the service a whole lot more effectively.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Heath, on the second part of your question. I'm going to go into a little bit of detail. But I think the headline if you just boiled it all up would be if you thought about the comments that Jack started with around continuing to get double-digit year-over-year DAU growth from those users that access Twitter across platforms as opposed to web-only usage, which was down year-over-year, that might be the best way to quantify the impact.
But let me go through a couple other things for you. So the MAU decline was both because of three things that we talked about on the call back in July, GDPR, health and SMS, which we expect to continue to be the gyro, the drag going into the fourth quarter. As well as two other things that came up, which were the product changes that reduced automated usage and a bug that impacted a number of notifications that we sent in the quarter that we since addressed. It's those two issues that caused our MAU to decline more than we had expected. So if you're trying to quantify things, hopefully that would help a little bit.
And then you asked about engagement. We continue to be pleased with what we see from an engagement perspective on the platform as we look across geographies and cohorts.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great, thank you. Next question, please?

Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with RW Baird. Your line is open.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Company
Great, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe a question on time spent per user, if that's something you could please talk qualitatively about beyond just the frequency of usage, if you're seeing notable changes in the depth of engagement, for example, with the focus on video and live video, and related to that, in terms of how much growth you're seeing from In-Stream Video Ads and the influence of putting live video at the top of the timeline? Thank you.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Colin, that's not something that we've talked about. When we think about engagement broadly, we look at a bunch of different metrics internally and we continue to feel good about what we see from an engagement perspective. You asked about In-Stream. And In-Stream is a great opportunity for us, but it's really one of many on the advertising side where delivering better ad formats means the Video Website Card, it means the Video App Card, it means In-Stream against great live content. But there's so much other content on the platform at any given time that there's lots of opportunity to continue to grow the advertising against all of that. And new surface areas where we haven't done as much that Jack described, such as search and explore.

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks, a couple questions, please. Have you seen actually greater efforts to influence – greater activity by bad actors on the platform leading up to the upcoming elections? I know you talked about some of the health measures that you've taken. But have you actually seen greater efforts by external actors to manipulate the platform or less?
And then if you could talk about the MAU outlook, and I know you gave some very specific guidance about MAUs for the December quarter, is there a reason to think that when the health efforts, the impact of them on the MAU, when that terminates? Or is it just as possible that MAU growth continues to shed mid single-digit millions throughout 2019? I.e., are health efforts going to be constant effort at the company? Is there a reason to think that you're relatively far down the field in terms of getting the health of the platform where you want it to be? Thank you.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Mark, we think the most important thing for us to do is to be transparent around what we're seeing on the service. And we continue to be transparent with what we've seen in the past and also what we're currently seeing. Certainly with our partnership with governments around the world, particularly the U.S. government around what we're seeing in the past U.S. elections and the upcoming midterm, we just released a number of accounts and information around foreign actors that we saw on the platform in pretty great detail that you can reference. And I think we really said about a week ago.
We haven't seen any more meaningful or greater activity since then, but this is an ongoing concern that we need to constantly address and build into the way we work. And we're really proud of how the team has taken it on and been really agile to make sure that we're addressing the solutions, addressing the problems as they come up with a variety of solutions.
And we're looking, of course, to constantly learn from elections around the world. And what we might do to strengthen the upcoming one certainly in the U.S. but also more globally.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Mark, the second part of your question was around MAU and the potential impact from health. Let me just go through a couple things. First, if you take a step back, we hadn't really talked about MAU prospectively until last quarter. And just given we were able to do math and see a few things in front of us around health, GDPR, decisions we might make around SMS, we highlighted that it would be down and we've done so again for the same three reasons.
It's important when we think about health for us to have the flexibility to do the right things for the platform long-term. Sometimes we will remove accounts from the platform that don't impact our disclosed metrics. You've read a lot about that in Q2, when there were articles about tens of millions of accounts being removed. But the vast majority of those didn't affect user metrics because they were inactive accounts where we caught them at sign-up.
Other times we'll see an opportunity to improve the health of the platform. And it will affect the disclosed metrics, and we just need to have the flexibility to do the right things for the long-term, the platform, whether it affects the metrics or not. And so I wouldn't want to make a prediction around MAU in 2019.
At the same time, we still see lots of opportunity to continue to grow daily usage of Twitter. And when we look at MAU or DAU, rather, continuing to be well less than half of MAU, when we look at the continuing health that we see at the top of the funnel, and we think about the product improvements that we've made over the last couple of years and the opportunity that we see in front of us to continue to improve the service, we still think that those things ought to allow us to continue to grow DAU over time.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC

Operator
Okay. And our last question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks so much. Maybe one just trying to tease out on the pricing. I wanted to understand a little bit of granularity on how much of the pricing improvements you're starting to see in the platform are driven by click-through rate improvements, demand broadly across advertisers on the platform, how we should think about some of those key metrics driving price going forward might delevers not only in Q4 but as we look out to 2019 on the price per ad front? Thanks, guys.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Eric. A couple of things when we think about monetization or pricing. The first is, remember, we're focused on delivering a strong ROI for advertisers. And so the pricing is an output of what happens in the auction. But when they get a good ROI, they invest more in our platform and good things happen for everybody.
On a year-over-year basis, ad engagements were up 50% and CPE was down 14%. Similar to past quarters, we've seen a mix shift of video ads and we continue to drive better ad relevance. Click-through rates are going to be a great way to look at our success around that and they continue to get better.
On a quarter-over-quarter basis, ad engagements, you might have seen this in the metrics sheet, they declined 3%. And CPE was actually up 12%. I'll just remind you these are driven by the auction. I wouldn't read too much into it because so much can vary from one quarter to another such as the product mix shift or events that are happening on the platform such as the World Cup that can drive a lot of ad engagements or the objectives of certain advertiser or a bunch of advertisers around campaigns that they might be running. So those will continue to move around from one period to another. As long as we're delivering a strong ROI for advertisers, we're pleased with the outcome and we'll be able to continue to deliver growth.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Go ahead, I'm sorry.
That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. Our Q3 results reflect our success with advertisers, driving strong revenue growth of 29% year-over-year and better than expected growth across most products and geographies. We're demonstrating Twitter's unique value proposition for advertisers through innovative ad formats, better relevance and continued improvement in ROI.
This quarter's strong results also show we can prioritize the long term health of Twitter while growing the number of people who participate in daily public conversation. We're making meaningful progress on health, doing a better job of detecting and removing spammy and suspicious accounts while continuing to grow DAU 9% in the third quarter.
We look forward to sharing additional updates on our progress next quarter. We'll hold our Q4 call on February 7 before the open. Thank you all for your support and we'll see you on Twitter.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter Second Quarter 2018 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger
Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q2 earnings conference call. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; and CFO, Ned Segal. We hope you've had a chance to read our shareholder letter published on our Investor Relations website this morning. Like last quarter, we'll begin with just a few prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During the Q&A, we'll take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @twitterIR using the #TWTR.
We would also like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call, such as our outlook for Q3 and the full-year of 2018 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. Also, the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our shareholder letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. 
And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey
Good morning from San Francisco and thank you all for joining us. As you saw from our results, we reported a solid quarter; we achieved strong revenue growth; made important progress in our health initiatives and rolled out product update to make it easier to find and follow breaking news and events. These efforts deliver a real tangible improvement to the experience people have.
Before I talk in detail about each of those items, I want to take a step back and provide some context to our results. A few weeks ago, a reporter tweeted, what app has changed your life the most in the past 10 years. Musa Tariq responded Twitter, introduced me to my wife, some of my best friends, my mentors, my best hires and colleagues and through it, I learned from people I only could have dreamt of prior to its existence. That experience like millions of other illustrates unique value of Twitter and shows the important role it plays in everyday life.
Here are three other recent moments we wanted to highlight. People use Twitter to talk about what's happening. There are 72,000 tweets per minute at the end of Game one of the NBA Finals when JR Smith dribbled out the clock and said taking a shot. Twitter provokes conversation when Serena Williams tweeted, she took her first steps, I was training and missed it, I cried, it prompted an outpouring of support and started a dialog about the challenges working mothers face. 
Twitter catalog’s defining moment in history, some of the most memorable moments in the World Cup happened on Twitter, in addition to those on the field with 115 billion impressions during the tournament. We see these types of moments every day that bring us together when we agree and all too often divide us when we don't, but they inspire us to do better and they provide the context for the actions we're taking to prioritize the long term health of Twitter over near term metrics. We believe that Twitter's value as a daily service is enhanced when the conversation on the platform is healthier and people feel safe, freely expressing themselves. 
During the second quarter, we launched new tools to address behaviors that distort and detract from the public conversation and introduced new measures to handle spam, malicious automation and platform manipulation. We also acquired Smyte, a technology company that specializes in safety, spam and security issues to help us address these challenges faster. This is important work that complements what we're doing to connect people with interest and help them discover information. 
We’ve introduced new machine learning algorithms that organize a conversation around events and make it easier for people to find and follow topics, events and interest. We're also making these experiences more accessible by surfacing them on the timeline and explore and in search results as you likely saw during the World Cup. These type of product improvements are contributing to healthy daily active usage growth, which was 11% year-over-year during the second quarter. The momentum on the platform is translating into success with advertisers, with total revenue increasing 24% year-over-year in the second quarter. We're receiving positive feedback from customers about our efforts to enhance advertiser transparency and improve the health of the public conversation.
Earlier this month, Keith Weed, the Chief Marketing Officer of Unilever, the second largest advertiser in the world, publicly praised our efforts. Keith, who is named by Forbes as one of the world's most influential CMOs tweeted, pleased to see Twitter taking a big stand against the fake followers polluting the digital ecosystem, great step forward which strengthens the industry and I hope to see more following. We're making progress and we’ll continue to invest heavily in making Twitter a healthier service, because it's the right thing to do for Twitter as a platform, for the long term health of our business and for society as a whole.
With that, I'll turn it over to Krista for questions.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thanks, Jack. Chelsea, can you please poll for questions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.
Lloyd Walmsley
I have two. Looking, I guess, just at Japan and the strength you're seeing there, can you give us a sense of maybe the extent to which there's unique aspects of the country, either on the user related attribute side or perhaps the ad community side that is driving that success and with a particular eye on maybe thinking through whether it may or may not be a good case study to employ in other geographies and whether you feel like the strong growth there is sustainable?
And then second one, maybe for Jack, you've framed up in the shareholder letter the investment in security product as taking away from product development with a focus on audience growth, but wondering, is there a benefit that you get from improving the safety of the platform in terms of either better retention or audience growth that would seem like, that in and of itself helps improve the product in a meaningful way, but curious just to get your views there.
Ned Segal
It’s Ned. I'll take the first question. On the strength in Japan, I think, there's a few things to point to there. The first is, on the audience side, we definitely learn things from Japan. There are some ways that our -- it is unique, just like any country might have some unique aspects, but as we continue to build a global Twitter, we look to draw from one geography and bring that to another. So when we find great use cases or it needs to help us, broaden the ability to help people find what's happening and what people are talking about on Twitter, we've dealt that for the whole world as opposed to for one geography. Bookmarks are a great example of that, where we saw a need for that that came out of countries like Japan, 280 characters is another where we were able to say more in fewer characters in Japanese than you were able to in other languages. So we extended the character limit for other types of languages. 
There also are some unique things about the ad market in Japan. It's a more concentrated agency market and I think our success recently has to do with both sides of the ledger where we’ve worked hard in audience and engagement and listened, but also where we have executed well on the agency side in this more concentrated market and we're starting to see that bear fruit. We're pleased with our results in Japan, we're pleased more broadly, internationally as well where we grew 44%. International is now over half of revenue and we expect it to continue to grow faster than the US, even though the US actually did accelerate this quarter from about 10% to 15% revenue growth.
Jack Dorsey
And, hey Lloyd, as you point out, we do believe that our health work and focus on improving the health of the public conversation on Twitter is a growth factor over the long term. We want to make sure that we're building this into our DNA. We want to make sure that we are being -- we're able to measure it and held accountable to it as well, but one of the big reasons that we're doing it is when we do focus on removing some of the burden of people reporting or blocking or muting, we do see positive results in our numbers and it's still early. 
We have a lot more work to do, especially in applying machine learning and deep learning and newer models to recognize behavior on the network and shut it down early. We do believe ultimately over time that this will help our growth story and encourage more people to stay with Twitter and also tell friends, family and colleague about all the value they are getting out of it. It helps us with our job of helping to inform people about what's happening in the world and the more we can do that, the more we can encourage people to participate in an active conversation. So over the long term, absolutely, and it's something that we're really focused on.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. Operator, next question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry
Ned. I was wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit more context around the MAU and DAU numbers this quarter. I know, you talked about most of the accounts that were impacted by the information quality initiatives being accounts that were never included those in those numbers, but to the extent that there was an impact, is there any sort of like-for-like comparison that you can just sort of help us with to bridge this quarter.
And then to the extent that these initiatives around information quality and the efforts around surfacing information through machine learning and AI are having an impact beyond just DAU growth and then actually are impacting either the minutes or some other measure of engagement around the amount of time that users are spending on Twitter, any insight that you could share into that would also be helpful?
Ned Segal
Great. Thanks, Heath. So a couple things there. First, if you just look at the quarter and the impact that we saw from some of the work that we did, we mention in the letter that there was about a 3 million negative impact to MAU from the combination of our health works, some decisions to not renew SMS contracts because there's a better way to provide Twitter to those users over time and GDPR. As we look ahead and we just did the math on MAU, it was clear that our health initiatives were going to lead MAU to be down in the mid-single digit millions from what we can tell today. So we thought it was worth sharing that.
When we look, if you just step back from MAU and you look at DAU, we’re really pleased with the performance this past quarter, our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit DAU growth and we look at all three areas that we talked about in the past, organic growth, marketing and the ongoing and continued improvements in the product, as things contributed to year-over-year growth we saw, it was broad based in five of our ten largest markets as well. So definitely, still work to do on both, but pleased with our work to continue to drive usage of Twitter as a daily utility.
You asked if the IQ work or the health work as we like to call it has impacted any of the usage metrics, when we look across the various metrics and we still really good about how things are going on the engagement side. The idea of the work that we do on health, and we definitely see signs of it is that improves the public conversation on Twitter and that's what the work is all about.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Ross Sandler
Just two questions, Ned on the advertising business. So trying to understand the trajectory for the second half of this year. You said, there was 30 million in the second quarter from the World Cup. So should we just net that out and then kind of look at the run rate in the low-20s for owned and operated as the right way to think about back half or any comments on the sequential growth rates for owned and operated?
And then the second question is just on off Twitter ad revenue, it looked like if you strip out TellApart, that was kind of flattish and had grown pretty nicely last quarter, so any color on the trajectory we should expect for off Twitter in back half?
Ned Segal
Thanks, Ross. So first on the ads trajectory, we don't give revenue guidance. We did get EBITDA and EBITDA margin guidance and we recognize back into other parts of the P&L. There's a couple of things that I want to speak to that where asked from our caller. So we mentioned we had 30 million of revenue from the World Cup in the second quarter. Remember, the World Cup spanned both the second and third quarter. We all share more games in more countries in the two weeks of the World Cup that happened in the second quarter. So you should assume that we had more revenue in the first two weeks than we had in the second two weeks, number one. 
Two, when you think about the World Cup more broadly, we're really pleased with the performance that we had, both in giving people a great experience on Twitter, we were able to showcase our events and topics, infrastructure and also in delivering for advertisers. But all that 30 million isn’t incremental. You can imagine some of it would be ads that would be showing on Twitter anyways in an environment where we're increasingly always on for advertisers and some of that would be incremental. As we have more of the conversation around the world cup on Twitter than might be happening elsewhere than might have happened in the past. So I'll leave it to you on the sequential growth and how to think through that, but there's a little color for you to think about around the World Cup.
Your second question was on the Twitter audience platform. So the off network Twitter ads and I think, you backed into that that might have been flat. That’s just kind of bounce around from one period to another and we're always working hard to deliver for advertisers and sometimes, you're going to see more of it show up on the platform at all times, you're going to see it show off, off network.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Doug Anmuth
Just want to ask two. First, just can you talk about how you're thinking about the progress in growing your advertiser base in to the back half and in ’19 and are you more focused in terms of kind of existing big brands, top 100 or are you putting the investment dollars toward self-serve and programmatic more?
And then secondly, can you just talk about the ad revenue de-sell internationally. We saw 1Q to 2Q, anything specific to point out there?
Ned Segal
So first on the progress on the advertiser base, I'll just start by going back to October when the overall business in the third quarter had contracted, but the top 100 advertisers had grown. That was a sign that our strategy with the largest advertisers was really beginning to work that they were seeing, either they could get on Twitter that the ad formats and better relevance where things that are really resonating with them. We have been taking that strategy where we've seen all success and both building on it with those largest advertisers, but also extending it to what we call the torso, which are the next hundreds of advertisers who either don't advertise very much on Twitter or don’t advertise at all and should be advertising a lot because those same things that we're doing for the largest advertisers are things from which they can benefit as well.
You asked about self-serve. That's an area where we know there's a big opportunity in front of us. There are millions of small businesses who are on Twitter and it is such a great use case for all of us who use the platform, but we still haven’t done enough work there on the engineering side to really deliver for those advertisers the way we probably can over time. We talked about Twitter promote mode, which is our subscription service for them. We've seen early signs of success there, but there's definitely more work in front of us and we’ll have to prioritize it, before it will really gain the traction that it deserves. Right now, the work that we’re doing on the ad platform side continues to be the work that benefits all advertisers, more relevance, better ad formats, et cetera.
You asked about international. So, international decelerating off of a high base. We continue to see some real signs of strength there, but in some of the markets that we're growing off of really large numbers, the numbers just end up being a little bit smaller on a percentage basis, but on an absolute basis, are becoming meaningful for us, as international becomes more than half of revenue this past quarter. Our performance ad products at our China export market were really strong. We saw strength in growth in video in Japan, but we also saw strength in other markets that we're excited about, like Middle East and North Africa, Brazil, France and Mexico. So there still is a lot of opportunity in front of us internationally and we think that that will continue to grow faster than the US in the near term as well.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And we'll take the next question from Twitter. It comes from the account of Rich Greenfield and he asks, you cite that DAU to MAU ratio is still well below 50%. Why do you have so many light years? When you look back over the past year, what has been the biggest driver of improvement in that metric and what is your strategy for the coming year to get towards 50%, if not higher?
Ned Segal
Hey, Rich. Thanks for the question. So over the past year, actually the past two years, the biggest impact that we've had in getting people into heavier states of usage has been around relevance. So anytime we add machine learning, deep learning models to the timeline to make the timeline and notifications a lot more relevant to people, where people can show up to the app and they immediately see something that's valuable to them that they want to participate with in conversation, they want to retweet to their followers, they want to like, we see benefit in our numbers. 
We have had to balance over the past few months with our work on health, but generally, the more and more we focus on relevance, the more we see a positive impact in our numbers and we do believe that we have a long, long way to go, a long roadmap ahead in terms of adding more relevance to both the timeline and notifications, but also more broadly, we've been talking for some time about biasing more and more of the services towards interest and topics. We decided to start with events, better organization around events that are happening right now. 
World Cup was our biggest scaled event that we've done. The amazing thing about this is, we have a general infrastructure to deploy this to any event, whether it be the biggest like the World Cup or even small local news, breaking events where we can organize a conversation around what's happening now, all the top experts or people on the ground and a recap of what matters and what's most relevant for people who cannot catch the event live. 
So a lot of our focus over the next few months and years are going to be making sure that we can continue to organize the events experience in a relevant way, but then broadening it to longer term topics. If you're interested in deep learning or big client, you can find a community of conversation around it instantly and continue to participate on it, which we believe will encourage a lot more participation and a lot more heavier states of usage.
Operator
Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.
Colin Sebastian
I have a couple of questions. First, I was hoping you could frame the improvement in user engagements that you're generating from happening now and the other interest base notifications and how much of that might have been specifically related to the World Cup.
And then on the expense side, with the sequential decline in EBITDA and the margin, just trying to segment out how much of the trend is specifically related to the shorter term investments in health and GDPR versus some of the incremental costs of video content and infrastructure and normalized margin trends. Thank you.
Jack Dorsey
I'll share some early data that we're seeing on the World Cup experience and just as a reminder, we didn't do this as a one-off. We built an events infrastructure that we can deploy to small local events and global events like the World Cup. And one of the things that we saw which we’re really excited about is people who access the World Cup experience and saw an organized conversation visited more often, so 39% engaged with two or more games and over 22% engaged with three or more games. 
It's early data, but it gives us some insight into how to better organize a conversation, to encourage more participation, more sharing and how we might roll this out to more and more events all over the world. And again, the goal here and the strategy here is to start with events, but to broaden out to more enduring long-term topics and interests. We do believe that Twitter is more of an interest network than a social network. People come to it to figure out what's going on with a particular topic, with a particular event, a particular interest, find a community of conversation around it and engage in it. 
So that is where the majority of our learning and our work is driving towards. And we're starting with the in-app experience, but that is going to extend throughout the app, including on boarding where we can match people with their interests and events they might care about much, much faster as soon as they get on the service. So we're seeing positive early signs, but a lot more learning and work to do.
Ned Segal
Hey, Colin. Your second question was on EBITDA and margins and where the investment is going. So a few things to point out. The first is, there's no change to our thinking around priorities and areas of investment. We continue to prioritize in order health, audience and engagement, the ad products and sales. We mentioned again this quarter that we expect to grow headcount 10% to 15% this year against those priorities and we – you accumulate the headcount and the expenses that go along with it over the course of the year. So that means that expenses ought to grow on a sequential basis in Q3 relative to Q2, as we continue to invest. We're really pleased with the margin improvement that we have continued to show. And as we think about the margin improvement that you'll see in 2018, it's obviously biased towards the first half of the year, where the significant margin improvement has already played out.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC.
Mark Mahaney
In terms of the health work and removing malicious bad accounts, et cetera, what’s your guesstimate as to how far along the path you are to doing what you need to do? I'm sure it's an ongoing project over the next several years, but do you have a feeling or belief that you just were able to cap a lot of that bad activity, inaccurate activity year to date or is there a reason to think that the size of the work ahead is just in the second half, it’s just as great as it was in the first half.
Jack Dorsey
Thanks, Mark. So we do -- as I said earlier, we do see health as a growth factor for us over the long term. And as you stated, we don't think that this work will necessarily ever be done. It doesn't have an end point and it’s one of those things like security or privacy where you constantly have to evolve and constantly have to stay ten steps ahead, as you learn the dynamics of the network and get better and better. We've made some really meaningful progress and definitely moving faster than our expectations, but there's still a lot ahead. We made a major shift this year in shifting more of our model and our enforcement towards behavior and conduct on the network rather than content. 
That is entirely machine learning and deep learning driven. And that should give us ability to move much, much faster at scale. We're starting to really get a discipline around integrating this into how we think about all of our work. So as we thought about building the events experience and applying it to the World Cup, health was a big factor of this. So it's becoming more and more of our DNA and something that the teams are asking the right questions to start any particular project. 
So as that develops over time, I do believe that we can move at a much more rapid pace. And we're doing a bunch of moves right now that are more course grained to address and acknowledge a bunch of the things that we've seen for quite some time, but we’re unable to fully meet. But then it will be steady state and will continue to push that work as fast as possible, but I am seeing a really good discipline and the pace of innovation continues to rise.
Ned Segal
Hey, Mark. I imagine you're thinking about how to quantify of those comments that Jack shared and there are some things I'd point out to you. As we've talked about in other places and it's in the letter, so you can parse through it in more detail, it's important to think about how our Healthware can impact or not impact at all the disclosed metrics. So you see over the last few weeks about tens of millions accounts that we have removed at various timeframes and remember many of the accounts that we remove, most of them in many situations are inactive. 
That is they haven't been used for 30 days or more, so they are not in the disclosed metrics. Some of them never made it into the disclosed metrics, because we're actually getting better at catching them at sign up and others will be in the disclosed metrics and that's why we shared this morning that 3 million impact from the combination of health and GDPR and SMS and the likelihood for a single digit million decline in the third quarter. So we'll continue to keep you updated on it, but we’ll just always be doing the right thing for the long term health of the platform as the thinking about the impact on the near term metrics.

Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric Sheridan
Maybe following up on the cost dialog from earlier, can you help us understand looking out over the next couple of years, how much of the investments being made in the business, whether it be on the OpEx or the CapEx side or recurring and compounding in nature, because they’re sort of directed towards iteration and safety and security versus one-time in nature or maybe over a shorter period of time over the next one to two years, sort of in a way to give investors a framework of what's being invested to pivot the platform versus sustained OpEx margins over the medium to long term?
And then on engagement, gain maybe more for Jack. Love to understand how you continue to see what you continue to see in video as a stimulant for engagement on the platform and what -- how do you strike the right balance on the curation side and how much of video takes up people's sort of experience on Twitter and where that can go over time?
Ned Segal
Your first question is on margins, where the investments are going and the timeframe. We're focused on making investments for the long term and building a Twitter that can be here forever and that can serve the whole world. And so when we think about those things like health and audience and engagement and the ad products and sales, those are durable investments that we think about for very long time frames, not ones that we think about for short bursts. 
When we think about how to allocate resources and when we might move people from one thing to another, that certainly could happen inside of a period or over quarters or years, but that would affect our margins less so than the long term thinking, but there's no change to our thinking on the long term margin profile of the business. We continue to think that our business can have a similar margin profiles, others like ours in the 40% to 45% range and we demonstrated the ability to do that in the fourth quarter. We just have to balance the ability to demonstrate those margins in any period with the investment opportunities that we see to build a Twitter for the long term that can serve more people than it does today and deliver value for all our stakeholders over time.
Jack Dorsey
And our strength is conversation and video has always been a great conversation piece. So any time, we have video on the platform or within our live experiences, it continues to enrich the conversation. We're building into this quite heavily. We released some time ago the ability for anyone to clip a live video and share it with their followers, their friends to have a conversation around a particular aspect of what they saw during an event, which creates a lot more network effects and dynamics to get more people into the event, to get more people into the video stream. So it's something that we're watching really closely, excited about the growth. 
And in terms of curation over time, we're always looking for opportunities to match conversations already happening on Twitter with really great video content, whether it be live or pre-recorded and we see more and more of those all the time. Now that we do have a generalized event infrastructure that we've tested at scale with the World Cup allows us to move much faster and deploy those videos and match that with a conversation in a much more relevant and faster way. So we're excited about where we are today with video, but there's a lot more ahead of us that we're excited to do to help people get more into the video and get more out of the conversation.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post
Just a couple here. First, we did notice Twitter had an announcement at Google's cloud conference and it looks like you might have some adoption there. Could that be a long term cost savings and how are you thinking about moving some infrastructure to the cloud?
And then secondly, just looking out to Q4, I know the World Cup was helpful, but I appreciate you framing and providing that additional disclosure. Are there any events or comps we should be thinking about, as we do our Q4 models?
Jack Dorsey
Thanks for the questions, Justin. First, on Google cloud, our CTO did present at next -- this week, we have moved some workloads over to GCP. We're always thinking about the best way to deliver Twitter and the best way to deliver a great experience for our engineers who are working hard to make Twitter even better every day and so we’ll continue to balance the work that we do on our own data centers. We saw some significant Cap Ex investments this quarter where we invested $200 million, a lot of it in tech refresh that we did in our own data centers with the opportunities to use Google cloud or other platforms to again deliver Twitter or to deliver great experience to our engineers. So we'll just carefully balance those over time and it’s all incorporated into the margin guidance, the EBITDA guidance and the CapEx guidance that we gave. I wouldn't point you to any change in long-term trends there from what you heard from Parag on stage this week.
Your second question was around events that are coming up in the future. We broke out the World Cup, which happened in Q3, in Q2 and in Q3 and we gave you some granularity around Q2 to help you around what is a pretty large event for us, but if you take a step back and you think about a Global Twitter and all the things that are happening all around the world, there are mid-term elections later in the year, there are elections all over the world that are happening, but at this point, there are events happening all over the world all the time on Twitter and it's our job to make those a great experience for our audience so that they come to Twitter more often and they stay longer when they come and to deliver for advertisers in a way that they want to continue to invest in the platform as opposed to just around those events. So, I don't think there's anything in particular that we point you to.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen.
John Blackledge
Two questions. One on engagement. So the DAU growth has been strong now for almost two years. Just wondering if you can talk about the change in time spent year-over-year for daily users in the second quarter. Any color there? And then the second question would be kind of how do you view the attractiveness of the platform for direct response advertisers relative to peers, any changes or tweets you’re doing there and are you seeing more DR advertisers coming to the platform?
Ned Segal
Thanks, John. I'll take the first and Jack will take the second one. So when we look at engagement, we look at a number of metrics internally. It's hard to boil it up to one for you, but we continue to be pleased with the trends around engagement. Jack gave some great anecdotes around the World Cup and how we saw people continue to come back and use to do events infrastructure that we've laid out, but there is nothing new to report there.
Jack Dorsey
We had another strong quarter for direct response. We’re thinking about this on a slightly different way. We're trying to bring and blend together performance and brands. The best example of this is our video website card, so we can create a product that can be very performant in a really short amount of time, which I think speaks to our increased discipline and ability to understand what the market needs and what our advertisers need and move very fast on an opportunity. The video website card for us has driven a lot better ROI for advertisers across all parts of the funnel. The upper funnel on brands and video impressions and the lower funnel DR uncalled actions. So, we're looking for opportunities to do something new within DR and video website card is a great example of that.
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI.
Anthony DiClemente
A lot of the questions have been covered, but I have a couple of specific follow ups. First on CapEx, Ned, I know that CapEx guidance went up, I think 450 million to 500 million, up from 300 million to 400 million. Can you just talk a little more about what’s specifically driving that? Is it increased infrastructure investment? Is it some of the health initiatives? Is it servers? And then a follow-up also on the World Cup. Thank you, both. Ned, maybe help us with the 30 million revenue benefit, Jack, the machine learning, it’s organized around events, but just, if you could specifically, what was the benefit to audience from the World Cup. Can you quantify that in some way for us in terms of DAU or MAU, just as we look out to expectations for DAU and MAU growth coming out of the World Cup in the 3Q and in the 4Q?
Ned Segal
Thanks Anthony. I’ll take both. First on CapEx. Just to clarify, the guidance range changed from 375 to 450 to 450 to 500, just to make sure we’ve all got this. But when you dig deep on it, I want to point out a couple of things The first is that remember, we've mentioned this for a couple of quarters now, we got some gear in December for which we sent the check in January, consistent with the payment terms, but not consistent with making it easy for you on a year over year compare basis. And so when you move that $45 million from January to December, which I do when I think about what the real trend is in our CapEx, you get to more like 25% to 40% year-over0year growth as opposed to what looks a lot bigger. 
Having said that, we did do a big tech refresh in the second quarter. We spent $200 million give or take on CapEx. It tends to be more efficient to do, more of it at once than it does to spread it out in a way that might look better in analyst financial model, but doesn't work as well in the data center. We continue to invest both in the infrastructure to deliver Twitter in the infrastructure for our engineers and then in the infrastructure to continue to grow headcount 10% to 15% this year. So it just ends up, when you total up, that it’s going to be a little bit more than we had anticipated when we began the year.
Your second question was around the World Cup and events and whether you can see how that's impacting audience and engagement. We look at the World Cup as a great example of something where it's just our job to take advantage of that to give people great experience on Twitter to have them come back in the ways that Jack described and for that to become a durable experience for them, not something that's just about that one event. We’re pleased with the work that we did this quarter, but when we look out across all the different quarters and all the events that are happening all around the world, we don't tend to break out a particular event when we think about its impact on audience and engagement because there are so many of them over the course of the year all around the world.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.
Mark May
The reasons why the health initiatives would impact MAUs are pretty clear to me, but just curious what if any impact there may be near term on revenue? And then just circling back on a earlier question, wondering if you could comment a bit on the durability of the recent strong growth you've seen in Japan?
Jack Dorsey
To the questions, Mark on health, so impacts MAU, impacts DAU less and over time the right thing to do for the platform. We don't really see impacts on revenue from this in fact, impact on revenue ends up being pretty constructive because advertisers embrace the work that we’re doing, they talk about it on the platform, they talk about it when we meet with them and they vote with their dollars and they're continuing to invest more on our platform because the better ROIs that they're getting, because the increased relevance we’re able to deliver to them, and because they recognize that a healthier Twitter as opposed to a disclosed metric is what's going to deliver a great result for them on the platform. So no impacts to revenue, glad you asked the question.
Your second question was around sustainability of growth in Japan. So we've seen some pretty consistent growth in Japan at pretty high levels. We’re thrilled by the performance of our team there and how we’ve been able to deliver both for the people who use the platform and for advertisers there. We don't forecast or guide by country, but we feel really good about what we're doing there and we're working hard to make it continue.
Operator
And our last question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak
Just the first one. Jack, you've done a lot of good work around machine learning and improving the onboarding process with personalization and curation. Just curious if you can share with us any tangible positive results you're seeing around that and what gives you confidence the initiatives are working to drive faster overall user growth?
And the second one is a jump off for either of you guys. As you look into 2019 on the advertising business, how important is growing users among the advertisers to really grow their overall spend on the platform or do you think you can grow meaningfully without growing the user base next year?
Jack Dorsey
So on the machine learning and deep learning, we have gotten a lot better at applying this more and more places around the service. The majority of our focus has actually been on the timeline and notifications and we are seeing some really positive results from that. Our focus on making sure that we're building something that people want to engage with daily is working and where people spend the majority of their time is the timeline and notifications and explore when they exhaust your timeline. We haven't applied as much to onboarding. So that is a huge opportunity for us going forward. 
And as I said earlier, where we're advising more and more of the services is towards interest and topics and events. So the more time we spend on really looking at what's happening in onboarding, making sure that when people come to the service on the web or download the app, they can immediately get into whatever they're interested and get into a conversation, see the experts within and in particular field, topic, interest or event, watch a conversation unfold and ideally participate in it. We think there will be a lot of positive results from that, but to be honest we haven't spent as much time yet on the onboarding flow. 
In particular, we've been focused on people in the service today and looking for opportunities to further engage and make sure that what we're delivering to them is much more relevant. They don't have to do as much work to dig through tweets to find something that matters and something they want to engage with. So on boarding remains a massive opportunity for us and something we are going to focus more and more of our attention on going forward now.
Ned Segal
Brian, I'll take the jump ball. As we look ahead, it's good to step back and look at the last couple of quarters where we grew revenue in excess of audience. If you think back a year or so ago, we've mentioned that revenue would lag audience and it turned out to be the case and as we have continued to work hard on our ad platform on better ad formats and driving better relevance, which has led to ad engagements up 81% this quarter and improving CPMs. We feel really good about the work that we're doing and we do think that there are a number of ways that we continue to lead that, we can continue to grow revenue in excess of ads, I'm sorry, in excess of audience, a lot of that work around the other platform is a good example. 
Our data business is another great example, but as is mobile. Having said that, over time, we -- our mission is to deliver a great experience on Twitter to as many people in the world as we can and we still have lots of work to do there and we recognize that that's going to be the lifeblood of growth for the business over longer periods of time, but still see lots of ways that we can grow revenue in excess of audience in the near term.

This concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Jack Dorsey
Great, thank you. Our results demonstrate the positive impact of our efforts to drive engagement, while delivering for advertisers. We’re continuing to improve the health of the public conversation on Twitter or maintaining profitability, while we invest in the business and we’re making it easier for people to follow events, topics and interests. We look forward to sharing additional updates on our progress next quarter. We’ll hold our Q3 call on October 25 before the market open. Thank you all for your support and we'll see you on Twitter.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter First Quarter 2018 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director-Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 earnings conference call. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; and CFO, Ned Segal. We hope you've had a chance to read our shareholder letter which was published on our Investor Relations website this morning.
Like last quarter, we'll begin with just a few prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During the Q&A, we'll take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @twitterIR using the #TWTR.
We would also like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call such as our outlook for Q2 and the full-year of 2018 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our shareholder letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our progress this quarter, especially in three key areas of our business: our revenue growth accelerated and drove better-than-expected profitability; our audience and engagement continue to grow as we made improvements to our product; and we made meaningful progress in our ongoing safety and information quality work. I'll outline each of these in more detail.
First, we accelerated revenue growth in the first quarter with total revenue up 21% year-over-year and owned and operated ad revenue up 28% year-over-year, driven by continued strong ad engagement growth, improved ROI, and better sales execution. We also drove GAAP profitability for the second consecutive quarter with net income of $61 million and net margin of 9%.
Second, daily active users grew 10% year-over-year making another quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. We continued our work to make it easier for people to follow topics, interest, and events on Twitter with new curated timelines of tweets around breaking news and sports events at the top of the home timeline and launched new product features, including video timestamps and bookmarks, to help people discover and discuss what's happening.
And third, this quarter we committed to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation on Twitter, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress. We're investing in improving the health of our service by building a framework to help encourage more healthy debate, conversations, and critical thinking. And we're soliciting external experts to help us get this right. This is a holistic approach, inclusive of our ongoing work in safety and information quality where we continue to make progress.
We aim to build meaningful, lasting solutions to address the issues affecting our service. It's the right thing to do for the people who use Twitter and critical to growing our business, and it will remain a focus for us throughout 2018.
And now back to Krista for questions.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. Operator, can you please poll for questions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And looks like our first question will come from Anthony DiClemente at Evercore. Anthony, please go ahead.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Great. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I have one for Jack and then one for Ned. Jack, on everything that's gone on in terms of data privacy, I think investors are wondering about the data licensing business that Twitter has. And perhaps how should we think about that business in light of potential privacy regulation? Is it possible that there would be a business impact to that presumably high-margin business that Twitter has?
And then for Ned, my question is about users. You showed double-digit DAU growth in the quarter. But I wanted to ask about MAUs because I noticed, in the Shareholder Letter, you talked about information quality efforts, GDPR and other operational decisions as a headwind to MAUs. And so I just wonder to what extent are some of those factors in the letter near-term headwinds to MAU growth as compared to the longer-term opportunity for broadening out the base of MAUs over a longer period of time. Thank you.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Anthony. I want to start with our principle here. So, we believe that privacy is a fundamental right for everyone we serve on our service. Our data business is something we continue to feel really good about. We are different from our peers in that Twitter is public and we serve the public conversation, so all of our data is out in the public, out in the open. And our data business just organizes that public data in real-time to make it easier for brands, researchers and organizations to utilize it.
I think it's useful just to go over some examples of how people use the data business. To add some color here, we do a lot of sentiment analysis for brands for them to figure out how people feel about their products or services. We see a lot of citizen services being used. A good example of this is Virginia. Their Department of Emergency provides citizen info for the residents. And also research. We see a lot of research. A good example of this is Northeastern who developed a flu tracking technique.
We do not provide any personal, identifiable information that's not already visible on the service. So, we feel really good around the data business, especially with all the conversations going on. And we will continue to hold ourselves publicly accountable to make sure that we fulfill that fundamental right of privacy.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Anthony. Your second question was on MAU and potential impacts. So, a couple things there. First, our focus continues to be to drive usage of Twitter as a daily utility. So, we were thrilled to have our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit DAU growth with the 10% year-over-year growth that we reported.
MAU grew 6 million to 336 million. There were a couple impacts this quarter. We saw some ongoing impact from the changes that were made to the Safari third-party app integration in the fall. That was about a 1 million impact. You can imagine a chunk of that was in the U.S.; the rest was overseas. This is probably the last quarter that we talk about that. It may linger from here but in small enough numbers that we probably won't have to mention it.
The broader health initiatives that is removing spamming and suspicious accounts from Twitter continues to be something that will impact MAU. As we look ahead, to your question, there are a handful of things that we think about. One is the ongoing health and information quality efforts. We're always going to do the right thing to make sure that the service is great for those that should be on it, and that's going to be removing spam and suspicious accounts whenever we can, and we continue to improve at that.
GDPR could have some impact over time. And then we may make decisions over time that affect MAU, and we just want to flag it. Sometimes it could happen in one period or another, so this wasn't meant to be a near or long-term comment so much as it was that there are going to be better ways for us to deliver the benefits of Twitter to people than SMS messages. And frequently, we will come to the decision that we're not going to pay for SMS messages to be delivered in certain markets when the Twitter app that we all use or Twitter Lite can provide a better experience to people. And we just wanted to flag those as things that could be headwinds.
We aren't going to quantify them or talk about the timeframe because it's hard to predict things like that. These are things that should impact MAU more than they do DAU. And we still feel like there's lots of room ahead for us to grow DAU, both within the MAU base and beyond.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Great. Thanks a lot.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler at Barclays. Ross, please go ahead.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thanks, guys. Just two questions. Ned, I guess in the letter, you mentioned on revenue trajectory that the sequential growth is going to look more like 2016 instead of 2017. So just a little color there. I guess it kind of implies an exit run rate in 2018 for owned-and-operated that is a good amount below where you are right now. So, is there something you're seeing in the pipeline, or is that just conservatism in terms of that comment?
And then I guess related to that, a couple quarters ago you guys gave out the growth of top-100 accounts. Given the acceleration that we're seeing right now, any color about where the growth is coming from related to top accounts or smaller accounts would be helpful. Thank you.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thanks, Ross. I'll start on the question around revenue and then we can talk about where the strength is coming from. So it's still early in the quarter. We've got a big global event in the World Cup in front of us and lots of work to do this quarter. We're also facing tougher comps in the second half of this year as we lap the beginning of our strong business recovery that began in Q3 of last year.
As we talked about in February, we continue to believe that our sequential growth rates for total revenue for the remainder of 2018 will resemble those from 2016 more than they will those from last year. We recognize that as you mix and match and try to do math that it may be tempting to back into revenue outcomes from our EBITDA and EBITDA margin guidance, but I'd really suggest that you focus on the sequential revenue growth rate comment when you're modeling revenue.
Your second question was where the growth is coming from. And the strategy for the last couple quarters has been to take all the great things that were really resonating with the top 100 advertisers as an example of the momentum that we're building and the improved advertiser sentiment that we talked about in Q3 and Q4, and to extend that to other advertisers. So we saw broad-based strength this quarter across products, across geographies, and we were thrilled to see the momentum continue in the conversations that we're having with advertisers.
So we'll work hard to continue to deliver a better ROI for both the largest advertisers and what we call the torso accounts, which are those in the middle where we still feel like there's execution opportunity for us as well as the SSA business, which grew nicely this quarter and is where we help smaller businesses and self-serve accounts get advertising on Twitter.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And we'll take the next question from Heath Terry at Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. I was wondering, Ned, maybe if you could disaggregate for us a little bit the divergence that we saw between revenue growth and DAU growth this quarter. I think a lot of us have been sort of anchoring against DAU growth to sort of better understand the potential growth in the business while you were going through the advertising restructuring last year. And so now that we've seen advertising growth accelerate well above DAU growth, wondering if you can give us a sense of how much of that is pricing, how much of it is ad load, how much of it is mix. And particularly if there are any specific products that you see that are really driving that?
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thanks, Heath. So let's talk about that a little bit. We're really focused on two things: the first is drawing audience and engagement. That will always be a key factor in driving revenue growth. And we're pleased with the progress we made this quarter, but there's lots of work in front of us. The second is increasing ROI for advertisers. We are pleased with the progress we made there as well. CPEs were down 28% and ad engagements were up 69%. When you combine those things and you think about the improvements that we're making in video and the ad formats that people are seeing and the relevance that we're driving, you're getting CPMs that continue to be healthy as well.
When we made a comment going back a year or more or so ago that our audience would lead revenue and that proves to be true, and we're now at the point, as you talked about, that revenue is exceeding audience growth. We think that revenue can continue to grow faster than audience and there are a handful of things that we look at: improving ad relevance; showing more compelling video ads; and improving the advertiser experience that is making it easy for them to buy ads on Twitter; better sales execution, getting out there and talking to more advertisers, and articulating to them all the ways that they can get in front of their customers on Twitter.
All this leads to a better ROI, which leads to increased demand. We still feel like we are more demand-constrained than supply-constrained when we look across the platform, across geographies, across different surface areas on the platform, and so there's still lots of work for us to do there. Ad load continues to – there's still opportunity for us there. Ad load was up somewhat due to increased demand, but that really wasn't the driver this quarter.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Heath.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And the next question comes from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question; one for Jack and then one for Ned. Jack, just on the 30-plus new live content partnerships in 1Q; can you talk a little bit about what you're particularly excited about going forward? And perhaps give a little more color on the FIFA World Cup deal in particular? And then, Ned, just on the revenue growth, I think the U.S. grew 2% and international was up 53%, so obviously overall MAU growth is a factor here and perhaps TellApart as well in the comp. But can you just help us understand the key differences geographically? Thanks.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Doug. I'll take the first part. So, one of the things we're really excited about is we continue to strengthen a lot of the product infrastructure that allows us to go beyond just a live stream, but actually show the conversation for any particular event. Something you may have noticed recently is we've been able to put more and more of What's Happening to the Happening Now modules, at the top of people's timelines.
So, any time we get a signal that you're interested in a particular team or an event or a breaking news story, well we can actually put a Happening Now module at the top of your timeline. You can tap into it and if we have a live stream, we will show the live event, whether it be a breaking news event or a sporting event. But more importantly, we can show the conversation around it; everything that people are talking about, experts in the field, top commentators, everything that mattered in a Recap tab. So, we get to show people what's happening in the moment, but also show them what mattered most if they didn't catch the particular event live.
With regards to the 30 live partnerships, we are really excited about the World Cup in particular. We will have every single goal on Twitter where people can discuss it and share it and tweet it. And we're also really excited about some of the other partnerships that we just took on: the MLB, Major League Soccer and People TV. Any time we have a live stream, it enhances the conversation. It enables people to see what's going on wherever they are.
And we also launched a really compelling feature that allows even more conversation, which is Timestamps, so anywhere within the live feed, you can start a tweet and actually show exactly the point in the live feed that you're talking about within your tweet. So, we think this is a great way to highlight where people think something matters and also get a conversation started, but also gives us a lot more signal around what mattered within a particular live event. So really excited about this year and everything that's happening around the World Cup.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Doug. Your second question was on U.S. versus international. It's a good question. I'm glad you asked. So total revenue was up 21%. It's important though, to remember that TellApart business, which we deprecated last year, if you backed that out, we actually were up 27% and O&O was up 28%.
Since TellApart was a U.S. business, if you backed that out from the comps, you actually end up at plus 9% as opposed to the 1% or 2% that you were referring to. 9% definitely isn't 53%. There's still lots of room for us to improve in the United States, but it sounds a lot better than the one, it gives you a better sense for the trajectory of the business right now. We're growing off of a larger base, as you mentioned, in the United States, but it feels like the message to advertisers really is resonating here.
Sentiment is getting better. Our execution is improving, and it's the same things that are driving the business internationally, such as a better ROI from the new ad formats and better relevance being coupled with a larger audience.
I'll give you a couple highlights internationally as well. Video in Japan continues to be an area of strength. Our video and agency partnerships in the UK contributed to the strength this quarter and our performance ads in the China export market where we help Chinese brands outside of China as well as performance ads in Brazil and the Middle East were also areas of strength. So, we think the strength internationally can continue and we're not that far away from international becoming more than half of revenue at Twitter.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you both.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Doug.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian at R. W. Baird.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks and good morning. First off, with video now accounting for more than half of revenues, I'm wondering how much of that format is driven directly or indirectly by live streaming and live events or is that still much more of an opportunity for monetization going forward?
And then just given all the headlines around social media and data privacy, in particular, during March, I wonder if there's any notable change in the linearity of your business worth calling out as you went through the quarter. Thank you.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Colin. So, on video and where the strength is coming from, we definitely saw strength from in-stream videos as a part of the advertising line this quarter. But that definitely was not the only source of strength and there still are much bigger parts of that line, as you can imagine. We saw real strength from the two new ad formats we've talked about the last couple quarters, Video Website Cards and Video App Cards, where we feel like they are driving incremental revenue to Twitter as engaging ways to get people to click through to apps and to websites. So, we feel good about that.
We feel like there's lots more opportunity for us to drive video higher as a percentage of revenue because it's just a more engaging way for advertisers to get in front of their customers on Twitter, whether it's through the ad formats that we have today, through in-stream opportunities or through others that may come up over time.
Let me turn it over to Jack on privacy.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
We haven't seen any change in the linearity of our business. We just released a new privacy policy yesterday to everyone on our service and we continue to make sure that we're pushing ourselves around giving people simple, easy controls around protecting their privacy and seeing the data immediately that we have around them.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thanks. And the next question we'll take is from Twitter. It's from the account of animalethmatologicos (21:44). And here she asks, how is the use of Twitter Lite progressing? And what are the plans that you have there for reaching a greater audience?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. I'm not going to try to repeat the handle, but always good to get a question from Twitter. So, Twitter Lite definitely saw growth this past quarter. We're pleased with the progress there, but it's growing off of a small base. It's definitely an example of what's driving our growth internationally, as we roll out Twitter Lite in more geographies and it gets into more people's hands. In our minds, it's a great example of what we're doing there and one of the reasons why we're able to grow DAU double-digits in five of our ten largest markets.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley at Deutsche Bank.
Kunal Madhukar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Kunal for Lloyd. A couple if I could. One is on this new privacy policy that you just rolled out yesterday. How much of the data are you actually sharing with third-parties? That would be one.
And in terms of the like-for-like products, what are you seeing in terms of pricing and advertiser interest? So, I understand that CPM as a whole is up. But on like-for-like products, how is that trending?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
So, on the first part of the question in terms of data to third parties. Again, our data business is a little bit different from our peers in that we organize the public information so that people can gauge insights from them. Normally, this is used for brands, sentiment analysis for citizen services, governments, local governments in particular and researchers. And we have a Know Your Customer policy, so that we do extensive research in terms of who is our customer around the data. But, again, a lot of the data is in the public and we do not sell any personal identifiable information.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Your second question was on pricing on a like-for-like basis. So just as a headline, CPE was down 28%. It was more about mix shift to video than it was like-for-like, but there was some like-for-like compression as well on a CPE basis. We continue to feel really good about the CPE as it is indicative of the improved ROI that we're delivering to advertisers when you couple it with the click-through rates, which continue to get better based on better formats such as video and better relevance against a bigger audience.
Kunal Madhukar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on user growth. I know in the past you've talked about how many daily visitors you have to the platform and efforts to improve ultimate conversion and user growth. I guess could you talk about a couple of successes or tangible examples you've had in ways to bring more of these daily visitors into the ecosystem to make them stick? And what do you think is the biggest point of friction you still need to solve?
And then the second one on the advertising side, you made some really good progress on the ad business. As you think about biggest areas of improvement or the constraint to getting a bigger share of ad budgets, what are your one or two big focal points to improve the ad product as we go throughout 2018?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Brian. So, as we continue to add relevance to where people spend a majority of their time, namely the timeline and notifications, we continue to see really positive results. So being able to show a relevant timeline immediately is definitely the stickiest aspect of Twitter. We have been looking a lot at onboarding and what we can do there.
In particular, we are not a social network and we do not benefit from the same social graph that social networks do. People come to us because they're interested in something and they're interested in seeing what's happening within the world or within a particular topic or within a particular niche interest. And the faster we can get them to connect with that, the better, the more value they get out of our service.
So, we've been biasing a lot more of the service towards interest and towards topics. Been doing a lot of experiments within the Explore tab to make sure that we are building the right experience before we build it into the timeline, or right into onboarding, but you'll see a lot more of this sort of work, where we try to get people to their interest much faster, so they can follow them right in the timeline and right through notifications. And we have a number of product experiences that are live today that we continue to iterate and refine and test, and some new ones that we're excited to push out quite soon against this.
The most notable of which that has matured quite a lot is the Happening Now module, which, again, you tap into if we have a live video, we show it right at the top and that could be a sporting event or it could be breaking news. We may have multiple videos for a particular event – multiple live videos for a particular event. And then, we also show the entire conversation around it based around relevance, all machine learning, and deep-learning driven and also a recap of what mattered most within that event if you were unable to catch it live or came in in the middle of the event. So, the more we do around interests, the more friction we remove for people to get there, the higher the benefit.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then on the advertising side?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Sorry. Almost forgot your second question. So, in terms of our priorities for the ad side, the more we continue to improve our core offering through better performance and measurement, the stronger we get. This comes in multiple ways.
One, we're focused on making sure that we are just improving the core ad platform. We continue to look for opportunities to differentiate our ad products and really match it with the public conversation that we serve. We're focused a lot on measurement and we're focused on third-party accreditation and we continue to benefit from tapping into new channels of demand specifically online video and new ways to buy ads on Twitter as well.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May at Citi.
Mark A. May - Citi
Thank you. You noted that video ads are now greater than 50% of the total and I was hoping that you could speak to the impact on the monetization improvements from the increased mix of video ads and how that impacts yields and how much more room that you think you have there? And then secondly, what was it about Japan that resulted in such strong growth in the quarter? Thanks.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Mark. I covered some of this earlier, but let me go back to it. On the monetization side, so video is now more than half of ad revenue, it's the second quarter where that's been the case, but we still feel like there's lots of opportunity from here both through the formats that we have today, through better relevance, through new formats, through increasing audience, and better sales execution. All of those are ways where we think we can continue to drive more penetration of video, whether it's against the timeline or live video or the events and topics, broader strategy that Jack described. So we still feel like there's lots of opportunity there and as you mentioned, video, given the pricing dynamics, it can pull CPEs down. When you couple that with the positive impact that it has on ad engagements and on clickthrough rates, you end up delivering a better ROI to advertisers and CPMs continue to be stable and pretty healthy with that as a backdrop.
If you look at Japan, we continue to see strength there that we're really pleased with. It's our second largest market and our sales execution coupled with the audience growth that we've seen have been really strong business drivers. It's been a performance and a video-driven ad market and we've been really pleased with the progress we've made there. We've also made really good progress with the agencies there and that's led to better execution on the sales side.
Mark A. May - Citi
Thanks.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Greenfield at BTIG.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If we look at your DAUs, the two-year stack I think is up somewhere around 24% and you've continued to accelerate quarter after quarter. Wondering as you look at that as a proxy for engagement, could you give us any sense of what overall time spent is doing on the platform on a per-user basis? Is there any kind of color you could provide?
And then two, I think one of you talked last quarter about early signs of progress on the direct response side of advertising which I know had been kind of a real trouble spot for Twitter 12 to 18 months ago. Wondering if you could give us an update on what you're seeing in DR and how big of an opportunity that whole market is for you as you go forward throughout 2018? Thanks.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Rich. I'll take the first part on time spent. Nothing new to report there. We continue to be pleased with the engagement that we're seeing on the platform as we grow the base of folks who use Twitter on a daily basis. Let me turn it over to Jack on direct response.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah, direct response had another strong quarter and just to take a step back, we see performance and brand blending together, so a good example of this which we spoke about last quarter is the Video Website Card, so this combines the power of video to drive both awareness and interest with the ability to drive our advertiser objective. So we're looking at how these two things come together to fulfill the overall performance needs on the platform and it's doing well.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
And maybe just to follow up on the time spent point. As you think about your pitch to advertisers, as you move out over the next couple of weeks in New York, what is the main message of why someone should be shifting more dollars to Twitter versus other platforms?
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Rich, it's about a few things. It's the growing engaged audience; six quarters in a row of double-digit DAU growth really resonates with advertisers. It's the lower prices that they're getting on Twitter as we see mix shift to video and CPEs come down. It's better performing products, as indicated by the clickthrough rates and ad engagement rates that we talked about. It's improved measurement, as Jack described.
And then the differentiated opportunity we offer to get them in front of their customers on Twitter, whether we're the second screen and we are increasing brand awareness while they're watching something somewhere else, or we're the place where they're deeply engaged at the moment around an event or topic or just going through their timeline, and it feels like that's something that's really resonating.
You mentioned the next few weeks we have the NewFronts coming up and we're really excited about the opportunity to talk to advertisers about the content that they'll be able to advertise against on Twitter in the coming year.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. Just want to follow up on the video transition. As that levels off, how do you expect that to impact revenues at that point? And do you still have a lot of pricing to go as you look at your video business?
And then second, on GDPR, it looks like you're helping us with the second quarter revenues with your numbers without giving formal guidance, but have you factored anything in your revenue outlook for the back half of the quarter post-GDPR? And how are you thinking about that for the second half? Thank you.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Justin. First on video. So, we still think there's a lot of room. You mentioned leveling off. We feel like there's a lot of room in front of us to increase video as a way that advertisers get in front of their customers on Twitter and, therefore, increase it as a percentage of our ad dollars. That's through new ad formats, the existing ad formats against a bigger audience and improving relevance over time, so those ought to continue to drive revenue from here.
From a pricing perspective, to the extent video continues to have lower CPEs than other ad formats, we'll have to show more videos in order to offset that, but that's been the trend now for some time, as indicated by that minus 28% in CPE and the plus 69% in ad engagements. So, we're really pleased with the direction of video as a percentage of ad revenue and we'll continue to drive it higher in our work with advertisers.
Secondly, you asked about GDPR and our thoughts around revenue. So, we've incorporated our thinking around GDPR and everything else into the EBITDA and EBITDA margin guidance that we've given for the second quarter. But if you take a step back, it is too early to predict the impact that regulation is going to have on the business.
Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Great. Maybe I could follow up. Do you still think there's a lot of room to increase like-for-like pricing around video from here? Thanks.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
So, Justin, when we think about pricing and we see like-for-like come down, it is an opportunity to deliver a better ROI to advertisers. But we can couple that with better ad formats and better relevance. We are thrilled to talk to advertisers about pricing coming down as it has and as it may on Twitter, so we don't really think about in the context of an auction format driving pricing higher so much as we do delivering a great ROI to advertisers.
Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And next question comes from Mark Mahaney at RBC.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Mark.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning. Two questions, please. First, that MAU growth sequentially was pretty solid. Do you want to call out any particular markets or countries that drove that MAU growth internationally sequentially? And then secondly, could you talk about how much you're needing to spend or investing in platform security, just given overall data privacy concerns and concerns over the abuse or misuse of platforms by third-party, by bad actors out there? How much has that caused you to increase spend on platform security this year or for the next couple of years? Thank you.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Mark. So, you asked about MAU. We were pleased with the breadth of audience and engagement improvement that we saw this quarter. I mentioned earlier five of our 10 largest markets grew DAU double-digits this past quarter. And that is probably the best way to indicate the breadth that we saw across markets around audience broadly defined.
When we think about platform security, that will continue to be an area of investment for us. We think about four areas where we will grow head count aggressively this year. Improving health of the platform would be one. Driving audience and engagement would be another. Improving revenue products is the third. And then ongoing investments in sales.
If you take a step back and think about what we'll do around head count, we mentioned in the letter that we expect to grow head count 10% to 15% in 2018. As you can imagine, you don't hire all those people all at once; you hire them gradually over the course of the year. And so, we don't expect to have the full burden of all of them for the full year, but we will leave the year with a head count and a team that's 10% to 15% larger than the one that we started the year with. And that hopefully is indicative to you of both where the priorities are from a hiring perspective and how we're thinking about the opportunities in front of us.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thanks, Ned.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And the next question comes from Eric Sheridan at UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two. Going back to the pricing, you've called out that shift in pricing to lower CPE formats but is the gap closing? I know you talked a little bit about trying to earn ROIs for advertisers but any sense you can give us about the gap between video and other formats on CPE and how that might close over the medium to long-term?
Second question would be for Jack. With Facebook saying early in the quarter in January that they would be emphasizing more family and friend content and possibly de-emphasizing content from publishers and new sources, was that something you can capitalize on either on the engagement side or partnering with publishers or working on product to sort of develop more referrals? Your comment on that would be appreciated. Thanks, guys.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Eric. On the first part of your question around the gap closing, I think that just the framing of the question is different than how we think about it from a strategy perspective.
If CPEs are coming down and it's because people are embracing a different ad format which is more engaging with a larger audience, we're thrilled about that, and we're just not going to focus on pricing of an engagement when we think about the opportunity as we think about delivering a better ROI for our advertisers. And so, you really have to think about the other layers of what drive that in order to consider the opportunity. Let me turn over to Jack on the second part of your question.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah. So, Eric, over the past two years, we've really focused on, number one, identifying our core job and then, number two, building against it and that core job is keeping people informed. So the more we lean into that and the more we make sure that we're building products against that and services against that, the better we do. We have always benefited as a service from having journalists on our service, and one of our most important constituents are journalists. They certainly release all their publications and articles, but also carry through the conversation use Twitter as a source.
People naturally see Twitter as a place to figure out what's going on and what's happening within the world. Again, with global news, with local news, with anything newsworthy around a particular topic or an interest. And we do believe it is our core job to keep people informed against that.
So, as we continue to add relevance to the product through our machine learning and deep learning work, as we continue to experiment with biasing more towards interest and topics, particularly around anything new and noteworthy that's going on in the world, we benefit as well. And as we put live video against that as well to make the conversation much stronger and more relevant, we benefit. So, yes, we definitely as we continue to focus on that core job, we see a lot of the benefits that we've been able to report over the past few years.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks a lot.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you and it looks like we have time for just one last question, so we'll take that question from John Blackledge at Cowen.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. Two questions. So with video advertising about half of ad revenue at this point, just wondering if you could provide some color on video engagement on the platform. And then second question would be if you can offer or give us an update on the total number of advertisers on the platform and/or the advertiser growth in 1Q 2018? Thank you.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, John. So on video engagement, we continue to be pleased with the progress that we're making there both on the live content that Jack described, on the user-generated video content and on engagement with video ads on the platform. We see strong trajectory in all three of those and they continue to be areas of investment for us. In terms of total number of advertisers, nothing new to report there but I'll just remind you of a couple of things around our strategy and the opportunity.
The first is that we started out a year ago really working hard with the largest advertisers to tell them the story about Twitter, to help them think about the ways that they could connect with their customers on the platform, and that really resonated when we got to the second half of the year. We've been gradually bringing that to other accounts as well and that's been working really well for us. We also feel like there's an opportunity over time with the millions of small businesses on Twitter.
We saw nice growth from our self-serve business this past quarter, but we feel like there's more opportunity there. It will require more investment from us against newer products in order to help them. One that we've talked about in the past is the Twitter Promote Mode product which is the subscription product and we see nice growth off of a very small base but we think that's indicative of the opportunity and we've got more work to do there in order to get those millions of small businesses to become advertisers on the platform.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings conference call. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey and CFO, Ned Segal. We hope you've had a chance to read our Shareholder Letter published on our Investor Relations website this morning. Like last quarter, we'll begin with just a few prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions.
During the Q&A, we'll take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the #TWTR.
We would also like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call such as our outlook for Q1 and the full year of 2018 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially.
These forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our Shareholder Letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. First, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge Anthony Noto and all of his impact to Twitter. He's been an incredible advocate for us and a trusted partner to me and our leadership team. Thank you, Anthony. We wish you all the best in your new role.
Now let's talk about our results. Q4 was a strong finish to the year with a return to revenue growth, GAAP profitability, and an increased shipping cadence. I'll outline each of these in more detail.
First, we're really proud to report a return to revenue growth in Q4 with total revenue increasing 2% year-over-year, and owned-and-operated advertising revenue increasing 7% year-over-year, reflecting better-than-expected performance across all of our major products and geographies. This was driven by continued strong engagement growth, improvements in our revenue products, improved ROI, and better sales execution.
Second, we delivered on our goal of GAAP profitability in Q4 and achieved record GAAP net margins and target adjusted EBITDA margins, reflecting our continued prioritization and disciplined execution across all of our priorities.
And third, our audience and engagement continue to grow. We increased our shipping cadence and launched new features to help people discover and talk about what's happening on Twitter, including making it easier to thread multiple tweets together and expanding our character limit from 140 to 280 characters, so people can say a little bit more. As a result, we saw our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit DAU growth.
We're investing to make 2018 a year of growth and expect our expenses to more closely align with revenue after a year of significant margin improvement. We're proud of the steady progress we made in 2017, and we're confident in our path ahead. We've got significant opportunity ahead of us to put Twitter in as many people's hands as possible and to make the service more relevant to more people every single day.
And now back to Krista for questions.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And, operator, would you like to poll for questions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And it looks like our first question comes from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan. Doug, please go ahead.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I have two. First, can you just talk about the key factors improving your ad relevance in the quarter, in particular, some of the stuff around ad serving logic and just what improved clickthrough rate? And then just second on DAU growth, your fifth straight quarter of consecutive double-digit DAU growth. How do you think about the potential to grow DAUs going forward even as MAU growth has been more muted? If you could talk about that. Thanks.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah. So, in terms of improved ROI and what's going on with our ad relevance drivers and the drivers in general, we're benefiting from a much larger engaged audience, so we've seen eight quarters of solid year-over-year growth and DAU over the last five quarters posting double-digit growth. We have a lower price, so CPE is down more 40% year-over-year in aggregate.
Our products are performing better with a higher CTR. We continue to be a differentiated offering to our advertisers, so we're delivering an influential audience and real-time relevance for audience. And we've also been investing a lot in measurement as well, so we're scaling our measurement capabilities to 62% more custom studies in Q4 2017 versus a year ago.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
And, Doug, to your question on DAU, we don't give guidance for audience and engagement growth, but we do feel like the product improvements that we've made over the last couple of years ought to continue to compound and should be a driver of audience and engagement growth going forward.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you both.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heath Terry at Goldman Sachs. Heath, please go ahead.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you. To follow up a bit on the question of MAU growth, to the extent that we saw relatively stable MAUs this quarter, we know that you've undertaken some efforts to improve the quality of the MAUs on the platform or the quality of the users on the platform eliminating bots and enforcing some of the safety policies more aggressively. Should we look at this 330 million this quarter compared to say 330 million last quarter and consider it a higher quality number? And then to the extent that we are thinking about user growth into 2018, are initiatives around those same sort of trust and safety things likely to impact that reported number?
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
So, why doesn't Jack start on IQ and then I'll go into the numbers a little bit for you.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
So, just to give you an update on how we're thinking about information quality, this is a new term we used in our letter and I wanted to define it for you. We're looking at information quality as a cohesive way of addressing all malicious activity on the service and that's inclusive of spam, malicious automations and also fake accounts.
And we have three main priorities in this approach. One is we're going to improve how we detect and remediate automated content and malicious manipulation. We're going to amplify the quality content across all of our products and we're going to start by focusing on search and trends. And then we're also going to be giving a lot more context to help people identify more authentic and credible accounts and tweets. So, we are working on the overall quality of the content and tweets on the service but also the accounts.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
And just to give you a little more sense around the numbers, we mentioned in the letter that MAU grew 4% year-over-year. It was the third consecutive quarter where it grew 4% driven by our ongoing product improvements, but we continue to be focused on growing usage of Twitter as a daily utility.
When we think about MAU, though, there were those two negative impacts that we talked about in October. One was the change to Safari's third-party app integration. That was a negative 2 million impact, a million of which was in the U.S. and a million was international, and then we saw the typical seasonality which can be negative in the fourth quarter.
We also saw meaningful headwinds from the information quality efforts that Jack talked about, as we continue to focus on improving the quality of the information and users on Twitter. It's hard to predict how those information quality efforts could impact user accounts over time. Some of the efforts that we undertake are to remove dormant accounts. Others are to remove accounts on the day of sign-up, so they don't even end up in a customer account, and then others do affect MAU or DAU and we're always going to do the right thing for the service.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks, Jack. Thanks, Ned.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian at R. W. Baird. Colin, please go ahead.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thank you. A couple for me. I was hoping you could add some color to the pace of adoption of the Video Website Cards, seems like this was a fairly significant incremental contributor in Q4. And how much of that's on the pricing side or unlocking demand from a larger advertising audience, for example?
And then as a follow-up to the comment on expenses, should we conclude from that that there are fewer opportunities at this point to rationalize costs following a couple of years of focus on that, or are there specific areas where you're anticipating adding to head count or expenses? I'll leave it at that. Thanks.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thanks, Colin. So, on the Video Website Card, it's a great example of an investment in improving the ad formats, which has really begun to pay off. We did see incremental dollars flow to Twitter as a result of the Video Website Card and the Video App Card, two newer ad formats, which were a positive driver in the fourth quarter. And we just like to think of those as examples of ways that we've been able to improve the dialogue and improve the investment in Twitter by advertisers.
If you look at expense growth, there may be opportunities to rationalize costs, but we're really focused on investing to grow in 2018. We'll invest in the product both in our information quality efforts and in driving audience and engagement, and we'll also invest in sales to make sure that we've got the right folks on the ground talking to advertisers about all the great things happening on Twitter right now. So, it's those investments that ought to cause expenses to more closely align with revenue and would be the reasons that margins ought to look a lot more like 2017, then expanding from here after a year of significant margin improvement.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay, thanks.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente at Evercore. Please go ahead, Anthony.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of follow-ups on the results in the fourth quarter for me. Can you just talk a little bit more, Ned, about any particular benefit, if you can quantify it that would be great, from ad market seasonality or seasonal strength that you saw in the fourth quarter as it relates to branded advertising or holiday season which we can tell across the retail vertical was quite strong?
And then also maybe similarly, just anything that you can give us on the performance of brand versus direct response or the split between those channels. I think you said brand was the largest contributor and the sustainability if we think about revenue in terms of brand versus DR going forward. So, thanks for the questions.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Anthony. So, a couple things there. We saw strength throughout the quarter and advertising business definitely sees seasonal strength in the fourth quarter, but it feels like a lot of the things that we saw in the fourth quarter are results of the audience and engagement growth and the ongoing improved execution and better ROI that we're able to deliver to advertisers.
The tentpole events, whether it's Black Friday or a big sporting event, are still positive drivers at Twitter, but we're seeing their impact extend over longer periods of time and we're turning into an always-on ad buy for advertisers, which has been great for us. I'm trying to remember if there was another part to your question.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Direct response versus branded advertising, and how that mix might be changing.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah, Jack, do you want to talk a little bit about that?
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Yeah. So, we're actually doing really well with our DR products. Ned mentioned the health of the Video Website Cards and also the Video App Cards, so DR outperformed all of our expectations in Q4 and it's benefiting from the platform improvements and also the introduction of a new DR product, which is the Video App Card. So, this has added up to being a pretty strong – a strong product for us and we're excited to continue to improving it.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Brand continues to be the biggest driver, but we're really pleased with how DR has played out for us right now.
Anthony DiClemente - Evercore Group LLC
Okay, thanks.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great, thank you. And the next question comes from Twitter, comes from the Twitter account of (13:50), and he or she asks will there ever actually be figures for DAU.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
So, thanks for the question from Twitter. We have disclosure principles that we use to carefully weigh what we share and they are to make sure that we're giving investors the best information we can to help them make good decisions about our stock, while weighing things that impact our ability to run the business and make good decisions internally, and we have a high bar for making changes and an even higher bar for making changes inside of a year to make sure that you all are able to compare things from one period to another.
As we balance those, we feel like continuing to share the absolute number of MAU as we've done for some time, gives you a sense for a number that's higher up in the funnel, and giving you the percentage growth for DAU gives you a sense for our trajectory in driving usage of Twitter as a daily utility. We give percentages for other things too like cost per engagement and ad engagements to give you a sense for the trajectory there, and so we'll continue to do that.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley at Deutsche Bank. Lloyd, please go ahead.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, guys. Congrats on the solid results. This is actually Matt Diamond on Lloyd's behalf. I wanted to ask the DAU question a little bit differently. Ned, it was mentioned in 4Q that there were roughly 2 million people a day coming back to the platform. I'm wondering does that trend still obtain. And anything we should keep in minds as we get into 2018 as far as that trajectory is concerned?
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Matt. Thanks for the question. So, we said on the call in October that more than 2 million people come to Twitter every day that haven't been on the service for 30 days or more; that two-thirds of them have been on Twitter before, but haven't been for at least 30 days, so there's the opportunity to get them to come back more frequently and stay longer when they come. And a third of them have never been on Twitter before.
Those numbers have been really constant for a long time. They're a great way to think about the health of all parts of the funnel and the big opportunity for us to continue to drive increased usage of Twitter as a daily utility. We continue to be focused on the product improvements that we can drive to continue that momentum.
Jack, do you want to talk a little bit about some of the work we're doing on the product side?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah. So, we continue to focus on our core job, which is keeping people informed about the world. And we continue to benefit from applying machine learning and deep learning to the areas of the product where people spend the majority of their time which is the home timeline and also notifications.
We're broadening where we're applying these technologies to more of the surface areas, specifically the discovery surface areas of the app. So, one of the things that – a number of you may have noticed is a Happening Now module at the top of your timeline. So, as we get indication that you are interested in a particular team, for instance, and that team is currently playing, we will put a call-out right at the top of your timeline which you can tap into and actually see the scores or stats from the game live and also all the conversation and all the commentary from the game as well.
This is a first step in a much more cohesive strategy around events that's both inclusive of all the conversation, but also potentially live video if we have access to that. And this is – we've been talking a lot about topics and following interest in the past. This is one manifestation of that that we're really excited about. And we think it really gets to the heart of why people come to Twitter in the first place, which is to follow their interest and follow what's happening. So, we're looking more and more in 2018 at making interest and topics and events a lot easier to follow and see what's going on.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. And one follow-up for me, if I could. CPE looked like it was down, it was down 42% year-over-year. It looks like that's in the same ballpark as 3Q. Could you talk about the puts and takes for that metric going forward?
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
So, we don't give guidance around a number like that, but you're right, Matt, that CPE has been down consistently over the course of 2017. That was largely driven by mix shift, the ongoing mix shift towards video, which is our largest ad format and continued to grow this past quarter. CPE is an important input to the improved ROI that we're able to deliver for advertisers.
The other part is the ad engagements which were up 75% this past quarter. When advertisers are getting lower costs and higher clickthrough rates and more engagements due to better ad formats, higher relevance and more audience and engagement, they get a better ROI on Twitter. We've seen our CPMs be really healthy and we expect the CPM trend to continue and we try to think more about CPMs than we do about the inputs; that is CPE or other things.
Matt Diamond - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Duly noted. Thanks so much, guys.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Matt.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Greenfield at BTIG. Rich, please go ahead.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thanks. A couple questions. First, if you're doing your job, Jack, I presume we should never have to go to an Explore tab or I know a lot of people have talked about, couldn't they just create a video tab for all the live video? I assume if you're doing your job right, you should show me exactly what I want to see, tweets, whether that's tweets or video right in the news feed as I'm scrolling through. Wondering as you look back on kind of the product progress you've made over the last year, how would you grade yourself and the company's progress against that goal? Number one.
And then, two, it seems like this year you've got some pretty large kind of big events in the U.S., obviously midterm elections. But thinking globally, Olympics starting later today and the World Cup this summer, just wondering how that kind of impacts kind of quarterly results when you think about year-over-year on a global basis. Thanks.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah. So, your first question, I think, had multiple parts which is serving our job around keeping people informed and really meeting people where they are in the timeline. One of the things to note is that the Explore tab for us is a way for us to test a lot of concepts and experiments and we've been playing around within that tab and as we get better and better signals after people exhaust their timeline and go to Explore to find what else is happening, we can utilize that to actually get a lot more confident around what to put in the timeline.
So, the Happening Now module at the top of the timeline is one such example where we are testing and experimenting with sports, in particular, around making sure that when people are interested in a particular team or a particular event, it appears right at the top of their timeline, so they notice it, they can tap into it. If we have a live video associated with it, it's right there and it starts playing automatically with a score, but they see the conversation, they see all the commentary and can also share that as well.
So, as we learn more and as we continue to get a lot more confident around the signals and get better and better at applying technologies like machine learning and deep learning, you'll see more transition from Explore to the timeline. And our goal is to make the timeline more personalized and a lot more relevant to people, so you're right.
As we continue to do our job better, you'll see more and more of that in the timeline right where you open up the app and where you spend the majority of the time. And that has been a big focus for us for the past two years is adding more relevance to the timeline and to those notifications. So, I think we've been doing a really good job at that because in order to do that, we also had to make that the infrastructure was ready for it.
And we've been cleaning up a lot of that and making sure that we can scale and also building up a discipline that we can apply machine learning to every surface area of the product, and I feel really confident in our ability to do that. And that allows us to move a whole lot faster in 2018 and be a lot smarter about how we introduce tweets and also events and accounts to people right where they spend the majority of their time, which is in the timeline.
I'll turn it over to Ned for the tentpole events.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Rich, so you asked about events coming up in 2018, a couple thoughts there. The first is, there are events in any given period that can be positive drivers for the business, both in driving people to Twitter or the event that's happening on Twitter or just the conversations happening on Twitter. In the fourth quarter, we lapped things like the election and the NFL football and still were able to grow our O&O advertising revenues 7% year-over-year. That was a big source of pride for us.
When we look ahead, you're right, there are a number of events coming up this year and those are great opportunities for us. At the same time, we're seeing their impact be less so than it might have been in previous periods because people are buying Twitter as an always-on ad buy because people are buying over longer periods of time as opposed to just for a given day. And as the business and the revenues become increasingly global, some of these national tentpole events, they're still positive drivers, but their impact on the business more broadly can be less so than it might have been in the past.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Maybe I was unclear. I actually didn't mean it from a revenue standpoint. I mean the color is great. I was actually just thinking from a user acquisition issue, it seems like historically some of these big events have been very useful in driving traffic towards Twitter...
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
That's right.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
... in terms of just actual users.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Yes, that's right, Rich, and that ought to continue to be the case. I'll give you some live stats, by the way, which give you a sense for one of the things that we're doing on the audience and engagement side to continue to drive the numbers and also to improve the dialogue with advertisers as we give them new things to advertise against on Twitter.
We streamed more than 1,100 events in the fourth quarter, up from 830 in Q3. We had 22 new live-streaming partnerships, including 9 international deals. Bloomberg's TicToc is a great example of one of those. It's a 24/7 news network which, about a month in, is averaging 750,000 daily views and more than 50 million tweet impressions since its launch.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin, please go ahead.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. My question is really on time spent on Twitter. Is that something you monitor or find important? And then, when you look at your time spent or activity per user, how do you think about long-term monetization versus, say, Facebook or some other social companies out there? Do you think you have lot of room ahead on either ad loads or just where you are now versus maybe Facebook? Thank you.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thanks for the question. We feel good about where we are from a time spent perspective, but what we really talk about when we think about audience and engagement and the best way to measure the usage of Twitter as a daily utility is that DAU growth, which was up double-digits for the fifth consecutive quarter. We try not to focus too much on any one metric underneath that when we look at engagement because it might put too much attention on it relative to others.
You asked about ad load. Ad load is typically higher in the fourth quarter given seasonal demand. It sometimes drops in the first quarter as well. When you take a step back, though, we think that overall we continue to be more demand-constrained than supply-constrained across the business. When you look at the fourth quarter and you see clickthrough rates having continued to improve and cost per engagement having continued to come down, that's driven better ROI for advertisers and has been a big driver for us.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Eric Sheridan at UBS. Eric, please go ahead.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks so much for taking the question. Now that we're getting to GAAP profitability, we're also throwing off a lot of free cash flow within the company. How do you revisit or think about the cash you have on the balance sheet? What the best means are to allocate that capital either to drive inorganic growth through M&A or thinking about returning capital to shareholders? Just love to get a general sense of what the framework is there as you think through your balance sheet. Thanks so much, guys.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks for the question. We're really pleased with the $550 million of free cash flow that we generated for the year and we try to every quarter look at our capital structure and make sure that it's appropriate for the business and the opportunities that we see and there are no changes to our thinking today. So, nothing new to report there, Eric.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And we will take our next question from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of (27:18), and (27:20) asks, is there less confusion for new users since you've expanded the character limit?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, (27:26). So, we have completed the launch of 280, so it's out to 100% of all existing and everyone new to the service. And just to remind people of why we did it; one of the things that we're seeing is that people would bounce up against the 140-character limit consistently and actually abandon tweets completely. So, we wanted to experiment with giving them a little bit more room, and one of the things we're watching for is to see if the average tweet size would go up as a result and it has not.
People do have – we're seeing less abandonment of tweets, but we're also seeing a lot more engagement. We're seeing a lot more retweets and we're seeing a lot more mentions and we're also seeing people get more followers and return more often. So, we do believe that it is minimizing some of the complexities and some of the confusion around Twitter, in general, but more importantly it's enabling people to be a lot more expressive and share what's on their minds and that little bit of room extra has really proven to help.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much. And our next question comes from Mark May at Citi. Mark, please go ahead.
Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions. First, you've signed a number of live content partnerships over the last year or two and I was wondering if you could comment on what impact those have had on the advertising side of the business. And then secondly, you guided for expenses to grow at a similar rate as revenue this year, but just to calibrate expectations, I think the margin comparisons are far easier in the first half versus the second half. So, the question is, is it fair to expect at least in the near term we'll continue to see the benefits on margins on a year-on-year basis from the recent expense rationalizations that you've been pursuing in 2017? Thanks.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Mark. I'll take the first question. So, it's had a positive impact on the advertisement side. We're definitely seeing a lot of positive sentiment around live and our streaming efforts, mainly because it really fits perfectly with Twitter's value. People come to us to see what's happening and to understand what's going on in the world based on their interest, and live video helps us be one of the fastest places to see what's happening, but more importantly generates a conversation and shows the commentary associated with it.
One of the things that is really important to us is continuing to broaden our live strategy more towards events, as I talked about previously on the call, so that whatever event is happening, whatever topic and interest that you're interested in, you can quickly get to the conversation and the commentary. In some cases, we will have an associated live stream or multiple live streams associated with that topic or that interest or that event, but no matter what, you always see the conversation and you always see the top commentary from experts within whatever field that it has to do with. So, we continue to see a lot of benefit from the strategy and we're really excited to improve and build upon it.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Mark. On your expense question, so we gave guidance for the quarter for EBITDA and for EBITDA margins and in a seasonal business like ours where the expense base might be growing from one period to the next as we add head count to invest in our priorities, the opportunity for margin expansion comes from higher revenues, which sometimes you see from seasonal strength and other things.
When we look out over the course of the year, we think that our expenses ought to more closely align with revenue than they have in the past. That was the comment in the letter that I think you're referring to as we invest for growth in 2018, but it wasn't. We didn't talk much about the quarters and how it ought to play out. We just gave you guidance for the first quarter.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. So, we will take our next question from Ron Josey at JMP Securities. Ron, please go ahead.
Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Jack, I think you mentioned talking about investing in sales in addition to product and just wondering if you can provide additional color here in terms of how sales are situated given efficiencies improving, direct responses getting better, that'd be great. Thank you.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
So, we're pretty happy with our execution of the sales team and overall around the partnerships team, and we continue to see a lot of strength in that team. We made a move recently with having Matt Derella, who is our VP of Global Revenue and Operations, to lead our sales efforts and also take on additional responsibilities around live and content partnerships. So, we're combining strengths there and this is a natural progression for Matt, as he brings a really commercial mindset and will work hand in hand with the product team to make sure that we're creating partnerships that benefit everyone on Twitter. So, we're pretty happy with where we are, the execution and all the discipline that we've driven around the team.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Matt, I'll add a – or sorry, Ron, I'll add a couple things to that. We are investing in sales right now because we see opportunity out there to continue to improve the dialogue with advertisers. We have such a different conversation with them now, whether it's an upfront conversation or otherwise than we had a year ago given the improved ad format, given the improved audience and engagement and the better ROI that our salespeople are able to talk to advertisers about. Those things have emboldened us to continue to invest in sales. Our attrition numbers have come down in sales recently and we'll add head count there over the course of the year.
Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And we'll take the next question from Mark Mahaney at RBC. Mark, please go ahead.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Two things; one, do you need to do any backfilling in terms of senior management with Noto moving on? And then secondly, in the past I think in terms of international markets, I think you called out a few, I think Japan was one where you think you've had really good progress. Any updates on what may have contributed to the MAU growth in international markets? And/or that DAU growth, is there anything to call out there in terms of particular international markets that are driving that? Thank you.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Mark. We're not going to have to do any backfilling of the team with Anthony's departure. This is a testament to what Anthony has built, the strength of the bench, and the strength of the bench of the executive team as well. So, executives from my team will be assuming a bunch of his roles. And we haven't skipped a beat, and we're really excited about looking at this org in a new way, but we have a lot of strength around the table and a lot of confidence to continue the strategy.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
On international, Mark, a couple things to share. On the revenue side, we saw strength in all of our geographies this past quarter, so we were about flat in the United States and we grew in every other region. We saw particular strength in Japan and in Asia Pacific. And Asia Pacific, in particular, the strength came from the China export market where we continue to help the Chinese brands export their message outside of China. But Europe grew as well. And seeing the breadth of improvement as we returned to revenue growth was a real source of pride for us.
If you flip over and look at audience and engagement we grew, in 5 of our 10 largest markets we grew double-digits and that demonstrates the breadth of the ongoing improvement in audience and engagement. Things like Twitter Lite, it's still early days growing off of a small base, but that helps us in some of the emerging markets, and the product improvements that Jack talked about are things that help us all over the world.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great, thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley. Brian, please go ahead.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. As the very good O&O advertising growth in the quarter, just be curious for any more color on which specific ad categories or ad verticals kind of outside of DR that drove the strength. Then on the plan, the sales force, where do you see the biggest opportunities among the advertising categories to really drive incremental share in 2018?
And then the second one on the investments as we think about 2018, Jack, can you just talk to some of the friction points you still see that are causing the 2 million daily visitors to not really stick around and use Twitter as the utility that it should be and that you're focused on fixing? Thanks.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
So, on the ad formats, we saw strength across all of our major ad formats. Brand was a big driver. Jack talked about direct response as well. We are really pleased with the execution there and the fact that the success was broad-based. On sales, can you just repeat that part of the question, Brian? I want to make sure I answer it well.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. It's if there's any specific verticals or categories of branded advertisers that you really see an opportunity to send more salespeople forward and saying you need to spend more on Twitter, whether it's travel or CPG, just kind of thinking about the advertiser category.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
So, the strength we saw from advertisers was also broad-based this quarter, but you can imagine if you're launching a product, if you had somebody's product on your network, if you were advertising towards consumers during the holiday season, Twitter was a great place to do that. But the success that we saw was broad-based.
We mentioned in the past that our top 100 advertisers grew in the U.S. and internationally. That continued to be the case in the fourth quarter. And a lot of the work now is taking the message and the execution that has resonated so well with those top 100 advertisers and extending that to a broader group of advertisers. And so, some of this is just having more people on the ground to get that great message out there as opposed to thinking about specific verticals.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And, Brian, on the point of friction, it becomes increasingly clear that people come to Twitter with a very specific purpose which does not look like a similar purpose as they would expect from a social network. So, people come to Twitter because they're interested in something. They're interested in following what's happening within that interest or within that topic, and one of the things that we don't do well today is match them with that interest very quickly.
So, we're looking at onboarding as one area and specifically the sign-up flow to make sure that we take into consideration the context that they're in, where they are, when they're coming in and what they're interested in and matching them with that interest as quickly as possible. Less and less having to do with specific accounts that they follow and more and more having to do with matching them with that interest and topics.
So, everything that we're exploring in the Explore tab and around events really speaks to a bunch of this work and we're learning a ton as we introduce these new experiments about how to introduce people and at what point to introduce people to these interests and to these topics. So, the biggest push for us is really to make sure that we have a really compelling events experience and an interest experience and then to match people with those interests as quickly as possible as they come in and we're really excited about what we're going to be able to do in 2018.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
That's helpful. Thank you both.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Twitter, comes from the account of (40:05), and (40:07) asks, is there any update on monetizing TweetDeck?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you for the question. No update today. We're always looking at how people are using TweetDeck. It's a fantastic product, especially for higher volume usage. We see a lot of usage with brands and also in newsrooms and we're looking at opportunities there, but no update today.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
It is just a great example of the ways that we think about further monetizing the platform, the data and enterprise solutions business is the best example of that where we continued to see strength in the fourth quarter. But as Jack mentioned, nothing new to share on TweetDeck.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And we have time, I think, for just one last question, and that question comes from Brent Thill at Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead.
Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC
Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on Ned's comment, what you're seeing outside the top 100. Is there a little more color in terms of some of the metrics and the momentum that you're seeing as those advertisers come on the platform?
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
So, the success with the top 100 advertisers has been driven by a few things. And if I don't get to your question, then just come back around and I'll make sure that that I'm answering it. We think about – the message that's really resonated with them has been the improved audience and engagement, the better ad formats and improved relevance, which have led to better ROI.
The sales execution, which is just making sure that we're out telling the story and that we're measuring the success and impact that we're having with advertisers, has had a big difference and that's one of the things that's led to our confidence that allows us to make 2018 a year where we invest to grow at Twitter. It does bring to mind something else, Brent, which I should just share. When we look out over the course of this year, we think that the sequential growth rates for total revenue ought to look a lot more like 2016 than they did like 2017 given what a year 2017 was and all the puts and takes that there were.
Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC
And just to clarify just in terms of the onboarding for the small and mid-sized businesses, can you just talk a little bit about the initiatives going forward and the momentum that you're seeing there?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah. So, in terms of a self-service, it's still very early, but we're really excited about this opportunity, so we have millions of small and medium-sized businesses on the service and we made two moves recently. One was with the tweet composer. We launched a new Promoted Tweet composer and that simplifies the process of creating a new Promoted Tweet. It drove 23% increase in spend on Twitter among advertisers who had access.
We also moved into beta from alpha our Twitter Promote Mode, which is a subscription advertising product. We entered into public beta in the U.S., UK and Japan and the early results have been really positive. We've seen significantly better retention among the subscribers, so we're going to continue to look at these results and iterate those two products and look for opportunities for more.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 earnings conference call. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; COO, Anthony Noto and CFO, Ned Segal. We hope you've had a chance to read our Shareholder Letter published on our Investor Relations website this morning. Like last quarter, we'll begin with just a few prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions.
During the Q&A, we'll take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the #TWTR.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call such as our outlook for Q4 and the full year of 2017 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please also take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially.
The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our Shareholder Letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. And an audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Before we take questions, I want to highlight a few things. We had a good quarter and made progress in three key areas of our business. We grew our audience and engagement, made progress on a return to revenue growth and achieved record profitability. I'll outline these in a bit more detail for you.
First, our audience and engagement are growing. Our monthly and daily active usage grew year-over-year, as well as sequentially. Importantly, this growth was broad based, both in the United States and internationally, with growth in the majority of our top 10 markets. And as we said last quarter, product improvements continue to drive audience and engagement growth. Our work to increase relevance and make Twitter easier is making an impact.
Second, this quarter, we made progress on a return to revenue growth. Growth was driven by improved execution from our sales team, strength in video and direct response ad formats, and continued strength in our data business, where we saw our third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. And third, we achieved record profitability in Q3. We continued to improve our GAAP net margin and delivered our highest adjusted EBITDA margin to-date. This profitability reflects our improved prioritization and disciplined execution across all of our strategic priorities.
In addition to the progress we made in audience and engagement growth, revenue growth and profitability, we're more focused than ever on making Twitter a safe place for everyone. We made this a priority in 2016, updating our policies and increasing the size of our teams. And in 2017, we rolled out a number of product updates, with an increased sense of urgency. We know this isn't enough, and we're taking a more aggressive stance in our abuse rules and how we enforce them.
We're addressing this from a policy, enforcement and product perspective. And just last week, published a calendar of the upcoming safety work we have planned through January 2018. This is the first time we've shared this level of visibility into our work, and we hope it builds trust along the way.
Finally, along with our COO, Anthony, we're also joined by our CFO, Ned, for his first earnings call with us, and we're excited to have him. I'll turn it over to him to say a few words.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be here to discuss the quarter with you. As Jack said, this quarter, our audience and engagement grew, we're making progress on a return to revenue growth, and we achieved record profitability. We got a great opportunity ahead of us to put Twitter in as many people's hands as possible and to make the service more relevant to more people every day. And with that, Jack, Anthony and I look forward to taking your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great, thank you. And our first question comes from Heath Terry at Goldman Sachs.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Hi, Heath.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks, Ned and Krista. Curious if you could give us a little bit more sense about sort of your long-term margin goals, given the upside margins we saw this quarter, the guidance for next quarter, is there a point where you feel comfortable with the level of profitability that this business is seeing, to the extent that you're going to want to reinvest more, whether it's in technology, marketing, people? And then also, just on revenue growth, is there also a point that we're getting to, with some of the restructuring that you've been doing in your advertising products, where we start to see advertising growth aligned more with growth in advertising impressions, or at least growth in DAUs?
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Heath. I'll take the first question and Anthony will take the second one. On margins, there's no change to our long-term thinking, and we made great progress this quarter towards our goals. We are at the point though where, after a lot of hard decisions made over the last couple of years and an expense base that's come down quite a bit, where the expense base will selectively grow as we invest against our priorities. So, to the extent you see margin improvement, it's more likely to come from revenue growth than it is from cutting the expense base. As you said, we want to make sure that we're investing appropriately against the opportunities that we see.
Let me turn it to Anthony to talk about the revenue side and ads.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Ned, and good morning, Heath. So, I want to address your question about revenue growth, and will we start to see a trend towards our audience growth. And before doing so, I figured it would be good to give you just an update on how we feel about the progress that we're making in a return to revenue growth overall, and what's driving it.
First message I'd like to send is that we feel really good about the progress we've made. We're ahead of where I would have guessed back in January today. And the progress that we're making falls into three areas. First is value for our advertisers, value for our content owners, and value for our enterprise partners, strong execution, and diversification of revenue. I'm going to focus specifically on value. We have a much larger audience. It's growing. It's growing consistently. We have much lower prices, and we have better products that are performing better. All of that equals better ROI.
Let me take each one of those one by one. First, audience growth. We've had six quarters of solid growth in daily active users, with the last four quarters up double-digits, and that's against an increasingly tough comparison. Having audience growth is really important for our partners, both in the advertising and on the content side, so they are confident investing in a platform that they know is going to continue to grow. And importantly, as Jack mentioned, that growth is driven by product changes, in addition to other factors.
Second, our prices. Our prices are down meaningfully, measured by cost per engagement. They're down more than 40% on a year-over-year basis in aggregate, driven by mix shift, but importantly, significant year-over-year declines on a like-for-like basis. Bigger audience, lower prices is better value.
Third, we have better performing products. We went through the painstaking process of eliminating some of our products in our portfolio that we didn't think we could win with, that we didn't think were good for advertisers. Our teams also invested a lot in our platform. The combination of those two things allow our products to perform better for our partners with higher click-through rates year-over-year on a like-for-like basis. Bigger audience and lower prices, better performing ads, more value.
And then last, we have a really differentiated portfolio of products. Right now, our team is focused on communicating to our advertisers the strength we have in our video products. We have four really differentiated products. One of which we launched in the fourth quarter, which is a Video Card view that was used by Apple in its most recent campaigns.
Those differentiated products, combined with a bigger audience, lower prices, and better performing ads, has really helped. And so we feel good about the direction that we're going and the progress that we made. And a year ago, we had to talk about the fact that our audience was growing, and it would take a while for revenue growth to start to mirror that, and we feel like we're making progress to that, and we're on the precipice of seeing a real improvement.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan. Doug, please go ahead.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up there with two. First, Anthony, can you talk – and Ned – can you just talk about whether you think you can grow ad revenue in 4Q, excluding the headwinds from TellApart and the NFL? And then if you can talk a little bit qualitatively about how you think that sets you up into 2018?
And then, Anthony, you talked about CPE. It's basically been down, I think, between 40% and 60% roughly in each of the last nine quarters. And conversely, you've gotten a triple-digit engagement growth, or impression growth, throughout the same period. A lot happening there in terms of video, in DR, in other mix shifts, also the like-for-like you mentioned. But when does that start to kind of stabilize more going forward? Thanks.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey Doug, it's Ned. I'll start, then Anthony will chime in. I'll talk a little bit about the fourth quarter first. So I'll just remind you and everyone that we don't give revenue guidance. We give EBITDA guidance and guidance for EBITDA margins, but we do recognize that people will do math to back into other parts of the P&L.
Our EBITDA guidance is meant to reflect what we believe are the most likely ranges of outcomes. And if you were to do the math and compare it to prior periods, you'd recognize that when you – let me just go back to a point that Anthony made in July, where he mentioned $75 million of headwinds in the second half of the year. I'll break it out for you.
It was $20 million of TellApart in Q3, $40 million of TellApart in Q4, and $15 million of tough comps in Live in Q4. If you remove TellApart and you do some math around the last couple of quarters, just to ground you a little more, Q3 saw a 1% decline in revenue and Q2 saw a 2% decline in revenue. The ranges of outcomes that you could back into for the fourth quarter would include growth ex TellApart.
Having said that, it's too early for us to call where we will end up with much of the quarter to play out, in November and December we'll get most of our revenue for the fourth quarter. And as you can imagine, there are lots of puts and takes from one year to the next. Along with the TellApart, there's also the presidential election and live Thursday Night Football, which don't repeat themselves this quarter and then there are things that will happen this quarter that didn't happen in the fourth quarter of last year. So, it's early to predict when we'll return to revenue growth, but you better believe we're doing everything that we're working hard to make it happen.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
So, Doug, to your question about how we're setting up for 2018 and the fourth quarter, and then I'll talk about CPE question. Our goal is to overcome every headwind that we have, and we're working everyday to do that. We're going to the fourth quarter very well-positioned. It's really just about execution. We have been able to really increase the portfolio of Live product that we have in content. We have had over 850 events in this most recent quarter, which is a significant increase versus the prior quarters, and the selection is now broad-based.
It's international, it's not just domestic. We hope to leverage that in a number of product initiatives as it relates to industry and video, and pre-roll video as we go into the fourth quarter, in addition to just the continued progress that we're making on product improvements. So, we're going to do everything we can to overcome those headwinds, and we're focused on getting back to growth.
What will it take to get back to growth as we go into 2018? I think it's all about execution and continued diversification of our revenue. We like to focus on people, processes and technology. I went through the value that we're starting to really communicate well to our partners. We have the right products. We have the right value. It's about making sure each one of our partners understands that, and we are making great progress in that regard, and I'll give you some numbers to support it. But before doing so, it's people on the ground calling on the right clients, calling on them frequently enough, having the right conversations and showing them that our product works, and that's what our team is doing.
In fact, our top 100 advertisers globally in the quarter were up 23% year-over-year. So as you peel the onion a few layers, you start to see growth at the next layer or two down that will start to service itself, so top 100 advertisers globally up 23%, top 100 advertisers in the U.S., up 7%.
As it relates to communicating the value and proving it, this quarter we conducted 43% more custom-advertising studies in Q3 2017 than we had in the same time period in 2016. It was a combination of both third-party measurement studies, as well as our team's investment in self-serve, and we'll do more of that.
The second factor which we haven't talked about is diversification of our revenue. Our Data Enterprise Solution business accelerated for the third consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. We still are very optimistic about the growth opportunities we have in that product category.
And then our self-serve advertising business is a relatively large business. It's a high margin business because there's not a lot of people given that it's self-served through our online platform. That business returned to growth this quarter as well. So making really strong progress in a number of areas, and it really comes down to execution given we have the right value equation for advertisers.
As it relates to 2018 and as it relates to CPE, what I'd say is this. We think about CPE as a combination, we think about CPE in the context of yield, so effective CPM. An effective CPM is nothing more than the product of CTR, click-through rate, times CPE, cost per engagement.
Our effective CPM has been relatively stable the last three quarters, and we think it will remain relatively stable all else equal in the competitive environment, and that's how we think about CPE in the context of yield to the platform, and we're glad that it's reached the stability point because now it will allow us to just drive incremental demand against the existing volume that's growing to get back (15:00) to revenue growth.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you both.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian at R. W. Baird. Colin, please go ahead.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks, guys. I have a couple of questions. First, I just wanted to mention on a personal note that during the wildfires here, Twitter was a very useful source of communication and a real-time information for my family, so I appreciate that.
In terms of the questions, first off, wondering what the one or two most important factors were in driving the increase in DAU growth and engagement? You cited a couple of factors in the release. And then, more specifically, on the Explore tab, I'm wondering how usage and time spent compares with the core timeline, in particular among new or more casual users? Thanks.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks for the question, Colin. Our audience growth in Q3 benefited from all three levers that we talked about: organic growth, product and marketing. They're all meaningful, and their contributions will vary in any given period. Our product changes though should continue to drive improvement in audience and engagement, and they should compound over time.
Let me turn it to Jack to talk about the specific product changes that we are making that are driving growth.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And thank you for the mention of the use during the (16:14) wildfires. We saw the same sort of utility. I'll touch a little bit on, more broadly, what we're interested in and it relates to the Explore tab. Explore is a way for us to organize around topics and interests. You'll find Search there, you'll find Moments, you'll find topic modules, which we just launched, which is what we infer you might be interested in, and some of the best tweets and accounts that you see there, and of course, Trends.
We're playing a lot with better matching people with their interests and with topics that they care about within this. This is an area of experimentation. We're experimenting very, very quickly to figure out the right approach. And then as we learn more, bring that more into the timeline, and you'll see some of those experiments going forward.
One of the things we're excited about is, we just launched the What's Happening Now module, which is focused today on sports. So if you're interested in baseball, for instance, you would have seen a call out at the top of your timeline to see the discussion and the conversation around the game last night.
And as this gets better and better and we get more personalized, we'll continue to see results not only in daily active, but across the board. We do believe that as we personalize Twitter more and as we continue to add more selection and continue to show off the conversation, it has a direct impact on our results, so that's where we're focused.
It always comes back to the job we're serving and making sure that we are showing people what's going on, what's happening right now and keeping them informed, both when they're in their app, through the timeline and Explore, and also when they're out through notifications.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great, thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research. Brian, please go ahead.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Going into the data licensing and other segment, I was wondering if you could talk about the growth trend between MoPub versus your data licensing. And then, separately, you mentioned the new customer success team providing support to top 5% of advertisers in the letter, driving 40% revenue lift. I'm wondering if you could talk about how broad do you think you can profitably extend sort of extended customer support and just sort of rollout plans for that and if you think that's going to continue to add some incremental growth?
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
So, I'll start on data licensing, then you'll hear from Anthony. On the data licensing, we don't break out data licensing relative to MoPub, but it's important to point out around data licensing that we saw our third straight quarter of accelerating growth. We're really pleased with the progress there, and we feel like there's a lot of room in front of us, both as we continue to expand the product that we offer, that we bring it to more customers, and we expand our relationship with our existing customers, that continues to be an area of focus for us, one that adds visibility and growth to our opportunity.
Anthony, do you want to talk about the top five advertisers?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah. And Brian, could you just restate your question? I'm not sure I understood it clearly, your second question as it relates to top 100 advertisers?
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Sure. There's a note in the letter that says that you've launched a new customer success team that provided support to your top 5% of advertisers. You mentioned already the top 100 advertisers increased their spending level, that was certainly well in excess of the rest of the company. But to the extent that providing a customer success team contributed to extra growth, I'm just wondering if you plan to broaden this customer success team, or if this sort of a – just further thoughts around that, that would be useful to hear.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. And just to clarify your point. The comment or letter about the top five advertisers and customer success is for our self-service advertising business, and none of our self-serving advertising partners fall into our top 100, so it's a different group and a different channel. So they're both showing positive trends but they're not – they're different.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Thanks for clarifying that.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Let me talk about the self-served business for a second. The business did grow in the third quarter. It has benefited from a really strong leadership from our team both on the business side and importantly on the product side and the combination of those two working together I think bodes really well for incremental growth.
As you know, we do not have millions of advertisers like our competitive peers and a big reason why we do not is we haven't had a turn-it-on forget-it type of advertising product, an always on advertising product.
We think the self-serve channel has the potential to be that. And so we're investing in that area to see if we can find a good product market fit. So in addition to the customer success team, we've also made investments on onboarding and we've made investments in a new subscription product that for $99 you don't have to pick what ad formats you want to use on Twitter. We do all that for you.
We get you account follows, our technology machine learning gets you impressions and you get a value back that we've delivered 100% for you, so it literally is a subscription product like you'd use in other formats.
It's early. It's being tested but the initial signs are promising and that's as a result of the innovation of our product team and our leadership team. The 5% of our top advertisement customer success, I would say, we'll continue to invest in that area but incrementally and very cautiously.
We don't want to add cost to that business relative to its profitability and the contribution mix relative to the overall business unless it's warranted. But it is one of the things that we've done to drive an improvement.
And then just the last thing I mentioned onboarding, we shipped a new version of our campaign set-up experience which made it much easier for new advertisers to get started and for existing advertisers to launch better campaigns. That drove a higher conversion rate for new advertisers and higher average revenue per advertiser from both new and returning markets, so more product innovation driving more adoption with a better product market fit.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Great. Thank you so much.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. Our next question comes from Twitter. It'll come from the Twitter account of TmsJmo (22:29) and he asks, have you received any feedback from video partners that discovery of live video is not optimal. And do you have any thoughts on how to improve it?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Our Live business is just anniversarying its first year. It's a very different strategy than our competitors. And I think it's important to understand that strategy and the value that we provide for partners because it plays into your question.
So to be very clear, our Live strategy is about leveraging a strength that existed on Twitter for the last decade and that's a strength that we've had passionate audiences about specific topics already talking about things that are happening in the world even though the video was not on the platform it was someplace else.
We've been leveraging that strength to pick the right content to meet the passionate needs of those audiences. And we combined their conversation that already exists on Twitter all over everyone's timeline into one curated timeline with the video there.
The idea is to make our content being delivered faster, it's to drive more selection, it's to drive more discussion and more personalization and in doing so, we think we can help content owners and advertisers extend the reach that they have in television to people that either are at home to watch or people that do not pay for television.
And we've been able to prove to our content partners that we are extending their reach, it's an incremental audience they wouldn't otherwise get. It's an incremental reach for advertisers. So it's not a replacement strategy at all. It's not a strategy that is trying to dis-intermediate the content owners from the advertisers or from the audience. And that has worked really well for us, and that's why we've had such strong increase in selection on a year-over-year basis.
As it relates specifically to your question about discovery, the real question is, are we delivering the audience scale that they want? And are we delivering the value that they want in advertising? And I think the best way to answer that question is just the significant growth that we've had across sports, news and entertainment.
We had 830 events in the quarter that was up versus 625 events in Q2. We saw growth in the unique users of the product and we saw growth internationally and domestically in terms of selection and so really proud of what the team has done there. But individually we deliver value for each content owner and that's how we measure it.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. So our next question comes from Rich Greenfield at BTIG. Rich, please go ahead.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question, so two. First, just on the DAU front, when you gave your last update I think in Q2, you had mentioned that DAUs were tracking up 12% through the month of July and you reported 14%. So that would indicate that you kind of exited the quarter with north of 15% growth in the back two months. Just wondering, is that correct that you did see a notable pick up in the back end or in second or the back two-thirds of the quarter. If there's anything that specifically drove that and anything you can tell us about those trends as you go up against even tougher comps in Q4?
And then just, I want to come back to this video question because I'm less interested in live video discovery. I mean, I know you're working on that but just video discovery in general, like whether it's a live video or a piece of content that aired a few weeks ago, finding video, there's a lot of great video that whether it was live or whether it happened this morning, you still care about, how you're going to surface that video? I mean is there going to be a dedicated video experience or just, there's so much content that has value beyond live that I'm curious how you're thinking about servicing that? Thanks.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Rich, I'll start on DAU and then Jack will talk about discovery broadly. So the comment on the Q2 earnings call was really meant to be directional. I wouldn't want you to takeaway that we were exactly at 12%, or to try to break the months apart. Although we generally expect organic growth, product, and marketing to continue to drive DAU higher in subsequent periods, I don't think it makes sense to break them out, as they're all meaningful and their contributions will vary in any given period. And they all contributed this past quarter. Go ahead Jack.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
In terms of video discovery, the way we are thinking about this is just adding more personalization across the board to Twitter. So our biggest efforts are really applying machine learning and deep learning to every single tweet; some tweets carry text, some tweets carry images, some tweets carry video, and we want to make sure that if we infer, or you explicitly tell us you're interested in something, that we're delivering the right media format for you at the right time. Sometimes that is text, sometimes that is an image, sometimes that is video, and then want to go even deeper and really understand a video as well.
So, we are thinking about this more from a broad based perspective, and being somewhat format agnostic so that we can make sure that we're delivering what is something that matters to people, and something that is going to really feed what their interest is in particular.
So if you're looking at this, making this a lot easier, we're exploring a lot and experimenting a lot in the Explore tab. But also, we want to make sure that this blends into your timeline, so that people don't have to do any work to find what matters to them.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Meaning that the ultimate goal, Jack, is that you won't even need to use the Explore tab because you'll be good enough, from an AI standpoint, to show me what I want to see in the main tab?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Correct, correct. Our goal is personalizing and getting this right so that we're delivering something that really matters to you in whatever format it comes through.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
And where would you say the AI team is in terms of size, growth and kind of against that effort?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
We've had a lot of strength in our AI discipline, machine learning, and deep learning in particular. For the past year-and-a-half, we've really been applying it to the core aspects of the product. So we feel really good about the size of the team and the depth of the team. But we're hiring, and we continue to look for leadership in all these areas. But I feel really confident in our application and our expertise.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley at Deutsche Bank. Lloyd, please go ahead.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. I guess one for Anthony. You talked about growing audience, better product, and lower pricing, make the product work better for advertisers. So wondering, as you see advertisers who are coming back to Twitter, perhaps after a period away, how are you seeing spend levels trend from these advertisers coming back to better product and lower prices?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
What I'd say is, it's different by market, so I don't want to give you a one answer because the averages kind of mask what's happening in each individual market. Let's take the Japanese market as an example. It's our second strongest market. We do disclose the revenue there. It's greater than 10%.
Our Japanese revenue accelerated this quarter on a year-over-year basis. It accelerated because our team is focused on a by-product approach and by-advertiser approach. And as we see the growth in spend for advertisers slowing, and the growth in number of advertisers slowing, we look at what opportunities we have to sell more of a broad array of our products to meet the needs of those advertisers.
And so one of the key things that we did in Japan in the most recent quarter is, we increased the strength of other products that are really complementary and in fact, one of those is a video product. The Japanese market, it has historically been a DR market, which is in contrast to rest of our business, which is largely a brand business, and now we're starting to see the uptake of our video products in the Japanese market by branded advertisers, because the product is strong. The prices are really competitive, and our targeting is better and we have a really big audience there.
And so each market is going to be different, but I'll just tell you, in the Japanese market, it's about broadening the products that the advertisers buy, and those products are broadening because they're valuable and they're valuable across the three dimensions that I mentioned.
So each market we're focused on, I like to say SKU level, the ad products that are available to purchase. What are they buying? Are they the right products for that advertiser, are they the right price. And can we deliver the right ROI? And then that's the approach we're taking.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from John Blackledge at Cowen.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. Just a couple questions. I think the direct response format was called out as a driver of top line. Could you discuss, perhaps in more detail, the drivers of improvement in the DR channel and did DR advertising grow on a year-over-year basis and then maybe if you could just explain the change in the MAU reporting and why the change now? Thank you.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. On the direct response question, we did have a strong quarter in direct response and mobile application download. We also had strength in video. In Map (31:24) in particular, we saw a strength this quarter from an increased launch of new games and apps.
This is one area of strength that we've had in mobile application download products. Historically, we haven't had as much success scaling the mobile application download revenue stream as we've would have liked and so we're allocating our resources accordingly. But the Map (31:44) business did have a good quarter on the back of several of our partners with new entrants into the market in the app space, and we can uniquely help them drive penetration given the significant scale that we have. The fact that we're mobile and the fact that we're global and that was the reference in the commentary of the letter.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
And John I'll go into MAU for you. During the quarter we realized that we had included 1 million to 2 million users over the past year of a service for third-party apps in our MAU measurement that should not have been included. It's important to note that since it's a small absolute number on a base of over 300 million MAU that historical growth rates in absolute numbers really don't change very much. And on an adjusted or unadjusted basis we grew 4 million MAU this quarter from 326 million to 330 million with strength in the U.S. and internationally contributing to that 4 million.
You'll remember that DAU wouldn't be affected by this as DAU does not include users of any third-party services in the calculation. While we are on MAU, I'll just point out that although we don't give guidance for MAU or DAU I just want to note that Q4 is typically seasonally weak for MAU. And in addition there is a change to the Safari interface that will affect some third-party apps including Twitter. It impacts our third-party auto polling MAU who aren't served as so don't have revenue tied to them. DAU again wouldn't be affected by a change like this.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler at Barclays. Ross, please go ahead.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, guys. You have two questions. So one on the programmatic you mentioned in the letter that you're in Alpha with the new programmatic ad channel. So this is something that I think you've worked on in the past with different partners et cetera. Can you just talk about this new Alpha what the strategy is and what the success that you're seeing early on, and any color there?
And then the second question on data licensing, can you just talk about within the Gnip business the difference between price increases versus new account growth in terms of driving the overall acceleration there, and do you expect this growth to kind of consistently stay at this level, into 2018 and 2019. Any color there on data licensing would be helpful? Thank you.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. So let me take your programmatic real-time bidding question. I want to emphasize it's very, very early days for us. It's a test. We've talked about previously from a party standpoint as we think about revenue opportunities and prioritization we've talked about tapping into new channels of demand. One new channel of demand is video and tapping into those budgets outside of digital and social. The second opportunity for incremental demand is third-party demand. We think there's a real opportunity to tap into premium display budgets. We do not really tap into those budgets today. We think our RTB product could be very competitive against premium display, budgets and that's the opportunity that we're seeing in front of us from a demand perspective.
On a supply perspective, we have some inventory that's not being sold, we're in a demand constrained environment, not supply constrained environment. So we think we can tap into this third-party demand through programmatic RTB, sell more of our existing inventory in owned and operated. Potentially, I want to emphasize the word in quotes ""potentially"" tap into monetizing our lived out inventory and syndicated inventory. And so that's the rationale behind the initiative. It's very early, we're testing the pipes and technology. Right now we really haven't even rolled out a real Alpha. We're negotiating a number of partnerships with TSPs and I'm only giving that detail so that you don't expect any real impact from this for the foreseeable future because that's how early it is.
But we do think it's a real opportunity and one that's worth investing in. As it relates to your second question, our Data Enterprise Solutions business was one that was acquired over four years ago. It had a specific focus on one use case and we think there's an opportunity to expand outside of that use case, and sell data not just for the ability to understand sentiment analysis and to have Brandwatch types of use cases, but actually use the data to do other things as it relates to delivering the right content to the right user at the right time as it relates to buying media, as it relates to direct marketing.
We haven't started to enter into that type of opportunity yet, but that is the biggest opportunity to drive incremental growth of data partners. The bulk of our growth that you're currently seeing is from our existing customers. And in fact we're going to do business with fewer customers instead of more. And the reason why is because we're focused on the channel strategy and a partnership strategy that results in higher prices for the value that we're creating and more products focused to land and expand.
And so it's not about driving penetration of more data partners in the current execution today, it's about driving fewer partners and more spend partners so they invest more in the opportunities in front of them. We still think there's a significant opportunity in that strategy, but there's also an opportunity to expand our data partners through broader usage and we're just at the very early stages of that. And that hasn't shown up in the results yet.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post at Bank of America. Justin, please go ahead.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. A couple of questions. First, obviously, the DAU ratio to MAU is growing. Can you talk about engagement with new content? Are you seeing time spent increase at a similar ratio per user, and how you're thinking about that? And then, just thinking about growing advertising again next year, I think you've already discussed ad loads, you have more room there but, how do you feel about where you are in ad loads? And when do you think like-for-like pricing could maybe bottom out? Thank you.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
So first on DAU to MAU, I think you're referring back to a comment that we made after the earnings call in July that DAU was less than 50% of MAU; that continues to be the case, and growing DAU inside our existing base of MAU is definitely one of the ways that we can grow DAU. But there's another way as well, which is to grow MAU and turn them into DAU. There's one way that I like to think about that that really helps it come alive, which is that every day, 2 million new users come to Twitter – sorry, 2 million or more new users come to Twitter, of them, two-thirds are users who have not been to Twitter for the last 30 days. And so there's an opportunity to effectively resurrect them and bring them back to Twitter. And then the other third are users who have never been to Twitter before. Both are opportunities for us to create MAU and ultimately to create DAU, and that's one example that I'd like to point back to that helps bring the opportunity alive.
On time spent, the first way that we like to look at engagement is to look at DAU, if we were to look at one metric, that would be it. As you can tell, we're pleased by the progress that we're making. There definitely are other ways to look at it and we're pleased with the progress that we're making there too. But focusing on any one of them would probably give it too much importance relative to the others. Anthony, do you want to talk about ad load?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. Put the answer upfront, we do have more room in ad load, I would say globally and then also in the United States. But I'd also point out that we're really also focused on diversification. Earlier I said our return to growth was dependent on value execution and diversification, and diversification is not just into data and our self-serve advertising business. It's also into areas that do not rely on ad loads. So if you think about our video initiatives, many of those are driving consumption that are not necessarily dependent on ad load, given the way that that product works.
But we have been in a demand constrained environment, not a supply constrained environment. So, even without that diversification, we have an opportunity to sell a lot more supply, which is one of the reasons why we're executing against the opportunity of programmatic real time bidding.
In terms of pricing, I said earlier in the call, we don't like to look at pricing by itself as a driver of stability. We like to look at yield of the platform measured by effective CPM, and effective CPM for the last three quarters has been relatively stable, and we think the combination of CPE going down and click-through rate going up will allow it to continue to be stable.
I will tell you, that's a really powerful equation for advertisers, to be able to pay lower prices on a cost per engagement basis, on a like-for-like basis, and get better relevancy measure by click-through rate is really the combination we want to see.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great, thank you. And our next question comes from Twitter, it comes from the account of Francis Goose (40:47), who asks, beside live video and data licensing, can you talk more about other innovations in the pipeline that are designed to boost revenue?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure, there's a number of opportunities that we are looking at that involve consumption on the platform that were currently not monetized. And I just want to emphasize looking at, these are not around the corner, but they're being tested and considered.
A couple of quarters ago, it was in the media that we were testing the concept of a subscription product for TweetDeck. TweetDeck is a really valuable asset for us. It's really valuable for a distinct type of user. And the question that we're asking ourselves, is there a job to be done here that we can fulfill and create a business around it after fulfilling it, because we have to do that first. We have to deliver on what they want to hire us for first, and then, once we do that, we can create a business around it. And so TweetDeck is clearly being used and hired by communications experts, by the media and increasingly, by marketing experts.
And as Twitter has had a greater impact in the world, its relevancy and its use case can expand to beyond just the users that I mentioned. And in doing so, if we add more value, is that a way to charge from a subscription standpoint? It's very early. We've only done concept tests. We haven't really moved beyond that phase. I just give you that one example. The rest of the stuff I don't want to really highlight because it's really in ideation stage and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. But I know that was publicly talked about, so I feel comfortable telling you where we are in it.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. So I think we have time for just one last question. And that question comes from Youssef Squali at SunTrust. Youssef, please go ahead.
Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Okay, great. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. On the OpEx side both sales and marketing and R&D were down sequentially. Can you speak to basically the level of spend that you need to drive the growth in the business, particularly for 2018. Is this level of spend that we're seeing, what we just saw in Q3 enough to get you to where you need to get on the top line?
And then maybe a quick question for Jack. Any early read into the longer character limit on users engagement that you've been playing with over the last few months? Thanks.
Ned D. Segal - Twitter, Inc.
So Youssef, it's Ned, a couple things on the spend side. So we – and I alluded to this earlier in the call after a lot of hard decisions over the last couple of years and the expense base having come down a bunch, we're at the point where we will be selectively reinvesting and you'll see expenses selectively go up from here.
Expenses ought to actually go up in the fourth quarter and you probably noticed that head count or you will notice that head count went up in Q3. The timing of the hires is such that we didn't get a lot of expense from the new hires, but they obviously impact the P&L in Q4. We had better attrition in Q3 as well, and are seeing good trends both in sales and marketing and R&D and improved attrition and hiring some great people onto the team.
So in absolute dollars, those are going to move around from one period to another, especially sales and marketing because there is some spend that can get pushed a few days and can move from one quarter to the next. But directionally, those are both areas where we want to continue to invest because of the opportunities that we see in front of us and there are two of the drivers that will cause OpEx to increase on an absolute basis in Q4 as we selectively invest in the business.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And we're always looking for opportunities to make Twitter easier for everyone. And as we shared last month, we saw a bunch of patterns where people were abandoning tweets in certain languages, German for instance, because they could not fit their thoughts in 140 character constraints. So we want to make sure that we were rigorous about how we thought about expanding this and in answering the question once and for all.
One of the things we promised to do in that blog post a month ago, as we roll down and start testing is to be very open and share our data, and share what we find so that everyone understands what we're doing and why we're doing it. It's too early to tell right now, we're still watching and learning and observing how this impacts the service overall. I want to make sure that we are maintaining our sense of brevity, make sure that we are maintaining our sense of real time and showing what's happening in the world. But we want to make sure that we're also enabling more voices to speak and not be frustrated by the constraints. So they can actually get the thoughts out in real time and really share with the world what their thoughts on what's going on. So we look forward to sharing all of our data and what we find in the next few weeks.
Youssef Squali - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct and question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q2 earnings conference call. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; and COO and CFO, Anthony Noto. Ned Segal, our newly-announced CFO, officially starts in late August and will join us for our Q3 conference call.
We hope you've had a chance to read our shareholder letter published on our Investor Relations website this morning. Like last quarter, we'll begin with just a few prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During the Q&A we'll take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the #TWTR.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call such as our outlook for Q3 and the full year of 2017 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially.
The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our shareholder letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Good early morning from San Francisco. Thank you for taking the time to join us. As always, we welcome this opportunity to speak directly to you, our shareholders. You show us your faith in Twitter as an open platform for what's happening in the world and you drive us to do our best work. Profound thanks and gratitude to the people who use Twitter goes without saying, but I say it anyway. They inspire us every day.
Aside from a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in daily actives, growth in video and accelerating year-over-year growth in our data revenue, I want to briefly underscore five highlights from this quarter in the areas of focus, growth, product, safety and leadership. You may recognize some of these statements from my first earnings call back in 2015. I emphasize the connection only to illustrate how steadfast our team has been.
In 2015, we mentioned a need to better communicate our value. Twitter is what's happening in the world and what people are talking about. Twitter's value is in focus now more than ever with all functions aligned and marching to the same beat. In 2015, we said simplify our service to deliver Twitter's value faster. We have developed what we believe are simple, steady, and sustainable engines of growth, which brings me to my third point.
In 2015, we asserted a need to ensure a more disciplined execution. Our discipline in this regard is now robust. We're shipping products faster than ever and this empowers us to build features that can enable strong future growth. People are reporting significantly less abuse on Twitter today than they were six months ago. We take action on 10 times the abusive accounts daily compared to this time last year. Blocks after @mentions from people you don't follow are down 40%. Strong progress here but as always, there's more work to be done.
This quarter we brought in exceptional leadership. We introduced Bruce Falck, who heads our Revenue Products, we're proud to have Candi Castleberry-Singleton as our Head of Inclusion and Diversity; and Ned Segal will start as our new CFO, and we look forward to having him on our next call. Finally, often described as Twitter's soul, it makes me happy to have my co-founder Biz Stone, back at Twitter full time, already making a big impact.
With that, I'd like to open up the call to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. .
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. It looks like our first call or first question comes from Brian Fitzgerald at Jefferies. Brian, please go ahead.
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Thanks, guys. Live video growth continued with 22% growth I think in the number of unique viewers. What have you seen in terms of engagement from those viewers versus non-live video viewers? Are they more likely to engage with Twitter on a daily basis? And what do you think has been the biggest driver of growth there? Is it unique niche events that you broadcast? Better promotion? What do you think is driving that?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Brian. I think to answer your question, it's important to start off with why are we in live and how are we differentiated, and then drill down into the specific results that we've been able to achieve in the most recent quarter. For more than a decade, people have been on Twitter talking about events as they're live, whether they're live on television, they're just occurring in a local park, or it's a concert, and these conversations are happening across many, many different timelines.
Twitter is obviously the place where we want to continue to be the best at showing you what's happening in the world and what's being talked about, and we have to really improve on four things to do that. We need to be better at breaking news, we have to continue to have comprehensive selection, we want to drive more discussion and social interaction, and we want to personalize it. By taking the video and bringing it onto the platform that people are talking about and curating below that video a timeline of the best tweets that are occurring across hundreds of timelines into an experience that makes the individual feel like they're actually at that event is an incredibly powerful differentiator for us that delivers on what I just laid out.
From a strategic standpoint, we want to leverage nationally and globally recognized content to build awareness of underserved content that our passionate audiences care about. We're focused on sports, entertainment, news and politics, and e-sports. And we've been able to really ramp the live streaming capabilities to all four of those verticals reaching 1,200 hours of live premium video in the last quarter, and that's up from 600 hours in our first quarter in Q4 and that's across 625 events. And it has 55 million unique viewers. That's an increase of 22%. We are actually seeing evidence on a like-for-like basis when events are happening with the video on Twitter, with the curated timeline compared to the events happening without the video, without a curated timeline.
We have a deal with Live Nation that's a great example of that. When we had the video on Twitter and we curated a great timeline below that and the discussion is there so that the individuals feel like they're at the concert hall, the number of tweets increased 70% with the video on the curated timeline compared to not having the video. The number of authors increased 50% and the number of tweets seen increased 4.5 fold. We saw similar trends when we had Thursday Night Football and we didn't have Thursday Night Football in video on the platform. So we're really encouraged by the progress that we've made. We announced on May 1 that we're going to launch a significant amount of increased programming in the fall including our 24/7 sports network called Stadium, which we're currently testing with as well as our partnership with Bloomberg, which will be 24/7 global news network.
Ultimately, the value that we're going to drive is not just the head content or premium content, but it's serving these audiences that are incredibly passionate at Twitter combining the conversation below that video in areas where they're being underserved and driving real engagement. Some of our more recent programs have done very well in that regard including the WNBA. We signed deals with the Women's National Hockey League as well as Canadian Football League and so we'll continue to have this mix of globally national recognized content and then underserved content that we can deliver to passionate audiences on Twitter in a very differentiated way, so encouraged by those trends.
From an advertising perspective, we've got great momentum coming out of our Digital NewFronts on May 1. And we have advertisers committed to all the verticals that we are focused on. I'll highlight a couple for you. Within e-sports we have six sponsors including HP, Intel, Bud Light and Sony Pictures within entertainment, Wendy's has come on board after the BuzzFeed morning show in addition to Toyota that's come on board for that show as well as propagates what's happening. So we're really encouraged by both the content that we're delivering, the audience we're aggregating, the engagement as well as the advertising that is delivering unique value to our advertisers compared to other competitors.
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Got it. Thanks, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian at R.W. Baird. Colin, please go ahead.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks very much and good morning. Obviously good results with the efforts to drive engagement and daily usage. Wondering if there's a shift in focus at some point back towards the top of the funnel perhaps bringing in more occasional monthly users? And then on data licensing, given the acceleration there, I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on specifically which elements of the service you're gaining traction with customers and if there are any specific verticals or industries worth calling out. Thank you.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Colin. Let me put into context your question about audience, so it's framed relative to our results and what we're focused on. We couldn't be more pleased that our DAU growth, as Jack mentioned, of 12% was our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and I'd note the second highest growth quarter in more than eight quarters. The growth was broad based with double-digit growth increases for DAU in 5 of our top 10 markets as well as those markets outside of the top 10 also grew double-digits. Average monthly users as we reported were 328 million for the quarter. That was a 5% year-over-year increase compared to a 6% year-over-year increase in Q1, it was flat quarter-over-quarter.
The most important point that we would make is that product contributions that we're making for the platform are contributing to our audience growth in Q2 and we expect those product contributions to continue to contribute to our growth on a year-over-year basis in the future quarters. We'd note that positive contributions to MAU growth from product improvements in Q2 were offset by lower seasonal benefits and other factors resulting in the flat quarter-over-quarter trend. Obviously, our focus has been on daily active usage.
We believe we have content that's relevant to everyone in the world and it's relevant every day, and so we have elevated the importance of daily active users as a key driver of overall growth both from an audience standpoint, engagement standpoint and also from an advertising standpoint.
In terms of your second question, in the late fall, October-November time period, we took a look at all the growth opportunities we had for 2017 to make sure we had the right prioritization, and when we dug into the data business it became clear to us that this was a business that needed more structure from a productization standpoint as well as a channel standpoint. So we've developed a point of view on the product side where we want to have a land and expand strategy which gives us two opportunities for growth not just penetration but also pricing, and then as well, in addition to that, is a channel strategy focused on enterprise channel, the social channel, the marketing cloud channel, et cetera.
And what you're seeing in our results in the last two quarters is the accelerating year-over-year growth as a result of that change in strategy and more aggressive selling. We think this is a large opportunity for us. It's directly related to the audience growth and engagement on Twitter. We're taking that data and packaging it for our partners so as the audience grows, and the engagement grows, the value of the asset will grow. We're looking at developing new use cases for the data business outside of the current footprint of users and we're excited about the prospects. One thing that's really important to note is that one dollar in data revenue is equal to about $3 to $4 in advertising revenue given the difference in profitability. So not only does it help us on the top line, but it helps offset costs on the bottom line, which is one of the reasons we're able to achieve margins that are the highest that we've achieved since going public at 31% EBITDA margins similar to where we were in Q1.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Heath Terry at Goldman Sachs. Heath, please go ahead.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks. Anthony, the financial declines moderated this quarter. Should we be thinking that advertising revenue growth particularly on a per-user basis has sort of bottomed out here? Can you give us a bit of an update on where you are in the process of cleaning up the advertising offering and the TellApart shutdown?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. Thank you, Heath. As I mentioned, we're really excited about the third consecutive quarter of double-digit DAU growth at 12% year-over-year because that bodes really well for future revenue growth. We're also very pleased that we were able to see an inflection point in our total revenue growth improving from an 8% year-over-year decline in Q1 to a 5% year-over-year decline in Q2 and a 2% year-over-year decline when you exclude the contribution in both years from TellApart which as you mentioned were deemphasized and expect to be at zero revenue in the fourth quarter.
While we still have a lot of work to do for revenue growth to get it to track audience growth, the improvements in revenue growth reflect the progress executing against our top revenue-generating priorities in the second quarter as well as strengthening business fundamentals and I want to point out a couple of drivers that drove that inflection point. First and foremost, it's the second quarter of accelerating year-over-year growth in the data business. Second is continued strong growth in video with a very strong debut of the 2017 Digital Content NewFronts. Third is an improvement in our year-over-year growth rate for owned and operated revenue with a linear improvement in spending across our existing global and U.S. upfront advertisers in both May and June compared to April.
Our DR and social products performed better than expected while they were down year-over-year, we're able to stem that decline and see an inflection point in those products as well. And then just executing; our team has done a great job of communicating the incremental value that we're driving this year than a year ago to advertisers as a reflection of our audience growth, our improved ad relevancy measure by click through rate and our better pricing down more than 50% year-over-year.
In addition to that, while Bruce recently joined us, our team, on the Revenue Product & Engineering side. He's done a great job of driving platform benefits. I will note that one of the benefits that we saw throughout the quarter is a 10% increase in reach and ROI, based on new platform changes to buy on an interest basis and a demo basis. And so there's a lot of iteration going on underlying the product that's also helping us.
As it relates to the back half of the year we did note that while we're encouraged by the improvement of overall revenue trends, we don't expect to see revenue growth rates improve for the second half of 2017 because the headwinds you mentioned of $75 million. That's primarily tied to the TellApart business but there's some other comparables in there that are difficult and so the $75 million is a combination of the products we've deemphasized and some tougher comps as it relates to live, which we're encouraged we can continue to chip away, given the great slate that we have. So on a normalized basis, excluding that $75 million headwind, we could see an improvement in total revenue growth by fourth quarter.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks. And our next question comes from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of Michael Smith. And he asks; can we comment on the firm's talent strategy given the competitive environment and the recent 2017 departures?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you for the question, Michael. So we've been focusing a lot of our energy on making sure that we have some of the best leadership in the world, and we made a lot of progress over this past three months in bringing in a few folks. Really excited about Bruce, who joins us to lead our Revenue Product. He has been spending the past six weeks sitting down with the team, validating all of our plans and our strategy, and continuing to simplify and differentiate the product and really focus the team on ROI. And we're getting some – making some good progress there. Candi joined us as our VP of Inclusion and Diversity, and Ned is joining us on our next earnings call as our CFO and we're really excited about his principled, engaging and rigorous approach to the CFO role.
I spend the majority of my time on recruiting and we're looking for more engineering and product leadership throughout the company. One of the things that brings people to Twitter is our purpose, and being a place – the first place in the world to see what's going on and what's happening and what people are talking about. It's a strong purpose that people want to join and they also want to help with a company and a service that they feel is really critical and important for the world. So first and foremost, we look for purpose. We look for passion. And we look for great people who can help us focus and continue to help our discipline and help our execution and continue to drive the results that we've been seeing in the consumer product.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And the next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley at Deutsche Bank. Lloyd, please go ahead.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Wondering you're adding a lot of video content that seems pretty underserved as you guys note. Wondering how competitive those deals are in terms of just bidding versus other platforms or whether you think, in a lot of those cases, you're not really being competitive or there's not a lot of competition. And then, the partnership with Roku moving video content to larger screens, curious if you can talk about what you expect to see from that? And related to that, have you done work to understand how consumer perception is changing around Twitter kind of in general, but specifically around the video content? Are you seeing more people become aware of the content on Twitter?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Lloyd. As it relates to the video strategy and our differentiation, we think we have significant differentiation in the live video premium category given the uniqueness of Twitter. Twitter is what's happening, and our audience is coming, leaning forward, looking to see what's happening. It's an influential audience, it's an audience in discovery mode and it's an audience that's connected to each other. The biggest point I want to emphasize is the one I made upfront which is we're building live off of a position of strength. That position of strength is that people have been on the platform for more than a decade talking about these events already. All we're simply doing is taking all those tweets and bringing them together through our machine learning and putting it into a great timeline that gives them the best of that conversation with the companion video that goes along with it which should more conversation, faster distribution, and more discussion.
The greatest testament we have for our ability to compete in the marketplace while we may be smaller than others is we're renewing our deals. We've renewed the vast majority of our deals that we've anniversaried and the signs on the deals that we've already done and that need to be renewed are very positive. Getting to 1,200 hours of live streaming content up from 600 hours in our first quarter of Q4 is also a testament to the value proposition we can deliver. We've gone head to head with a number of our competitors with the same exact content streaming at the same exact time, and we've been able to beat our competitors whether it's in sports, whether it's in news and politics, whether it's in eSports because we have a different audience that's highly engaged with this content already and has an interest in it. And so that has helped us deliver.
Our advertising product is also very differentiated. We have mid-stream video ads as well as pre-roll ads. We're not just licensing live content. We're licensing the live content for all of the Twitter windows, in-progress, highlight windows, post events windows, and then on-demand windows and that's also differentiated. It allows us to put more of the content into the home timeline which is where people spend the majority of their time and create somewhat of a productivity loop across that live video that is the starting point for the windows that come after it, all contributing to the value for our advertising partners and of course our content owners that are trying to reach a younger, global audience that's hard to reach.
One of the points I'll give you anecdotally is that we've been able to deliver an audience for our content partners that's younger than their other forms of distribution and that has been incremental, but we recently did a study that actually showed not only do we drive incremental reach for our content partners, we're also doing it for our advertising partners. We did a study – couple of studies with Nielsen on total ad ratings and based on those studies we've been able to provide an average of a 6% incremental reach to television campaigns against targeted demographics. The incremental reach that skews toward the 18-year to 24-year olds is actually 25% relative to what they get on TV and that's an audience that hard to reach in that medium and so we're adding incremental value and reach for advertisers as well with a format that they're familiar with and comfortable with, which is their video content in advertising.
As it relates to your second question, our over-the-top strategy is much broader than Roku. We have a video app that's on Apple TV. We also are on Amazon Fire in addition to Microsoft Xbox and Roku is a new addition to that distribution. As we move to 24/7 programming in sports and news, we think those larger screens will be more accessible and more valuable to individuals as opposed to episodic content throughout the week, so we'll always be on. We want to be a dependable place for people to see what's happening in live and these over-the-top platforms will give a better viewing experience for that type of content.
We'll take the next question.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Ross, please go ahead.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Just one for Anthony and then one for Jack. So Anthony last quarter you said the linearity of your owned and operated ad revenue was kind of improving through the quarter. Just curious what the linearity looked like in 2Q and how you feel about owned and operated heading into the back half? Do you feel like the momentum is continuing to pick up? And then, Jack, Twitter Lite, the progressive web app launched in April and the app looks pretty awesome. What are your early takes and do you think this could be a big driver of user growth, MAU growth in international markets? Thank you.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
So on the owned and operated advertising revenue, I want to give you a perspective relative to what we said in the past so that we can illustrate the progress that we're making on the advertising side which we're really encouraged about. We have a lot more to do to get our revenue growth to mirror our user growth, but we feel like we're moving in the right direction. On the February earnings conference call we talked about global upfront advertising partner deals being signed. There was only five.
Now these are deals where advertisers negotiate with us for how much they're going to spend in that year and based on those – that level of spending they get certain benefits and value added, so getting those deals done is really important to give them a roadway and incentive to continue to increase their spending. We only had five in February, which is an indication that the outlook for forward commitments is relatively low. In April we gave you an update that we had 32 of those relationships. In the second quarter, what I would tell you today is that the linearity that we saw from those existing global and U.S.-based advertising upfront partners is that we saw a linear improvement from April into May into June, and that's helped the underlying growth rate in owned and operated having an inflection point from down 11% in Q1 to down to 9% in Q2.
It's also a testament that we're going out and really sharing with advertisers our improved value based on audience growth, based on improved click-through rates or relevancy, as well as pricing that's down more than 50%. I want to emphasize this is a relatively small component of our overall revenue, but it's an indication of when we are able to connect and engage with advertisers, we're able to show them the value and see the benefits in their spending, and that was really evident in May and June relative to the prior months.
I did mention already that our outlook for the fourth quarter and third quarter back half of this year will face a $75 million headwind. Without that we feel like we'll continue to make progress.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And, Ross, we've been working over the past few months on some really foundational work, and Twitter Lite represents one of these. One of our goals is to make sure Twitter is accessible to anyone in the world. And Twitter Lite exactly hits on this particular goal.
Especially in places like India, we found that our app was just way too slow to access. So we have areas in the world where network infrastructure is more costly, and we could be a lot better in terms of serving those markets and those countries.
So it's way too soon to assess the usage trends, but our initial results look really positive. But it speaks more broadly to a foundational approach we're taking to make sure that Twitter gets more and more accessible to people all over the world, independent of their device type or the network that they're on.
The other foundational move that we launched over the past few months is a redesign. And this redesign went across all of our services; the app on iOS, on Android and on the web. And typically, this would take the team months to complete, and we were able to do this in weeks. And we're really proud of that because it speaks to our ability now to execute across the entire service much, much faster.
The redesign was also really important because it clarifies a bunch of areas that new people were having trouble with or confused by, and it gives a lot of room for our team to move much faster and to build more cohesive end-to-end experiences. So we've laid some really good foundation down that allows more people to access Twitter, and we're really excited to see what people do with it.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. And the next question comes from Rich Greenfield at BTIG. Rich, please go ahead.
Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Anthony, or Jack and Anthony, could you go through I guess a better understanding, seasonality I guess just given where you are at, I think investors don't totally understand given the strong growth in DAU, what's the seasonality issue that's impacting you on the MAU front?
And then you also called out this, ""other factors"" what exactly is other factors? And you have seen this tremendous growth in DAUs for three straight quarters growing double digits. Is DAU versus MAU still 50% or less? I think everyone is just trying to understand how much runway does DAU have even if there isn't robust growth in MAU.
Can you still see double-digit growth in DAU for quarters, years? I guess just some way of framing how big that opportunity remains?
And then just lastly, I think Anthony you made a comment about the $75 million headwind in the back half. It sounded like when you mentioned the word live I assume some of that is NFL related? If there's any way you can just quantify how much of that is just not having NFL games year-over-year, that would be great? Thanks.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Rich. So on your question on seasonally, having sat in your seat and gotten similar questions from investors, the best way to sort of adjust for seasonality to see what the underlying trends is to look at a year-over-year growth as opposed to sequential growth rates. Both are important, without a doubt, but a year-over-year growth rate will give you a better sense for what the growth is without seasonality. And as we mentioned we grew 12% year-over-year in DAU, our third consecutive quarter, double-digit growth, and MAU grew 5%.
In terms of the factors sequentially, the majority of the MAU headwinds was in the U.S. We look at the funnel and try to understand those dynamics and what contributes to growth or the lack of growth. And the top of the funnel for the U.S. is up on a year-over-year basis, and that's important to note. It's also important to note that it's the second highest absolute amount in the U.S. MAU top-of-the-phone that we've in the last 18 months.
So it's a very strong outcome and result, only – down only in comparison versus Q1 which was obviously very strong as well. So second strongest top of the funnel on U.S. MAU that we've seen in the last 18 months. That said, the top of the funnel for U.S. MAUs did decrease quarter-over-quarter. We don't have a data that will explain a causal impact to that why the top of the funnel for U.S. MAU decreased, so it could be related to any number of exogenous factors including fewer events, lower seasonal benefits, or organic trends and so as we have dug into that, that's the conclusion that we've been able to draw based on the data and the analysis.
As it relates to the broader opportunity for DAU growth relative to MAU growth, the first point I'd make is DAUs actually equal MAUs that are activated plus new MAUs and so by definition it is dependent on your ultimate MAU growth. You asked the question of where we are in DAUs versus MAUs and we had provided a perspective back in 2014 and you asked specifically about less than 50%. What I'd say is our DAU/MAU ratio, regardless of how you measure it, hasn't changed meaningfully or substantially one way or the other over the last couple years. So there's still a significant amount of headroom for us to drive DAU growth without MAU growth.
I think the question that you're asking and we know we're going to hear from others is likely related to what is DAU growth from here going forward. We've had eight quarters of year-over-year growth. We've had accelerating growth through Q1 in each of those quarters and now we're at 12% growth year-over-year in Q2 versus 14% growth in Q1 and everyone is trying to figure out where do we go from here as we face tougher comparables. And so let me give you a little bit of perspective.
First, DAUs are measured as the average of all active users on our platform per day in the quarter while MAU is the average of MAU on the last day of each month. Therefore, DAU requires sustained changes over time to be able to move that average every day. We have much more visibility therefore in DAU with less visibility on MAU since MAU is the average of the last days of each month and DAU is the average of each day and we're almost done with one – our first months of the quarter. About 12 months to 18 months ago we did decide to prioritize DAU growth based on our analysis of what would help us drive future growth of the business, and as Jack mentioned, we're focused on delivering value for customers and advertisers on a daily basis, so we're pleased that we're able to see the growth in Q2 up 12% and it's the beginning of tougher comps. 12% was versus 5% a year ago.
As we enter Q3, the year-over-year growth rate in DAU last year in Q3 was 7% so the comps were even tougher. So we're really pleased that we're seeing stable year-over-year growth in DAU so far in Q3 despite the strong year-ago comps at 7% DAU growth. Now I want everyone to keep in mind and I went through the explanation of the difference between MAU and DAU because the growth rates could converge further given our priority on DAU and focus on driving daily usage, and so much room that's left in driving DAU growth relative to MAU growth.
As it relates to your last question on the NFL, what I'd say is the vast majority of the $75 million headwind is related to TellApart and other deemphasized products. We do have tougher comparable live advertising comps in the back half of the year. The NFL was part of that. We've talked about the fact that while we don't have Thursday Night Live Football on the platform, we do have live news and analysis and highlights of NFL programming throughout the season and we're going into the fourth quarter this year with 1,200 hours in this quarter and we'll add to that.
So we just posted 1,200 hours of live streaming. Last year in Q4 we only had 600 hours. We're going to have some 24-hour networks, so there's a great opportunity for us to chip away at that $75 million. We just want to be very clear, we're facing a much bigger headwind in the back half of the year than we faced in the first half of the year. So you can get to the underlying growth trends. Thank you for your question, Rich.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thanks. And we'll take our next question from Twitter, it comes from the account of Lyman Zerga and the question is, are you going to significantly reduce your reliance on stock-based compensation?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
We have made a commitment to improve our stock-based compensation as a percent of revenue from where it was at over 40% a couple years ago down to the level of our competitive peers in the high single digits as a percent of revenue to low double digits. We have made great progress in that regard. This is our second quarter of reporting results and we have improved our outlook for stock-based compensation decline on a year-over-year basis once again in our guidance. We still feel comfortable that we'll be able to achieve the objective over the next couple years in SPC as a percent of revenue and the progress we've made so far is quite significant.
If you dig into the numbers you'll see a sizable absolute increase as well as a relative increase as a percent of revenue. It is a commitment that we have to get there and we're doing it in three ways. One, we're anniversarying some initial grants from people prior to the IPO in 2014. Two, we're replacing some stock-based compensation with cash bonuses at year-end, and then three, obviously growing revenue will be a key driver of getting it down as a percent of revenue. So it's a focus.
And last point I'd make is we're committing to keep our net dilution in the low-single digits, and we've been able to do that since 2014.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thanks. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan. Doug, please go ahead.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. You guys talked about the very strong debut for video at the Digital Content NewFronts. I was just hoping you could give us some more color around some of your more recent discussions at Cannes a few weeks ago. Just given that linearity seems to be improving, is it fair to say that you have better visibility in the pipeline in the back half and into the holiday season? And what else are advertisers looking to see from you so you can regain your share of spend there? Thanks.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
So the thing I'd say about our progression with advertising conversations – I'll give you a comparison between CES and Cannes. Both events are where we spent a lot of time with the senior leadership of our advertising partners and the senior leadership of Twitter.
One thing is very clear from our partnerships. They absolutely support and understand and applaud our focus and differentiation on Twitter is the best at showing you what's happening and what people are talking about. They think that's honorable for Twitter. They think that's a very differentiated positioning than our competitive peers.
They also think that focus and clarity is important for them to understand, so they know why they should partner with Twitter as it relates to our overall audience growth and mission that we drive.
The second thing that's really important is that they understand now that the product changes that we're making is driving sustained growth, but wasn't the case 18 months ago. In addition to that, we've seen a significant increase in our average cost per engagement based on a number of factors. That's also increased significant value.
And then last, they understand the challenges that we have in the marketplace to make sure that we're delivering ROI in a measurable way every day. We can measure ROI with branding studies and marketing analysis, and our goal is to continue to drive a return analysis on a high frequent basis in a reliable way with third-party audits and third-party validation. So we're committed to that measurability and that transparency as well.
I will say that in January and February the conversations we were having alongside the upfront deals were about how do we get back to partnering in a bigger way, and walking them through all of that that I just mentioned.
Then we got the candid discussions about how can we do more together given how much we've improved over the last six months. I want to emphasize, these are meetings with 20 to 40 advertisers and agencies, not just thousands of advertisers. So we're chipping away at our most important advertising clients, and it's having an impact on our results. But it's still very early, and we're encouraged by the progress that we're making with the advertisers.
In terms of visibility, we talked about the fact that we only have 32 of these upfront deals, so we're still very much competing for end market dollars, and our visibility is about 30 days. So while we're encouraged by all the trends, we're still chipping away at getting incremental commitments on upfront dollars. The new front dollars are commitments that are in the back half of the year, and that has increased. But it's still very early (37:05).
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you for the color, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks. And our next question comes from Ron Josey at JMP Securities. Ron, please go ahead.
Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks. I wanted to talk a little more about engagement and just talk about the importance of the Explore tab. I know last quarter and even now we're talking about more and more how machine learning is driving engagement. So can you just talk more about the automated discovery on the Explore tab? And then a quick follow-up, Anthony, to your comment on the DAU growth metrics. Can you break out U.S. versus international DAU mix? Thank you.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yes. Thanks, Ron. So we've been investing pretty heavily in machine learning and deep learning throughout the product. We've been focusing most of our energy on the timeline and notifications, and the more relevant we make the timeline, the more we show relevant tweets to people, the more engaged they are. And that's both in likes and retweets and also replies and tweeting itself. So we've progressed in a pretty significant way along the timeline, along notifications.
Explore represents a new approach for us where we're organizing not around accounts but around topics, and topics that people are interested in as well. So within Explore, you find Moments, you find Search, you find Trends and you also find some of our live content as well. And more and more, you'll see more experiments around organizing Twitter in a topic-forward and interest-forward way, which allows us to experiment in terms of really getting to what people I think come to Twitter for, which is to follow their interests to follow their passions and to follow the debate and the conversation.
So it's a good way after you exhaust your timeline to find new things around what's happening in the world, whether it's topic based or location based or if it's a particular live event. So machine learning and deep learning is fueling both the timeline, notifications and everything that we do in the Explore tab and it just gets better and better every single day. The team has a really clear roadmap ahead for each.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
And then as it relates to DAU in the U.S. versus international, we don't break it out. I'd give you a couple additional data points. First, DAUs globally were up sequentially. Second, our U.S. DAU growth was very strong. I mentioned 5 of our top 10 markets grew double-digits. The U.S. did not grow double-digits, but it was very, very close to double-digits at 9% and it's continuing to see stable growth rates. What I'd say more broadly about DAU is that the DAU by country does generally track towards MAU, but not in every market, but in our top markets.
Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC

Thanks. And our next question comes from Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research. Brian, please go ahead.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious how you think the changes in privacy protection and GDPR in particular in the European Union might impact the business. You've obviously got logged-in user base which should be positive. On the other hand, maybe it constrains how data gets used for both the core Twitter platforms, the MoPub. Just curious about general thoughts on the impact?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
So the change you mentioned goes into effect next year. It's something that we're evaluating as you would imagine and we don't have anything to share at this time.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler at Wells Fargo. Peter, please go ahead.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple for Anthony on the video side. Your shareholder letter mentions the 55 million unique viewers, really nice growth there. Wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the trajectory of average viewing duration or total trend of hours, any additional data points there? And then one other on video would be, can you give us a sense to how you feel about content discoverability? Tons of video content on the platform right now, yet we have a sense that even some of your super users or power users might still not be aware of all the great video content on the platform. Thanks so much.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Peter. In terms of viewing duration, it depends on the content and it depends on the audience we're going after. It's literally very – I would say, there's a great amount of diversity and time spent. We've been overall very encouraged by the reach that we've been able to achieve in terms of our MRC unique viewers as well as duration and engagement and the data points I've given earlier in the day, earlier in the call I mean. So it's hard to give you an overall number because it's so different by vertical and it's so different by event. But overall, we're really pleased, and the best testament to that is we're able to renew our deals in the majority of the cases.
As it relates to content discovery, this has been something that we've taken a very much step-wise approach to. When we launched last year in September, we really wanted to nail the product quality, the video product quality in terms of fidelity and latency. The team did a phenomenal job with that. The praise that we get for the quality of video, the praise that we get for the overall experience is very evident in all of our notifications tags when we have events on. The team did a great job with that. From there, we started to spend more time on the timeline and curating it in a better way, in a more relevant way and creating some themed timelines.
As an example, when the President had a joint address of Congress and Senate, we had a timeline that was of just Senators and Congressmen and it was high quality, influential, important politicians providing a perspective on that address as it occurred. And now we're in the state where we're not just leveraging organic ways to drive discovery such as promoted tweets, such as search notifications, we now have a location within the application to find live events. And that's under the Explore tab. And that rolled out last night on iOS and rolled out previously on Android. And we're really looking forward to see how that performs, especially as we move into 24/7 in news and sports. There will be something always there for our audiences in specific geographies because of that transition. So it's been a gradual transition, and a bit more for us to comment in that regard.
The second thing I would really highlight is that when you look at Live and Explore tab, you're also going to see Periscopes and viewed VC content. And I want to emphasize the premium stuff is important. It builds awareness of live content in the platform. We're leveraging globally and nationally recognized stuff. But when I say that we want to build underserved audiences and underserved content, it's everything from the head to the tail, from stuff that's professionally produced like the WNBA to individually produced content. So it's a whole list of strategy with the goal of delivering to our passionate audience on Twitter what they want.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thanks. And I think we have time for just one last question and this question comes from Ben Schachter at Macquarie. Ben, please go ahead.
Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Thanks for taking the question. Anthony in the past you talked about experimenting more on revenue models and potentially going to subscriptions, micro transactions and even the potential to possibly outsource more of the long tail advertisers. Can you give us any updates on what's going on with that?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
We do think there's opportunities for us to continue to innovate and drive alternative revenue streams. It was broadly reported that we were doing a test on TweetDeck and whether or not a subscription product would be attractive for those premium heavy users. And also new segments of consumers. We're still doing work on that. We have nothing to report so early. From an advertising perspective, we're leaving no stone unturned. We want to make sure we're addressing the different channels of demand, the different pockets of supply and the different ways to buy.
So we're starting to tap into new advertising budgets. The Digital NewFront commitments that we're getting are really positive and they're coming from areas outside of digital media and that's really positive. And in some cases, they will be firm commitments. In terms of new sources of demand and new ways to buy, we have nothing to report, but we're testing and building innovative stuff that will ultimately prove to either be a benefit and we'll invest more in it or an iteration into other ideas. So it's still early days there, but we'll continue to make sure that we're looking at those additional growth drivers that we talked about in the past and hopefully we'll have something to share by the end of the year.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thanks. So with that, I'll just turn it back over to Jack for any closing remarks.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. And instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director-Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q1 earnings conference call. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; and COO and CFO, Anthony Noto. We hope you've had a chance to read our shareholder letter which was published on our Investor Relations website just a little while ago. Like last quarter, we'll begin with just a few prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During the Q&A, we'll take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the #TWTR.
We would also like to remind everyone that we'll be making forward-looking statements on this call such as our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2017 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. Also, the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our shareholder letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before we take questions, I want to quickly highlight a few things. First, we're really proud to report accelerating growth in daily active usage for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 14% year-over-year. Our goal is to build a service people love to use daily and we're seeing that growth in the numbers. Second, we committed to reducing abuse on Twitter and we've made significant progress. In the past two months alone, we've released a series of product features and machine learning models, and as a result, we are seeing a significant decrease in people experiencing abuse on Twitter as measured by reports and blogs. There's lots more to do, but we're on the right path.
Third, we continue to ship bigger improvements to Twitter and faster. We made it easier to follow conversations, created a new experience named Explore to make it easier to follow topics and interests, launched Twitter Lite to make Twitter accessible to more people around the world, published our developer roadmap with plans to unify all of our APIs, and we introduced new Direct Message APIs.
Fourth, while we continue to face revenue headwinds, we made progress refocusing our revenue products on our strengths and began talking with advertisers about the return on investment gains from our daily active usage growth and better pricing. We believe this continued focus should result in positive revenue growth over the long-term. And finally, we remain focused on making progress towards GAAP profitability. In Q1, we achieved our highest adjusted EBITDA margin to-date as we continue to create greater operating efficiencies. This past quarter has given us a lot of confidence in our focus and execution and excitement for our path ahead.
Thank you for the support along the way. And now back to Krista for questions.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Operator, we're ready to take questions, if you could go ahead and take a poll.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much. And it looks like our first question comes from Colin Sebastian at R.W. Baird. Colin, please go ahead.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. I guess, first off, curious which product improvements seemed to have contributed the most to the increase in daily usage? And more specifically, is there a way to segment the impact from live sports and other streaming content in bringing new users to the platform?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, Colin. Anthony Noto. Thank you for your question. Let me kick off with an overall perspective on the daily active user growth and then turn it over to Jack to specifically talk about the product. Audience growth in Q1 was driven primarily by organic growth, reflecting some seasonal strength followed by product improvements and marketing. Contributions to growth from product improvements importantly have been growing steadily for the last four quarters, and Jack will talk more about the drivers there in a second. There also is some evidence that we benefited from our new and resurrected users following more news and political accounts in Q1, particularly in the U.S. That's a really positive thing.
As you know, we believe Twitter is the best at showing what's happening in the world and what's being talked about. And having the political leaders of the world as well as news agencies participating in driving that is an important element to reinforcing what we're the best at. That said, our growth is broad based. We saw strong growth worldwide. DAU growth accelerated in seven of our top ten global markets, and the remaining markets in aggregate, they also accelerated. Let me turn it over to Jack to give you a perspective on the specific product impacts on DAU growth.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And as we have been talking about for a while now, we have been really focused on our core use case which, as Anthony said, is making sure that people go to Twitter and they see what's happening immediately. And the biggest change we made last year was changing the timeline to be more relevance-ranked instead of strictly reverse chronological, and focusing on the timeline continues to produce results. So by focusing on the timeline, we are displaying a broader set of tweets now from a person's network, and we're applying more deep learning models to make sure we're showing more relevant tweets first.
The other area we have been focusing a lot of our attention on is notifications and making them a whole lot more relevant. And, again, we've been using machine learning better to make sure that when people are outside of the app, that we're notifying them with something that really matters, bringing them back to the app and increasing engagement so they can get a better experience. So, this quarter actually marks products' largest contribution to growth to-date as well.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
And then, Colin, on the second part of your question as it relates to sports and other content, we're really encouraged by the success that we've had in our live premium content both in the product quality, the broadened selection, and the audience aggregation and monetization. In terms of content, we released in the shareholder letter that we had 800 hours of live streaming programming in Q1, up from 600 hours in Q2, and again that's across sports, e-sports, news, and entertainment. Our unique viewers of that content grew meaningfully over 30% sequentially to 45 million. When we measure the impact of different actions that we take on DAU growth or MAU growth, things fall in one of three buckets.
First, causality. We can measure causality in product improvements and the impact they have on DAU and in marketing through holdbacks and other A/B testing. We also use different analysis to understand correlation, and so one of the reasons why we can point to organic growth and seasonality is because the correlation is based on time series and the time of year. And the third bucket would be things that are not specifically correlated or identified. And so we cannot causally measure the impact of lives because it's available for everyone, it's not a holdback. But the evidence by show on an aggregate is really positive and something we will continue to invest in meaningfully to continue to drive more content, continue to drive bigger audiences for our content partners and, of course, deliver for our advertising partners.
Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler at Barclays. Ross, please go ahead.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. One for Anthony and one for Jack. Anthony, on the owned and operated ad revenue, the letter mentioned that the trajectory picked up from the February call to today. So, can you just talk about some of the changes that you're making? And are we back to flattish or even positive growth as we enter the second quarter? How should we think about owned and operated? And then, Jack, if you look at the product roadmap and what you just mentioned on some of the changes in the timeline, do you feel like this is something that can just kind of incrementally build upon itself and that the double-digit growth you're seeing today is kind of the new trend, or are some of these changes driving a pretty nice impact today but may not be sustainable long term? How do you think about kind of the overall trajectory of DAUs from here? Thank you.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Ross. So, the first thing I think that's really important to understand and something that we'll continue to benefit and talk about over the next several quarters is just the four consecutive quarters of DAU growth with an acceleration again this quarter to 14%. That's on a year-over-year basis. That's very positive and lays the groundwork for us to continue to go to our advertising partners and take them through the improved ROI story of Twitter, both because of the acceleration in audience growth and a significant decline in pricing by over 60% on a year-over-year basis, and that's broad based, not just due to mix shift.
The current revenue trends that we're reporting reflect budget decisions based on trends in audience and pricing of 6 months to 12 months ago when we were not seeing the significant acceleration in user growth or the more than 60% year-over-year decline in cost per engagement. The good news is we've been out aggressively telling the story of that improved ROI. Early feedback has been positive. In fact, we signed 32 additional upfront deals since our last earnings call. While these represent a small portion of our total expected revenue, we're seeing momentum in the number of upfront commitments signed.
That said, advertisers have long allocation processes that take 6 months to 12 months to turn around, so we have a lot of work left to do. As it relates to the trend in the quarter specifically, we did see an improvement in stabilization in the back half of the quarter. I would attribute that directly to the execution of our team going out and communicating the improved ROI story to advertisers, and that's best reflected in the significant improvement we saw in the number of deals that we've signed.
As we think about the outlook and we only give EBITDA and EBITDA guidance, but you can calculate a broad range of revenue, you'll see that range shows a similar trend to what we saw in Q1 with slight deterioration. Based on what we know today, we do not have visibility on revenue growth improving from the current trend in 2017. The factors that would impact that again would be the execution of us delivering a better ROI story. Two, on the negative side is we'll continue to face incremental headwinds in each quarter throughout the year from products that we de-emphasize or discontinued completely, and of course any success we may get from new revenue products or new channels of distribution – new channels of demand that we're working on, those have obviously low visibility until we launch them.
And then in terms of your question on the growth of DAU, let me tag team with Jack on this. We've said in the past that our growth in DAU is based on foundational changes that will continue to compound on top of themselves, and so we expect the changes that we make to continue to have an impact on new users, resurrected users that come back, and then of course our daily active users that will continue to have a higher and higher frequency. Let me flip it over to Jack to talk about some of the product changes we made in the quarter that we'll evaluate as we go into Q2 and beyond.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah, in terms of the roadmap ahead, so as I said earlier, the focus on the timeline and notifications is really important and really strong to our use case. So, we've seen for ten years that people go to Twitter first to see what's going on and to see what's happening and what people think about what's going on and what's happening. We want to get to a place where we're the first place they hear of something. Twitter is the first place they hear of something. And that means that we need to get really good at connecting all the dots and all the data that we have to make sure that we're building something that's really relevant so that when we notify someone, it's something that is deeply impactful to them, is relevant, and is important. And they go into an experience where they can dig even deeper and see what's really happening.
In addition to that, we're going to make sure that we're creating new experiences that bring together some new ideas. And the most notable recently is the Explore tab, which we launched on iOS. And this is organizing a new way of following topics and interests on Twitter by bringing together trends, moments, search, and the best of live video. So this is a way to very quickly see what's going on, but instead of organizing by the accounts you follow, by the topics and the interests that are happening right now. And we're seeing strong adoption and repeat usage here with 40% of Twitter daily active visiting the Explore tab and approximately 60% of those people coming back the next day.
Conversation is also really important part of the platform. We made a move recently to simplify the way people converse on the platform, making it easier for them to follow. Much more work to do here, but in our test of this new experience, we found that people engage more with conversations on Twitter as a result. So, we're really happy with that, and we're learning a bunch in terms of how to evolve the product going forward.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
And, Ross, the other thing I would just add as it relates to the product changes that Jack just talked about in our outlook is that we're not providing an outlook for MAU or DAU growth in Q2, but I would note that Q1 is typically our seasonally strongest quarter for MAU growth, and historically we have not benefited from seasonality in Q2, making the growth there more dependent on the product and marketing drivers that Jack just discussed.
Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thanks, guys. Super helpful.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald at Jefferies.
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Thanks, guys. Looking at your EBITDA beat, we saw good OpEx control, especially around R&D as a percentage of total to the lowest levels we've seen in a while. Where do you think head count and engineering is going to for the rest of the year? Is this level of R&D sustainable with your product pipeline? Thanks.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Brian. We were able to achieve record adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter despite the headwinds in revenue, and we'll continue to make sure that we drive efficiencies throughout the year in our cost base. We will have some incremental investments in Q2 in marketing and head count. We do have plans to increase our head count steadily throughout the year, and the major focus area is in engineering product and design. We will have selected key hires in other areas, but that is the number one focus for head count investment as it's the engine that fuels our growth.
But we'll remain very efficient and disciplined on our expense base, and balancing that investment versus growth and long-term favorable trends in the things that will be the greatest determinant of our value over the long-term, which is audience growth, audience engagement and then monetization.
Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research. Brian, please go ahead.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned 45 million unique viewers of live premium video, up 31% versus 4Q. How much of the user growth could be attributed to the live premium video streams? And maybe relatedly, how are you thinking about content costs as a percentage of revenue or on any other dimension going-forward given what sounds like a much more of an emphasis on aggregate and live video and premium video in particular on the platform?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks. Thank you, Brian. First, we couldn't be happier with the performance of our live streaming content strategy. The product quality gets great rave reviews. The advertising product itself is doing incredibly well with 95% completion rates and sound on in a familiar format for advertising partners, and it's differentiated unlike any of our competitors. It's not just mid-roll advertising but it's with premium content within context, so endemic advertisers can really participate in a unique way. And they're reaching younger audiences. 50% of our audience in live streaming is less than 25 years old and over 50% is international. So, it really is a great product for our audience on the platform as well as advertisers and of course content partners.
In terms of causality of driving MAU or DAU growth, as I mentioned before, we're not doing a holdback on live video and so we can't do an A/B test to measure causally what happened. I can tell you by individual event, we're really pleased and we're seeing great progress. As an example, we had the red carpet show for the Grammys. Music is a very big category, part of entertainment on Twitter. We set a record for any entertainment live streaming or sports live streaming that we have done since September at 5.1 million unique viewers of the red carpet for the Grammys.
And we think that's a testament to a couple things. First, we have 800 hours of live streaming product on the platform that starts to build habit and it starts to build ways to drive natural discovery. Second, we have a passionate audience about music. Some of the accounts that are the largest followed accounts are music accounts and global musicians. And then third, we're just getting better at being able to drive discovery and there's a long roadmap that will make that better and better every day. So by individual show in terms of audience, in terms of the demographics of the audience, in terms of advertising, we've been pleased across the board. And that has allowed us to be very happy with the overall results on audience revenue and costs.
As it relates to your specific question on the cost side of the equation, obviously we had 800 hours of live streaming content in this quarter and we had record margins and so our P&L captures the benefits of all of that investment including the cost. We're building on the back of a very successful initiative that our team started four years ago, which was highlights and clips in our Amplify program. And that business was built on the back of revenue splits and we've copied that same model in live. And in fact, most of the live deals we do also come with an ability to leverage Amplify type of content and so the two have become very synergistic and then help both in revenue and on the cost side of the equation. But so far we've been able to do the deals that are economically favorable to us and also to our content partners and deliver value for our advertisers, so we'll continue to go down this economic path structure that we have.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Twitter from the account of David Clinch. And he asks how do you plan to monetize user-generated content broadcast via Periscope and distributed on Twitter?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
So, two important points to make here. First, Periscopes that are captured through the Periscope app do get distributed on Twitter depending on the user settings. Second, the content that's on Periscope is wide ranging. It's from well-known brands and news organizations to individual people that are capturing live video content of things that are close to them or locally oriented. We can monetize that content with pre-roll advertising as we do with our other live video. We put that into the category of instream advertising. It's an important element of incremental content on our platform for live.
We've talked about our live strategy to be a function of leveraging nationally and globally recognized content to build awareness of under-served content. And what fits into that bucket of under-served content is passionate interest areas that may be niche across Twitter, but it's also content that is generated by users either on Twitter, through the Twitter Live compose feature or through Periscope. So, it's a nice complement to our overall live strategy and an important element of filling out the pyramid of high-end premium content all the way down to user generated content and the torso in between.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Greenfield at BTIG. Rich, please go ahead.
Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thanks. You're going into your first ever newfront/upfront presentation on Monday. Obviously, the DAU story bodes well heading into that. Could you comment on engagement? I mean, are you seeing the same type of double digit move in total time spent during engagement, however you kind of measure time spent on the platform? And then when you think about that presentation, like, what is the essential – could you just drill down what's the pitch to advertisers? And have you seen or can you talk to any new brands that have come on to the platform as they've seen the user growth over the past quarter? Anything you could speak to on that would be really helpful.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. Thank you, Rich. In terms of engagement, we have talked periodically about user active minutes in terms of the measure of time spent as well on tweet impressions. They are both up in the quarter. We're not sharing specifics on the UAM or impressions growth. We have provided that periodically in the past to give additional context when people have been asked or when there have been inflection points. We believe our most important engagement metric based on our product roadmap is driving daily activity and the measure of that is daily active users and obviously that's improved quite meaningfully back to mid-teens growth.
And we'll continue to give you updates from time to time if there are inflection points or controversy, but we're really pleased with the outcome that we've seen in those two measures. As it relates to the newfronts in our pitch to advertisers, we think we have a very unique pitch to advertisers. We think we're the best at driving brand perception and the reason why we think we're the best at driving brand perception is first and foremost Twitter is what's happening, what's being talked about and that's incredibly important.
Second, we have a platform of influencers. Third, our audience is in a discovery mode. And the combination of those three things allows our brand to be part of what's happening. And in our letter, we wrote about that very value proposition to advertisers and the fact that Wendy's was a great example of actually becoming what is happening and that's very unique. Advertisers obviously care more about just those value propositions, they care about audience size and they care about reach and they care about ROI. And the great story there is we have tremendous scale of reach of a demographic that's hard to reach, a younger demographic.
We also have people that are on-the-go on mobile and we have a global opportunity. The second component that's really important to them is can they reach their demographic within a venue that's representative of their brand. We have over 200 premium content relationships. We would challenge others to compete with us on the quality of our premium content video in pre-roll and mid-roll. We hand select these relationships and ensure that we're putting advertisers next to the brands that best represent what they stand for. And so that's another element of that.
When we do our upfronts on Monday, we'll announce a pretty broad slate, a number of new partners that reinforce that focus on premium content and ability for them to reach their audiences within context that best represents their brands. And then on the ROI front, I mean, I think it's math. When prices are down 60% year-over-year in the denominator, if you can hold the numerator constant, you have a significant improvement in ROI. While we think we're also improving the numerator because our audience has accelerated for four consecutive quarters, so we have a richer environment to target consumers for our advertisers. And so that's an important element to the advertising value proposition.
Last two elements I'll hit on is transparency. We are committed to transparency, media transparency, providing third party measurement and verification and you'll see very aggressive moves by us making investments in this area, and our goal is to be the gold standard and industry leader. We take that very, very importantly. The last element that I would hit on as we go into upfronts with advertisers is, of course, the ability for them to get a broad selection of content and so when we provide a point of view in the newfront, it will span the categories that I mentioned where there's the most activity on Twitter and that is sports, e-sports, news and entertainment.
And then we already have had great testimonials from advertisers like Anheuser-Busch and our ability to drive better ROI for them. They are a company that is in a very competitive category. They're in a business that doesn't have tremendous growth and so they use great scrutiny when they analyze our ROI, and we've seen improvements in CPM buying with them as well as pricing, and that's resulted in double- and triple-digit increases in ROI across six of the major brands that we recently tested with them. And we're going down that path advertiser-by-advertiser to improve the ROI either based on market and mix analysis or (25:44) studies, and this is a good example of some of the success we had more recently, quantitatively, in a very competitive category with a broad range of brands.
Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC
To the extent that you're actually very successful in making this pitch on Monday night, when do you actually start to see those revenues? Like I know for the TV upfront, it comes in starting in October, but for the newfronts and kind of what you're doing, how quickly could any of that actually convert into actual revenue and therefore profit for Twitter?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
I would say right now we're competing for the equivalent of the spot or scatter market budget allocation. As you know, that's a minority of the ad dollars that get allocated. Right now, sitting here today, we don't see an improvement in our growth rate in revenue, primarily for two factors. One, we will continue to face increasingly negative impacts from products that we have discontinued or lowered the investment in. One example is TellApart. We expect that to go to zero and that's a sizable business, and the negative impact increases each quarter throughout the year, in addition to some other product features that we've discontinued investment in and those will increasingly be negative throughout the year. So that is a headwind.
In terms of driving the ROI story and the incremental spending immediately, we'll continue to communicate to you in real-time how that's going. As I mentioned in the quarter, we saw stabilization after the earnings call in February, and we were able to get those 32 deals signed. And so we're moving in the right direction, but it just takes a while to move the mass of dollars that we have in revenue at over $2 billion.
Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Thanks.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon at BMO Capital Markets. Dan, please go ahead.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just step back from the business for a moment. Jack, could you talk a little bit about your experience in the dual CEO role? It's been a little bit of time now. I'd be interested to hear first, has it largely played out as expected? Are there opportunities, advantages that have emerged that you didn't expect? Challenges that have emerged that you didn't expect? But would love to hear that high-level view on how you're spending your time these days?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, I think the biggest focus for me is making sure that we have a really strong prioritization and that we understand what matters most. And I feel really confident about that at both companies. A lot of my time at Twitter is spent focused on making sure that we are really serving our core use case, and that core use case being showing what's happening in the world and what people think about it and what people are talking about. And we have teams who feel connected to the work and that we are operating in a great efficiency so that we can ship faster. And all of that we're showing. I'm really proud of our progress around abuse and safety, for instance, how quickly we met the challenge this year, and how we're seeing that meet in the results and the numbers as well.
The same is true for what we're doing around the timeline and notifications and getting better and better at delivering more relevant tweets to people faster. So, I feel confident that we have a good understanding of what we need to do, that we're focused only on what matters, that we're removing anything that may have been distracting, and the other focus for me is making sure that we have the right leadership team. And I get more and more confident every single day, not only in the folks that we have, but also the candidates that we're seeing for some of the roles that we're trying to fill. So, I feel really good about our progress and also the state of the company.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Great. Thanks.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ron Josey at JMP Securities. Ron, please go ahead.
Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Anthony and Jack, you mentioned in the letter simplifying the revenue product portfolio and that video remains the largest ad product. The Promoted Tweets and DR continue to decline. I think we're a quarter into the re-organization of the sales force. And so when you think about focusing on the highest revenue generating priorities, is that around video and the newfront/upfront, Anthony, per what you were talking about, or is it perhaps building back up your direct response promoted tweet ad formats? Thanks.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. We made meaningful progress in Q1 in what we define as our simplifying differentiator of revenue products. We discontinued investment in some products which I mentioned. We reallocated engineers across new revenue product areas as well as our ads platform team, and a number of new strategic areas that we hope to talk to you about over the coming quarters, and we hope they contribute to revenue growth in 2018 and beyond.
We did have some quick wins with the ad platform team reallocation driving higher ROI for advertisers and is delivering an incremental 12% increase in user engagement rates due to enhancements to ad relevancy for the new machine learning technology integrations that we have done. And then we've made some significant investments in brand safety, and we're committed to providing, as I mentioned, the best third party measurements.
So those will be the areas of investment that are important to make. In addition to that, we're leaving no stone unturned as it relates to possible areas for growth. So as an example, if we can better monetize our inventory through third party relationships, we will do that. We're currently testing MoPub buying on Twitter owned and operated at a small scale. We'll do tests with other third parties to see if we can improve the monetization of specific ad formats.
As it relates to your comments on performance advertising, it's really important to understand that there's some DR products that we have that are incredibly successful and sizable and we will continue to invest in those and innovate. There are some that we don't think are competitive and therefore don't have longevity to them. We'd rather reallocate those resources and double down on things that are uniquely Twitter and leverage our competitive advantages, like our social advertising products.
These are products that reflect organic actions on Twitter and we're simply providing an ability for an advertiser to amplify or promote that activity to a broader audience to drive more reach, and it's very unique to Twitter because it's only on Twitter. As you mentioned as it relates to video, instream advertising which is both pre-roll and mid-roll has proven to be our fastest growing vehicle and also something that is very effective for advertisers. One of the key reasons we drove such a meaningful increase in the ROI of Anheuser-Busch of double digits to triple digits across the six measured brands is because of the impact of instream advertising and how strong that product is. So we'll continue to invest in that.
And then there are some new products that we have put investments into that we'll evaluate. We would call these seed investments and as they grow, we'll able to share more with you. But to talk about the impact now would be premature.
Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC
Thank you. That's great.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan at UBS. Eric, please go ahead.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'll ask two that are sort of clarification on the shareholder letter. One for you Anthony. You called out on the revenue TellApart heading to zero as we move through the year, but you're obviously seeing improved results in the core O&O business. Can you give us any more sense of sort of the puts and takes as we move through this year? How people should frame some of those headwinds and tailwinds playing out as you sort of move through 2017 and maybe even think about it beyond as the audience kicks in?
And then on users. I don't know if this is for Jack or for Anthony, but you called out in the note that you've been identifying and removing accounts. I wanted to understand a little bit about those removal of accounts and what that might have impacted on the user growth, because we saw better user growth this quarter but were there impacts in there that would have made it better? Thank you.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. In terms of puts and takes question, Eric, the number one factor in 2017 that we think could impact our outlook is our ability to execute and make sure our advertising partners understand the significant improvement that we have in ROI because of the acceleration of audience and the more than 60% year-over-year decline in advertisers. We have over 100,000 advertisers and the thing that will impact our demand more than anything else is their confidence that when they advertise on Twitter, they achieve their objectives in both reach and return on investment. We think we have that formula, and then we're going advertiser and agency one at a time to improve the trend based on those proof points.
In a headwind standpoint, we will face increasingly negative impacts in Q2, Q3, and Q4 from discontinuing the TellApart as well as discontinuing investment in certain features and functions. It's also important to note that there are products that we invested in 2016 that we thought would meaningfully contribute in 2017 that we have pulled the investment from because we don't think they're going to be as successful as we had hoped and we'd rather put those resources against higher probability bets. There are new areas of demand that we're looking at outside of just targeting the digital and social budgets. Those two areas are premium display advertising and online video advertising.
Obviously we can attack online video advertising via our successful instream and mid-roll advertising. There are features and functionalities we need to provide for advertising buyers to do that at scale. We're investing in those. As it relates to premium display inventory, we think there's an opportunity to go after those budgets through different sources of demand on Twitter, and so we'll invest in those pipes and those technologies to see if that's a viable option for Twitter. And then beyond that, we're making investments in areas like data and ad technology.
Our data business was one of our fastest growing businesses this quarter. It's really high margin, the dollar revenue in data is worth $2 to $3 in other revenue and so is it has an impact on profitability as well. And we're focused on a specific channel strategy to drive revenue there. And then we're testing new sources of revenue from areas that have significant activity on Twitter already. There was news about a test that we're doing for TweetDeck. It has a very loyal audience. It's an audience of size. Is there an opportunity to deliver incremental value to all the TweetDeck users through different forms of monetization.
And then there are areas where we're not monetizing like syndication, like logged out, like Moments, and we're looking at different ways to monetize that as well. But I would emphasize more than anything the impact of all these things is not known today and the timing of them are not known today and they require great execution and iteration and that's what we're focused on and those are sort of the puts and takes in the quarter and beyond 2017.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And, Eric, I think you're referencing our progress on abuse. And our analysis has shown that only a small percent of the content on accounts on Twitter are abusive and we've seen no discernible impact on our metrics from these changes to make Twitter safer.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks so much.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Twitter from the account of Dr. AJ Kooda (36:40) and he asks what about live-streaming cricket or soccer to reach international audiences that are passionate about those topics.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
We would love to have both sports on Twitter. What we do is look at what the interests are of people on Twitter based on who they follow. There is a very passionate audience for cricket. Their rights are really expensive and they're locked up for multi-years. That doesn't mean we can't partner with different media companies that have those rights. Most of the deals that we do, do not exist. We go in and meet with media owners or content owners and understand what rights they have and then find a way to partner with them, not to just intermediate them, but to partner with them to increase their reach and the economics they can drive against the rights they have and it's a very differentiated value proposition.
So two areas that we're definitely focused on are international and international interests that are not similar to the United States. We showed that in Europe in the most recent quarter. We had Transfer Day which is a partnership with a major broadcaster that had rights to Premier League's Transfer Day. We also partnered with Deutsche Telekom in Germany to bring #StreetGigs onto our platform with a Depeche Mode concert that achieved great results as did Transfer Day both over millions of unique viewers. And then we did Six Nations Rugby in France and so we will continue to make investments in Europe in these different areas of interest.
In Japan, we did a high school baseball championship live-stream which is again a very passionate audience in Japan. And so the great thing about Twitter is we know your interests. We can serve those that are niche, we can serve those that are broad and we can do it in an economic way that creates value for our partners both on the content side and on the advertising side. So if someone wants to partner with us on cricket, we're all ears and we know the rights are up in India and we know they're multi-years and they're going to be hundreds of millions of dollars. We can add value to whatever partner wins.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from Heath Terry at Goldman Sachs. Heath, please go ahead.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Anthony, you touched on bringing third party measurement into the platform. And obviously there's been a lot of discussion around that and across every platform that's out there. Wondering if you could give us a sense of sort of where your ad technology is right now, your first party ad technology is, both in terms of measurement, as well as targeting versus what you would consider best-in-class?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Yes, what I'd say is we do implement the standards that advertisers and agencies want. So, for example, for viewability standards we have implemented MRC. We do think that's the standard for viewability and measurement within video. We will become MRC accredited. It's an important process that we're embracing. It's a long process and we've kicked that off already with the right resources. We have relationships with Moat. We have relationships with Nielsen. We have relationships with TAG [Trustworthy Accountability Group].
So we will be a gold standard in making sure that we integrate those measurement standards that our partners deem most appropriate so they know what they pay for. We want to make sure that the advertising that they deliver is seen by the audience, the audience reflects the demographics that they wanted, and they're getting a price that they think is what they're paying for. And we will make investments in those three areas and, hopefully, we'll be able to share with you over time more specifics on the things we're already providing.
I would say we're at parity with everyone else to a slight advantage because we do have some higher standard options as it relates to viewability versus others, but we're going to move very fast to get out in front and be the gold standard because it's something we can completely control, and something that we know our advertisers value, and there's no reason for us not to be out in front. It's not a function of scale. It's not a function of size of MAU or DAU. It's a commitment to our partners and we will develop products that deliver great ROI and measurement standards they can count on.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler at Wells Fargo Security. Peter, please go ahead.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for the questions. A couple if I could. First of all, Anthony could you tell us a little bit about small business. In the past you've mentioned it as a focus for development and I'm wondering if the focus on video products suggests that small business isn't as important to you going forward. And then secondly, on the account issue, I'm wondering if you could give us a little update on your efforts to eliminate fake accounts from the platform? Thanks very much.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. SMB business is actually very important to us. I would say we have three buckets of products that we're focused on, and they're equally important. So our social products are our bread and butter. Our social products are those things that are leveraging organic actions on Twitter and amplifying them in some way or promoting them in some way. Those are the products that appeal to SMBs. We need to develop a product market with small, medium businesses that take those products in a turnkey solution and in a pricing mechanism that allows them to be always on. And so our team is focused on that, and it's one of our potential growth drivers on the puts and takes list.
Will they use instream pre-roll advertising? I do think they will, but we think the foundational products for the SMB advertiser are those social products that are proven on Twitter. And then the third bucket is performance-related ads. And as I mentioned, we have some direct response advertising, specifically website clicks that is very large and very successful, as well as certain features and formats over mobile application download products that are also large and also successful, and we will continue to invest in that. So three buckets, social products around advertising, video products and then performance-based products.
For SMBs in particular, we want to build a foundation with the social products, continue to build success in the performance products, and over time trade them up to higher visual and broader formats such as video. And so we think we have a lot of runway on just the first two and the third one would be incremental as we build consistency and confidence in their ROI over time.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And, Peter, can you just clarify your question on fake accounts? Do you mean...
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Like nonhuman activity, Jack. Bot-driven accounts.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yes, so a few things here. First, we have for quite some time seen useful bots, and we recently made a move to help support some of that activity, mainly around customer service and support. We released a DMAPI to allow companies to create more efficiencies for themselves when they want to use Twitter for customer service. In regards to bots that are more targeted to spam, we regularly work to detect and shut these down, and we found that less than 5% of Twitter accounts are spam related. But we're always testing our tools and continuing to invest in machine learning and deep learning tools to make sure that we better address any spam vectors or any fake accounts in that sense.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Do you guys have a means to shut down the folks who sell accounts, like legal means? Because there are companies out there that sell followers right now.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
We do. Yes.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. We have time for just one more question. And for that, we'll go to Justin Post at Merrill Lynch. Justin, please go ahead.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Great. Thank you. I'll just ask a model question to wrap it up. Just on the revenue range, it's quite wide again, Anthony, and you were able to beat last quarter. Just maybe help us understand what gets you kind of to the lower end and the higher end of the implied revenue range? And then on the expense base, as you look at it from where it came in at Q1 just in total dollars both cost of sales and operating expense, how do you see that trending for the rest of the year? Thank you.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you for the question. So three buckets broadly defined will impact the ultimate outcome in revenue relative to the implied revenue range that you can get to based on our EBITDA and EBITDA margins. The first bucket is execution. When we gave an outlook on February 9 at our last earnings call, we similarly gave EBITDA and EBITDA margins, and it resulted in a similar wide range. What caused us to come in at above the middle point of that was execution. The ability to go out there and take the great proof points we have on improved ROI and convince advertisers of that, and get them to lean into their spending. So that's the first bucket, is execution. We think we have the information to deliver on that. It's a matter of time, and it's a matter of convincing them to reallocate budgets.
The second bucket is competition, and that's been relatively stable since February 9, and so our assumption is it stays relatively stable. And the third bucket is the negative impact from products that we've discontinued investment in or have discontinued or decided not to launch. And that is also a variable. And so things that would put us in the lower end of that range is a combination of worse than expected trends in any one of these three buckets or all three, and things that could put us at the higher end of the range.
We'd start with execution number one and then obviously if competitive factors decrease, which is always possible, there could be a trip up here or there, that's an opportunity. And then on the discontinued investment products, I don't expect there's going to be a lot of unexpected upside there given we've been very clear in communicating our desire to move away from those products. And generally advertisers move faster than you would want them as it relates to not spending, the opposite of getting them to spend more.
And then in terms of expense trends, we did give guidance overall that our expenses would be flat to down 5%. As a reminder, when we plan the year, we have planned our expense base for the year. There could be puts and takes in each quarter that make it come in below or above where we thought, and we're managing for the total year. And so while we had out-performance in Q1, it was driven by both upside in revenue and lower than expected cost through efficiencies. We will invest a little more in marketing and head count in Q2. We're not at target cost of revenue. It's something we're focused on, something we're incredibly proud of as a company as it relates to cost.
There's two factors. One, we set long-term ranges for our expenses as a percent of revenue as it relates to gross revenue. We'll actually net revenue excluding TAC for R&D, S&M and G&A. We're actually at the high end of those ranges now and obviously we have a significant opportunity to continue to increase scale and so those expense ratios can continue to improve. But for all three of them, this was the first quarter we hit the high end of that range that we previously communicated.
On cost of revenue, we're evaluating a number of different opportunities to continue to drive that lower. The most significant one will be revenue, because some of those costs are lumpy and are fixed. The second thing I'd say about costs that we're proud of is our stock-based compensation. We raised the improvement that we expect to see. We've previously said that SBC would be down 15% to 20%. We now expect it to be down 20% to 25%. If you average our net dilution 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014, based on our guidance for 2017, our net dilution averaged over that time is at 2% or less, which is really low, and in the target range of our competitors, and that's an important trend as well.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Okay. And that is all...
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Justin. That is all the time we have for today. Just to recap, our goal is to build a service people love to use every single day, and we're really proud of the audience growth we saw in the first quarter. While we continue to face revenue headwinds, we believe that executing on our plan and growing our audience should result in positive revenue growth over the long-term. We want to thank you all for your time and your support. Have a great day, and we'll see you on Twitter.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings conference call. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; and COO and CFO Anthony Noto.
We hope you've had a chance to read our shareholder letter which was published on our Investor Relations website just a little while ago. Like last quarter, we'll begin with just a few prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During the Q&A, we'll take questions asked via Twitter and additional questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the hashtag TWTR.
We'd also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call such as our outlook for Q1 and the full year 2017 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and recorded results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our shareholder letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. I want to start our call today by looking back. 2016 was a transformative year for us. Transformations are difficult, and this one was especially challenging. We started 2016 by resetting and focusing on why people use Twitter. It's the fastest way to see what's happening, and what everyone is talking about. We reset and refocused on our strengths, and we achieved one of the hardest things to do for a consumer services scale. We reversed and reaccelerated our usage. We're thrilled to report that daily active usage accelerated for the third quarter in a row, and we see that strong growth continuing.
We did this by making the experience a little better every single day. It may have felt like we weren't changing much this past year, but those hundreds of little changes added up to more predictable and sustained growth we will now use as a foundation to be more inventive and to take bigger risks. And that's exactly what we are now going to do.
We said on our last call that revenue growth will lag usage. As you see in our numbers and our outlook, this has proven to be the case. Our advertisers need the same approach we apply to our consumer service, reset and focus on our strengths. This means clearly differentiating and complementing Twitter's real-time nature, and proving to advertisers that Twitter is easy and works for them and their customers.
2016 challenge was reaccelerating our consumer usage. We did it, and that gives us the confidence we can do it again. 2017's challenge is simplifying and differentiating our revenue products. It will take time to show the results we all want to see, and we are moving forward aggressively. The whole world is watching Twitter. While we may not be meeting everyone's growth expectations, there's one thing that continues to grow and outpace our peers: Twitter's influence and impact.
You don't go a day without hearing about Twitter, how it is used as the fastest way to send a message to the world in an instant, how it carries some of the most important commentary and conversations, how it mobilize people into action. That's powerful, it's valuable, it's fundamental, and it's the reason we're all here fighting so hard for the service and company we love. It's been hard, it will continue to be hard, and it's all worth it. Twitter changed the way the world communicates. And we'll do it again.
And now back to Krista for questions.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. Karen, can you go ahead and poll for questions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And our first question comes from Brian Fitzgerald at Jefferies.
John Streppa - Jefferies LLC
Hey guys. John on for Brian. Thanks for taking my call. Just curious about the streamlined focus of the management team now, and how you guys are working to quickly iterate on the new product? How do you see the setup going into 2017, and kind of what are some of the product focuses that will be rolled out to simplify the user experience? Thanks.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Hey, John thanks for the question. So we spent a lot of our time in 2016 really focused on making sure that we have identified and clarified to the team and into our priorities what matters most in terms of the use case. So the use case that is fundamental to Twitter is being able to show what's happening immediately, being able to get people their news immediately, about anything that's new and noteworthy, and also to show all the commentary and conversations around it. So that led us to one of the most important areas, which is the home timeline, and making that more relevant, not just recent notifications, making those more relevant, so that we can tell people what's breaking, and what they should be, what they should direct their attention to, and easier onboarding and also easier ways to tweet.
We've done a lot of work across those four areas, and we're really excited that we're actually seeing that in the results as well. Something that we launched just recently was our Explore tab which is a different way of organizing information on Twitter based around topics. So we organized search, moments, trends and topics into one area that you could go to after you exhaust your timeline to find new things that are happening in the world and new topics that you might be interested in and ultimately want to follow.
So the majority of our effort will continue to be in the timeline and in notifications to make that simpler and easier for people to see what's happening, but also to participate and converse. But we're going to put a lot of attention into Explore, and making sure that we show more topics faster. This is also an area where we can show off our live streaming games, debates, elections, and events. So it's an easier place to find any time that there's something live going on at Twitter, and any topic that you might find or hear about in the world that you want to dive into on Twitter as well.
We're also using the foundation that we built in 2016, and all the growth that we are now seeing from that focus as an opportunity to take some bigger risks and to take some bigger bets within the consumer product as well, and nothing to announce today but we have some ideas that we are currently exploring.
John Streppa - Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks Jack.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks. And our next question comes from Heath Terry at Goldman Sachs. Heath, please go ahead.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great, thanks. Jack, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how notifications and efforts to drive engagement through push has impacted the acceleration in DAU growth. Obviously, there were a lot of topical things this quarter that drove engagement on its own, but if you have a sense of how much of that engagement growth was driven by those type of actions in Twitter that would be helpful, and potentially how sustainable you think that is?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Hey. Thanks, Heath. It's Anthony. The acceleration that we're seeing in daily active user growth for the third consecutive quarter is primarily driven by product changes and marketing. And within product, as Jack mentioned, the home timeline work as well as notifications have been big contributors to that, but there's been smaller contributions from a number of other iterations throughout the product.
As we said in the past, the changes that we're making and rapidly launching that are statistically positive in our testing, they compound on top of each other. And so, I don't want to overemphasize one area versus the other, but those two are larger contributors than the smaller, but effective other changes within the product itself.
As it relates to engagement, we look at two measures that we talk about in the shareholder letter. One is tweet impressions, the other is user active minutes or time spent within the service, and both are up double digits for the third quarter in a row. And that again reflects the combination of product changes as well as marketing changes.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
And our next question comes from Rich Greenfield at BTIG. Rich, please go ahead.
Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A couple. First, when you look at the double-digit growth in DAUs and time spent, you mentioned, has that continued into Q1? And where does DAU, MAU stand? And then the second point, Jack, I think you made a comment in your opening remarks about bigger bets as we move into 2017. What are you exactly talking about? Is there anything you can give us a sense of? Are you working on a longer form video product? What would be the strategic rationale there?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Rich. On your first question, as it relates to the DAU trend and engagement trend as we go into the first quarter, we were very pleased to see our third quarter of accelerating growth in daily active users and the double-digit growth in impressions. And we're also pleased to say that the trends do continue into the first quarter. We're seeing strong growth in the first quarter. Ultimately, the quarter's not over yet, and we have to do the analysis on the key drivers of the trends in the first quarter. But what I would say is the growth in the first quarter in DAUs remain strong.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And in terms of the bigger bets, we did make a big bet in live streaming and bringing that to the platform, and that was an entirely new experience that we were able to build in just three months. So we executed really well to create an experience that is consistent with how we've seen people use Twitter for the past 10 years, which is commenting and having conversation about a live event. What we did was make it a lot easier to see anywhere. So if you are on the train or commuting home or commuting to work or at the office, you can see the NFL game or you can see the debate anywhere you are. So we're looking at all the patterns that we've seen for the past 10 years on how people use Twitter and to create experiences around that that make it easier to share what's happening, to talk about what's happening and to see it much faster.
The other thing that we're investing a lot in is making sure that we apply machine learning more broadly around our entire experience. We recently hired Jan Peterson (12:00) to consolidate all of our science efforts, all of our deep learning, all of our machine learning and artificial intelligence, so that we can get a lot smarter and provide more magical experiences for people around showing them what's breaking in real time and giving them a sense of what's going on without having to do as much work as they currently have to do on the platform. So we're looking at a lot of opportunities to organize all the tweets around relevance but also around the topics and the interest and the passions that people care about. We have a really unique differentiator in Twitter, and that people come to us because of interest and build interest networks around that, and we think there's a lot of room for new experiences around that.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Rich, the only thing I would add to that is as we think about budgeting for live in 2017, which may be the question behind your question is, we're not focused on live form content, we're focused on all the use cases that Jack mentioned, but to specifically make it clear, we're not focused on changing our economic model for live, which is replicate the success that we've had in Amplify, and we're not focused on long form content. It's more what you have seen in the platform in sports, news, and entertainment and more globally.
Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC
And maybe if I could just follow up because I think it's something you both touched on. One of the things that we've been very critical of Twitter on over the last several years is that it's been more of a passive platform where people have just been kind of reading almost RSS like, and my sense is over the course of the last couple of months or last six months, that you've seen an improvement in people actually engaging, whether that's actually tweeting themselves or liking or retweeting. Have you seen any – is there anything you could talk to in terms of statistically, what you are actually seeing in terms of people, not just on the platform but actually engaging actively in the platform?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Rich, the best way to answer that question is the result of key metrics and that's tweet impressions and time spent. Double-digit growth in tweet impressions for three quarters in a row is impressive. I've said on the call, in prior calls that our tweet impressions totaled in the tens of billions. To move tweet impressions up 10% requires significant events, not just in one day, but across a 90-day period. And I think I've talked in the past about even on nights of the Presidential debates, we would have like a 10% lift in tweet impressions, and even if I assume all that lift is incremental, it only could translate into a 0.1% lift in impressions for the entire quarter.
So to get double-digit growth for an entire quarter in impressions for three quarters in a row, it takes a fundamental change and that's being driven by machine learning in the timeline. It's being driven by better notifications for more relevant content, and all the things that Jack talked about. The other measure that we look at because we do have a significant amount of video on the platform, and that continues to increase as user active minutes, and that also has been up double digits. So we're really encouraged by the outputs but the inputs are really the product changes that are driving those engagement trends.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
It seems like there's still a lot of opportunity to see even more as we make it easier and easier for people to tweet, and we focus a lot more on topics that people want to talk about and participate with.
Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC
So that just makes brand advertising that much more compelling as an opportunity for you as you move in even more so than a direct response?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
The majority of our revenue remains branded advertising. It's the area that we've had the most success. We've, obviously, evolved the formats within branded advertising into video. We're seeing really strong trends behind our video products, especially the Amplify product and the live product. They're very differentiated and they're more organic to the platform, so we'll continue to invest in those ad products that do just that and that does appeal to the branded advertiser.
Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC
Thanks, Rich.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente at Nomura. Anthony, please go ahead.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet
Thanks, Krista, and good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. In terms of why the acceleration in DAU growth, tweet impressions and time spent has not yet translated into monetization. I just want to make sure we all come away with a clear understanding of the reasons why that is. So you mentioned the shareholder letter escalating competition for digital ad spend, direct response declining, promoted tweets declining. Can you, Anthony, elaborate a little bit on those three or dimensionalize those factors for us? Where's the greatest pressure coming from? And then, if those factors are sort of fundamental factors or headwinds to you in terms of monetization, how much of it is those versus salesforce leadership transition, so fundamental factors versus organizational factors, as you have this kind of disruption or transition for your salesforce leadership? Thanks a lot.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. Let me answer the second question first and then I'll come back to your first question, and I'll focus it primarily on our outlook because I think that's where the bulk of the, where the focus will really be today. We've looked at a number of different ways at analyzing the business both from organizational impact as well as just fundamental trends, and one of the things that we looked at on the back of our reorganization to salesforce at the end of Q3 was the performance of those accounts that changed hands or consolidated versus the performance of those accounts from a spending standpoint that were not affected. And there was no difference in the trend. So there's no quantitative analysis that shows that we've had an organizational impact due to the restructuring. Obviously, maintaining consistency over time is really important, but that specific factor doesn't appear to have any impact on our revenue performance or on our outlook.
That said, similar to the fourth quarter, we provided an EBITDA range, an EBITDA margin range which gives an implied range of revenue that's quite wide and there's a number of changing factors in our business that result in that really wide range and why we'll continue to focus on EBITDA and EBITDA margin as opposed to a narrow range in revenue like we used to do. And the thing I would emphasize is that range really reflects a couple of things; we haven't been able to leverage the more attractive ROI potential of our audience acceleration and the double-digit growth in inventory and frankly, the significantly lower prices that we have now, and we haven't been able to do that yet.
We do believe that is a matter of when, not if. The budget allocations that are reflected in our guidance they really reflect our audience and pricing trends 6 to 12 months ago when we had no growth in audience or even a decline in audience, and the headlines really questioned our abilities to sustain our audience growth. Those long lead times caused the outlook to reflect 6 to 12 months ago, and the benefit that we're seeing today to be on the comps 6 to 12 months from now. So what are we doing to (18:50) the audience growth and the engagement growth, we're sitting down with branded advertisers and we're sharing with them the positive trends. We're taking them through the increased inventory, the higher scale, the greater growth, all of which we think can lead to better ROI and helping them run through their models, so that we can get better allocations over the next 6 to 12 months.
In addition to that trend it's important to understand that in the quarter we did see, in the quarter, the first quarter we did see an acceleration in the competitive environment for branded advertising since mid-January. And then the final point I'd make, which is somewhat tied to organizational decisions as opposed to execution or marketplace decisions, is that we are taking a step back and looking to simplify our product and putting our resources behind those products that we think have the greatest probability of success, that can deliver the best long-term growth potential, and that frankly leverage our competitive advantages in a unique way. That may cause us to deemphasize some products that are producing revenue in addition to decisions that we've already made as it relates to, when we talked about in the letter as it relates to TellApart.
So that's sort of the underlying trends that are impacting the guidance and your next question is likely going to be, what's in the guidance. So I'll just go ahead and answer that. The high end of that broad range, the high end of that broad range the growth rate, that's the growth rate that we saw in early January. So if you take the extreme ends of the implied revenue range, the high end of that growth rate would reflect what we saw in early January. The midpoint growth rate reflects what we're seeing now. And then the lower end reflects a more challenging competitive environment than we're seeing now and the potential for us to deemphasize some of our products that are revenue producing. So hopefully that gives you perspective on the marketplace factors that are impacting our outlook.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet
Okay. Thank you very much.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And the next question comes from Twitter, from the Twitter account of Neil Doshi, and he asks how did the engagement trends of live streaming football, how did it trend throughout Q4?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
So on live in particular what I'd say is the NFL was one important factor in the overall strategy. We're incredibly happy with the outcome of the Thursday night football programming. We're able to exceed the high end of our unique viewer expectations at 3.5 million unique viewers using the MRC definition, the standard. In addition to that we're able to learn a lot about how to really innovate on the product to drive discovery without a destination, to use organic mechanisms within the product, and most importantly, the quality of the product was our number one priority through the year. And we've received nothing but really high praise for the quality of the video in addition to the low latency.
We obviously want to build on that in 2017, and it's one part of our broader strategy to drive greater engagement of those that are already on our platform and to attract new users to the platforms. So we're very pleased with it.
As it relates to our partners, the NFL was really interested in reaching a new audience, and they're interested in reaching a younger audience and a non-U.S. audience and a more diverse gender split. We were able to accomplish that with them. We drove a significant amount of viewership from outside the United States. The percentage of the audience that was less than 25 years old was 50%, in addition to the fact that a majority of the people that consumed the product were not in front of televisions and they only consumed it on mobile applications. And so that was a really positive outcome.
And then finally for our partners CBS and NBC and our advertising partners, we're able to leverage our innovation on mid-roll advertising that used dynamic ad insertion to mobile devices, to over-the-top applications and to the desktop web, which is a great innovation and allowed us to deliver specific ads to specific individuals from specific advertisers all at the same time. Those ads had 95% completion rates with sound on which is very attractive for advertising partners and obviously can result in high CPMs.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And the next question comes from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Doug.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the advertising side. Anthony, can you just talk more about how you'll simplify and differentiate the ad products? And if you can talk to about reevaluating the product feature portfolio? And given all that, do you think you can grow revenue in 2017? Thanks.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
From a revenue product standpoint, I think it's important to really understand our evolution. The first products that we developed on the platform were really organic products. They were organic actions on Twitter that we then took to a promoted standpoint. Those products have been very successful.
We evolved those formats from those to video, and the video elements of our advertising business are doing very well, specifically the Amplify products as well as the live products that I mentioned, and we'll continue to invest in those products. We've also had success in some of our direct response products that have achieved significant scale, and we'll continue to invest in those.
In the shareholder letter we talked about some of the direct response products that are challenged. We're going to reevaluate whether we can be competitive in those products, or if we're better off reallocating those resources to products that are doing really well or new areas of innovation that are more organic and more unique and differentiated to Twitter and that drive really strong engagement. And so that's the philosophy. It's a disciplined approach, the same approach that we took to consumer in 2016 and one that we think will bear fruit over time.
In terms of lead time to getting back to revenue growth, as I said, the majority of our revenue is still branded advertising. They have very long lead times for allocating the majority of their budgets – not all of their budgets. We can still fight day-to-day for in-market budgets, but we really have to be in the process of being part of their marketing mix analysis that's done annually or biannually and making sure that we're using the new data and the better audience size and the better pricing to get greater allocation of their budgets. As I mentioned, they do that every 6 to 12 months. And so we started that process, but it's the very beginning.

Thanks. And the next question comes from Youssef Squali at Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Okay. Thanks, Krista. Good morning, everyone. So two quick questions. Anthony, I know you won't quantify the NFL deal, but just from a revenue standpoint, was it in line with your expectations? Did you guys actually end up making money on that deal? And will it be renewed? And second, Jack, considering the challenges ahead for Twitter in 2017 that you discussed, can you talk about the organizational structure at the higher level, senior executives? And any changes to your plan to continue to run both Twitter and Square? Thanks.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
On the NFL, it really exceeded our expectations on both revenue and profitability for both us and for our partners. It was part of a much broader strategy that allowed us to build on the back of that, so there's a direct value to the NFL and there's an indirect value to the NFL. We had 600 hours of live video content programming on the platform in Q4, and it was pretty diverse: about 50% in sports, about 40% in news and politics and 10% in live.
So there's both a direct benefit and indirect benefit. I think at the end of the day all of the reasons the NFL chose us as their partner, we delivered on and exceeded. As I mentioned earlier, the fact that we were able to deliver a younger audience, 50% younger than 25, 25% of the audience was international, 12% of the audience leveraged our non-logged in users. All those things rang true and we will look to partner with them in a bigger way. And I would note that the NFL relationship is not just about Thursday night football programming, we've had a four-year relationship with them on Amplify and we look to extend that relationship to things beyond just the regular-season.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And Youssef on the leadership team, so late last year we really flattened the organization, so that we could elevate engineering product and design, so they report directly to me, so I could be a lot closer to the products. Now that we spent a year really going through and making sure that we reset the foundation on what we're executing, what our priorities are and how we execute from an engineering perspective, we have a lot more confidence that we can move a lot faster on bigger things because we have taken care of a lot of the things that were just not simple enough, and a lot of the (27:25) that we needed to address immediately, so that we could develop much faster and bring new experiences to life.
I'm really confident in this team. Ed Ho is leading all of our consumer service. He's been with the company for over two years and he's shown a lot of great promise and he led a lot of our effort to make sure that we're focused on the right initiatives to actually reaccelerate our growth and has proven a lot to the company and also to his team. He's also been able to attract really senior product leads as well, Keith Coleman being the most recent, who also brought an amazing engineering team with him to lead the consumer products efforts. And then we've been consolidating organizations to build our strength, most notably in our machine learning and artificial intelligence efforts, which is critical to us being able to move much faster.
So Jan Peterson (28:25) joined and is now just doing the work to get everyone on the same page and make sure that we have a platform internally that every team can use to provide better and more magical experiences on Twitter through machine learning and artificial intelligence. And this focus and this team allows me and gives me a lot of confidence that I can continue to focus on the most meaningful things at both companies and we have the right prioritization in front of us.

Thanks, Jack.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And the next question comes from Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets. Mark, please go ahead.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thanks. Two questions. One for Jack, the acceleration in DAU growth is clear, it's impressive but I am surprised that we haven't seen a little bit more movement in the MAU, and I guess just given all the publicity around the President and his use of Twitter, what's your interpretation of what kind of impact that's having on overall usage? Do you think that's been negligible, negative, or positive?
And then Anthony I think you made a comment to the effect that you've seen greater competition for advertising in the middle of January, I think you said that. Is there any particular reason, any thought you have as to why at that particular moment you started to see that acceleration in competition? Thank you.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. Thank you. Mark. On your first question what I would say is that the President's use of Twitter has broadened the awareness of how the platform can be used and it shows the power of Twitter. When he tweets, it sparks conversation and discussion. So at a macro level discussion on the platform really helps us be the best at showing what's happening in the world and more discussions strengthens our key differentiators in comprehensive and fast.
From a quantitative perspective, what I'd say is each quarter we measure and analyze factors that drive causal growth in the audience not coincident growth. In the fourth quarter, the primary driver of our growth was, as I said earlier, product changes and marketing. We also look at a couple of other factors to see if there's any significant changes in those trendlines. So we're top of the funnel is one of those areas that could've benefited and we do not see a benefit to the top of the funnel from all of the activity throughout the election time period.
As it relates to impressions growth, which is another area we look at, as I mentioned earlier, the magnitude of the impressions of the platform is so large, it'd be very hard for an event or a single person to drive sustained growth in impressions growth. All of that said, having the world's leaders on our platform, talking about global issues, people being passionately expressing their points of view, that's all positive for Twitter, and that's what we're focused on. So any time that we can drive faster distribution of content, more comprehensive of content, more discussion, or more personalization, we're better at delivering what's happening in the world and what's being talked about. But we can't quantify any impact at this point in time but we'll continue to analyze it as we go through Q1 and talk to you at the end of the quarter.
As it relates to your second question, listen, the environment has definitely been more competitive throughout 2016 than 2015. On prior calls, we've talked about the fact that there are more large-scale players in digital advertising and social advertising budgets now than in prior years. That's only increased throughout 2016. In 2017, I think what we saw in mid-January, as it relates to acceleration of competitive factors, it's really when advertisers start to ramp up their spending coming out of the fourth quarter. February is a time period that historically has been up 35% to 40% versus January, and that ramp really starts in mid-January through February and that's when we saw more marketplace challenges in our ability to attract demand from advertisers.
I think there's a number of factors behind that. More players, more innovation, some of the competitors have a lot more at stake at this moment in time. The good news is revenue follows audience. We're seeing an acceleration in audience growth. We want to translate that into revenue dollars. That requires us proving ROI. We're in the process of doing that with our advertisers.
In addition to that, we're focused on other revenue streams that are not ad driven, and areas of low hanging opportunity where we have audiences that aren't being monetized. And the final point I'd make is what we're doing in video positions us to capture ad dollars that are not in this very competitive digital advertising bucket, and we've started to tap into those dollars through our live video product and we'll continue to invest in that area as well.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks. And the next question comes from Peter Stabler at Wells Fargo. Peter, please go ahead.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks. Two, if I could. Wondering if you could give us some DAU growth color by region. The numbers are looking good. They are improving. Can you compare and contrast U.S., Europe, rest of world. And then kind of more of a philosophical partnership question, in the early days of Twitter you worked aggressively to extend the tweet footprint through partnerships with media companies, and I guess from a perspective of distributing tweet content, and I'm just wondering in light of the election and Trump's use of Twitter, do you look back at that strategy and then just wonder if maybe that you provide a disincentive for users to actually explore the platform if they feel like they are consuming a lot of those tweet content through media partners instead. Thanks so much.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Peter. As it relates to daily active users and growth, globally we saw our third consecutive quarter of acceleration globally. I'd tell you that it's pretty diverse by geography. 8 of our top 10 markets saw faster growth rate in DAUs in Q4 2016 on a year-over-year basis than Q3 of 2016, including the United States. So that's 8 of our top 10 markets, so we're very pleased with that.
As it relates to your second question on partnerships, I would say the complete opposite. The fact that we have our tweets broadly distributed creates a competitive advantage for us. The fact that our tweets are publicly available creates a competitive advantage for us. It allows us to break news. It allows us to be the fastest and that's critically important.
The reason why we know that's the right strategy and the reason why we are confident in it is not just that it's the fastest and it allows us to break news, but when we look at the top of our funnel every day, we've said on the calls in the past that with millions of people that are new or resurrected, i.e. they are not currently a user in the last 30 days that comes to the top of our funnel every day, and that's a massive number that translates into over 400 million on a quarterly basis and 700 million on an annual basis that translate into actual users. If we saw a decline in the top of our funnel that was significant, your concern would start to concern us as well as other factors, but we have not seen that, and we think it's a competitive advantage and actually reinforces that top of the funnel dynamic that we benefit from and that still creates such a unique opportunity for us.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And the next question comes from Twitter, from the account of AE Hokes (35:34) and they ask why is it so hard to find live video shows like The Rally in College Sports? Will you be making a dedicated live tab on Twitter?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yes. We did focus a lot of our attention early on in building out live events and live premium video on the experience, as Anthony said earlier. Now our focus is making sure that we are connecting people faster with their interests and with the topics they care about, and that includes being able to watch an event directly on Twitter. So the Explore tab is one area that you'll be able to go to for any live event but we're also looking at other areas that gets you to that much faster if you express an interest in a debate, for instance, or in a game or in a new show or entertainment. So this is the focus of the team and something that we're going to make a lot of progress on this year.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post at Merrill Lynch. Justin, please go ahead.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. My first question is just on ad loads, and it seems like you're shrinking the ad loads. How do you feel about those right now? And is part of the revenue pressures cleaning up advertising that wasn't that effective on Twitter which helps the user experience? And the second question is just on video. You mentioned a ton of programming. I don't know how much it affected usage, but when you think about the revenue model or the profitability of advertising around video – and there might be a partner involved – how does that compare to the standard newsfeed ads? Thank you.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
In terms of ad load, we've talked about ad load in the past because we're actually growing our audience at accelerating rate and double digit impressions growth. That's our inventory. We've been able to take some pressure off ad load. The fourth quarter is a seasonally strongest quarter, and currently ad load is down from where we were in the fourth quarter. And as we continue to grow our audience and engagement faster than our overall revenue growth, we will continue to see some benefits there.
There are factors that could cause it to go the other way. If we saw an increased mix of DR on the platform, we would have pressure on ad loads. Similarly, if we saw an increased mix of video product, we would have alleviation of the ad load. And so mix is a really big factor in addition to seasonality, but the overall trend of faster audience growth and faster engagement growth than revenue bodes well for ad load absent mix changes.
As it relates to the video product, what I'd say is the unique thing about some of our video products is it provides two benefits. One obviously is we're getting content on the platform, and then second, we're getting revenue on top of that platform.
So our Amplify product was the first product that tied revenues specifically to content, and that model has worked really well for us. There is a revenue split involved, but the CPMs tied to those video products are relatively high. And the yield of them on an effective CPM basis is relatively high. So it's a very good product for us.
It also provides an opportunity to drive regular promoted tweet spending. So for example, if I have a highlight from a media partner and have the six second pre-roll, there's revenue tied to that tweet specifically. That partner could then promote that tweet the way it would a normal promoted tweet, and there's a secondary form of revenue that also drives more awareness of that content and more engagement.
And so we really want to find these products that have multiple benefits, not just revenue but also content, and then also driving virality on the platform and faster distribution. And so we think the video product that the team created in Amplify is a great product, and what we're doing in live mid-rolls complements that. And we've now moved into a product area where we have a marketplace where content owners can put the content into the marketplace and advertisers can pick that content and not only put an ad in front of it but promote it. And that's something we just launched in the fourth quarter in the United States and something that we'll roll out internationally in 2017.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And the next question comes from Dan Salmon at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead, Dan.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Could you speak a little bit about the sale of Fabric? And perhaps use that as an opportunity to just talk a little bit more about the type of products, the type of bets where you're taking focus away a little bit and focusing on the bigger bets? Thank you.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
As it relates to Fabric, 2016 we really took a hard look at our costs. We wanted to set a cost base that would provide us an opportunity to drive progress towards GAAP profitability. We have that cost base, and part of that decision process was really looking at what was core and critical for Twitter and reinforce the overall objective that we are driving.
Jack kicked off the call and talked about we know exactly who we are. We're the best at showing you what's happening in the world and what's being talked about. So things that don't directly impact are non-core, and those things that can provide an indirect impact to that are also things that we want to invest in.
The Fabric business unfortunately didn't fall into either of those two categories, and it was a large investment area to us. The team did a phenomenal job taking the acquisition of Crashlytics, and taking it from one SDK to an SDK of SDKs that was carried in two billion devices. Unfortunately, that just didn't provide value to us in our core activity that we're focused on, and so we made the tough decision to divest the asset.
We had a couple of priorities. Obviously the first was to maximize shareholder value. Secondarily we wanted to make sure that we did it in a way that really benefited the development community and kept a state of stability for them during that transition. Google turned out to be that partner that could provide both of those things in the best way. They showed a real commitment post transaction to the developer community, and that was a really important element in our decision on where the product went in addition to maximizing shareholder value. So it was a tough decision but one that we think is right for the long-term and that will be critical for us to having the right cost base on our path towards profitability.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
As Anthony said, we focused all of 2016 on making sure that we are really aligned around that one use case of showing what's happening before anyone else, being the best place to get your news and all the conversation and commentary that's going on in the world. So we made tough choices, not just with Fabric but also with things like Vine so that we could make sure that we're putting all of our effort behind Twitter and what has made Twitter great over the past 10 years and looking for new opportunities to extend that use case and extend that sense of what's happening and live video is a big focus of that as well. So everything that we're doing around live streaming premium video within the app and also with individual-created, live-streaming video in Periscope has been the majority of our focus and we wanted to cut everything that did not go against that and did not matter.
Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Great. Thanks, guys.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And we have time for just one last question and that question comes from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley. Brian, please go ahead.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Anthony and one for Jack. First, Anthony very good accelerating DAU and time spent trends, I'm just curious is there any way you can help us just to understand at a high-level, how many DAUs there are and how much time they're spending per day?
And there's one more follow-up, Anthony, you talked about potentially re-evaluating some of the DR products, is that embedded into guidance, or how should we think about expectations in guidance on DR?
And Jack, I guess, I'd be curious to hear what has surprised you most over the last year-plus as you've been CEO? And if you were to lay down at night and say, if I execute on X and Y in 2017, we'll be successful as a company, what is X and Y?
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you, Brian. As we think about DAUs and the other metrics that you mentioned, we re-evaluate what metrics we're going to share with you from a disclosure standpoint at the end of each year. We've obviously moved down the path of reporting more than just MAUs. We're now providing you with DAU growth as well as a growth trend in our engagement metrics. We think the growth rates are the thing that we're most comfortable with sharing at this time, and we're going to stick with that.
As it relates to the DR question, I want to make it really clear that our DR business has really kind of three characteristics, the first is, we have some products that have achieved success and significant levels of revenue, and we want to continue to invest in those and that's really important. We have some products that have achieved scale and revenue but that scale has been limited based on ROI calculations, as you know, direct response advertisers are very quantitative in their analysis, and if you're not delivering the right ROI, the spending gets cut off.
And as we've talked about on the calls in the past, we really need to improve our targeting capabilities, improve our measurement capabilities, and improve our creative capabilities to get some of our DR products to continue to scale the way our successful ones have, and that has been a process for the last two years and now is the time to take a step back and saying, is it too complicated, is it too resource intensive, would we get a better return from those resources, allocate the things that we have greater strength in or that are more differentiated.
And the third bucket which is not going to be obvious to everyone, is we've made some investment decisions in some DR products that have not come to market that have had significant resources allocated to them, that haven't gotten to the point that we could launch them, and we need to rethink about those resources and that level of investment and whether we should reallocate it. In terms of guidance, I kind of gave some color upfront, but what I'd say is, there's an implied range of revenue that's pretty wide, at the higher end of that it assumes there's no change in our portfolio of revenue products. At the midpoint, I would say there is some change but not as meaningful as the low point, the low point would require some meaningful changes in some of the products that are producing revenue and that's an evaluation process that we're going through.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And, Brian, I would say – I don't know if it's surprising but every single year the fact that Twitter just grows in its impact and influence and how instrumental it is in the global conversation, how essential it's become as one of the first places people go to, to get a sense of what people are thinking and what people are saying about any global event. It's a lot closer to home right now with a lot of this conversation happening around the U.S. election and the administration. And that's been amazing to see unfold and definitely been a learning moment for us. But I think the thing that constantly inspires me is just how important, how essential Twitter continues to become.
And as I look into 2017 and we look at what we can do, I just think the superpower we really provide the world is we can break news and get information to people faster than any other service in the world. And in order to do that, people have to do just a ton of work right now to dig through everything that may not matter to them to find something that really does. And that's why I am excited about really making sure that we apply artificial intelligence and machine learning in the right ways and that we really meet that superpower of being that little bird that told you something that you couldn't find anywhere else.
And that when you get into the application and when you get into the service, that it is as easy as looking out the window to see what's going on. And we have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of tabs. We have a lot of syntax that we still put in front of people and it should be as easy as just opening up your phone or the webpage and you instantly get a sense of what matters most, what people are thinking about it and how to contribute and how to participate. And I really believe in and confident that we can get this to something much simpler for everyone within this year and that excites me a lot. We've hit the 10-year mark. We're about to be 11 and this is a company that endures and lasts and thrives.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 earnings conference call. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; COO, Adam Bain; and CFO, Anthony Noto.
We hope you've had a chance to read our shareholder letter published on our Investor Relations website a little while ago. Like last quarter, we'll begin with just a few prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. During the Q&A, we'll take questions asked via Twitter and additional questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the hashtag TWTR.
We'd also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call such as our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2016 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and our quarter results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for discussion of the factors that may cause our results to differ materially. The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our shareholder letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Krista. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I talk about our results and strategy, I want to address the recent market speculation quickly by saying that our board is committed to maximizing long-term shareholder value. I don't plan to comment any further on this topic. We're seeing accelerating growth in our audience engagement metrics and we set a goal of driving towards GAAP profitability in 2017. Last year, we set out to do three things: increase our discipline, simplify our service, and explain what Twitter is and why people should use it. This strategy is working.
We hit an inflection point in Q2 and the positive trends are continuing. Product changes are driving an acceleration in year-over-year growth for daily active usage, tweet impressions and time spent for the second consecutive quarter. We're shipping rapidly and see a significant opportunity to increase growth as we continue to refine the core service. We're also taking important steps to make Twitter safer for everyone, with updates to share in the coming weeks.
Our live strategy is off to a great start. We launched a high quality experience, and our live events are delivering strong audience and engagement results. We've received very positive feedback from people using the service, advertisers, and partners, and we're getting more disciplined about how we invest in the business. We fully funded our most critical initiatives, and we set a goal of driving towards GAAP profitability in 2017 as we de-prioritize certain initiatives and simplify how we operate. As part of this, we decided to reduce the size of our organization by 9%, mostly concentrated in sales, partnerships, and marketing.
In conclusion, as our results show, our strategy is working. We're seeing accelerating growth in our key audience and engagement metrics, and we're taking the necessary steps to ensure Twitter is well-positioned for long-term growth as we go towards GAAP profitability in 2017.
And with that, let me hand it back over to Krista for questions.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Operator, we're ready to go ahead and poll for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Okay, great. It looks like our first question comes from Ross Sandler at Deutsche Bank. Ross, can you please go ahead?
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Thanks, guys. Jack, in the letter you mentioned that live video is driving solid engagement with light Twitter users, so can you just talk about the strategy there? Is the goal to bring on more premium content, like the NFL or Bloomberg TV? Or kind of balance that with UGC? And what is the conversion rate of these new folks who are getting the live video experience to regular Twitter users look like?
And then the second question, I guess for Anthony or for Adam, the owned and operated revenue growth was up 9%, and I think you guys said in the letter you're reducing the ad load again in the quarter. You're also seeing DAUs accelerate. So if we kind of look at 2017, is this the year where we'll start to see a reacceleration in owned and operated? And is 4Q likely to be the trough quarter for that line? Any color there would be great. Thanks guys.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
So, Ross, thanks for the question. I'll just let you know we're having a little bit of a hard time with some technical difficulties hearing the full part of – your full question. I think we understood the first part about NFL, so we'll go ahead and have Anthony answer that, and in the meantime, we'll try to fix the audio so that we can actually hear the latter part of your question. But we'll probably ask you to restate it.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Ross, and good morning, everyone. Our live initiative is off to a very promising start. Our number one objective when we launched in September behind the NFL and then all of the great programming that followed that was quality, and we couldn't be more pleased with the feedback on the live experience on Twitter. Our team did a great job building a product that can scale to many millions of users in three short months. In addition to building the product for our Twitter platforms, we also built it for a logged out experience on a number of our partners, including web syndication partners, Yahoo!, AOL, Sports Illustrated and SBNation, in addition to connect to TV partners Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.
Another significant technical accomplishment was that we developed and launched dynamic ad insertion. That's very important, given the auction dynamics of our overall advertising marketplace, to be able to deliver specific targeted ads to individual people, as opposed to everyone getting the same ad, and we've seen great response there as well.
All of that said, we're at the beginning of the beginning as it relates to our product enhancements, and we have a robust roadmap for easier discovery, more engagement and more conversation.
As it relates to the NFL in particular, we're very pleased with not only the quality of the product, the feedback that we've gotten from our audience, but also the metrics that we achieved. At the highest level, we had forecasted a range of 1 million to 3 million reach. As measured by unique viewers for all five games, we are over 2 million for those (7:38) first two games, and then over the high end of that range, over 3 million, for the last three games.
Additionally, as you referenced, we're very pleased to see the improvement in engagement with our light users compared to medium and heavy, having longer duration than medium and heavy when engaged with the game. Additionally, we're able to really leverage our logged out and syndication experience, with up to 15% of the audience being logged out and I think it's important to note that the player when it's syndicated or logged out it ultimately has the same ads as our own player on our platform and the same measurement. So we're monetizing that audience just as we are in our owned and operated platform.
And then the last thing we've talked about the fact that these live conversations, live connections and live commentary are already happening on Twitter by bringing the video forward or enhancing them and enhancing our ability to drive real-time distribution of the content and broaden that distribution.
So our engagement level for the NFL games were over 450 million tweeting presence during the broadcast window and that's up meaningfully from where we were without the video. But importantly, our live strategy is not just about the NFL. It's about leveraging nationally and globally recognized content like the NFL and the live debates to build awareness of underserved content and really deliver on the interest that people have on Twitter in small niche areas but also areas that today they cannot get access to content. So on the back of the NFL we did the – the debates live (9:03). They also had a very young audience with 70% of the audience less than 35 years old and we saw incredible reach over 3 million on the number of the debates.
We now launched our three Bloomberg market shows, politics and tech as well and in addition to that we've launched the college conferences, which is really the underserved content that we want to bring to the interest of the people on Twitter. And this week, we've launched The Starters from the NBA and we have a daily show called The Rally. So the strategy is coming together very nicely, the metrics are very positive. It's a great product for advertisers and we're at the beginning of the beginning with a lot more to follow (9:36) for the rest of the year as it relates to programming.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you, Anthony. So we're going to need to just pause for a second while we switch over to the secondary communications line. If everybody on the line can just hold for a minute, we'll be right back. So I think we're back on with the secondary line. Ross, could you please restate the second part of your question?
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yes, the second question. Does this sound better?
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah, I think you're coming through clearly. Go ahead.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Your owned and operated revenue was up 9% and reducing your ad book, while (10:30) are all accelerating. We look at 2017 would be stronger (10:41)
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Ross, I think the heart of your question is you're seeing an acceleration in daily active users, an acceleration in impressions growth and acceleration in time spent, when will that translate into revenue growth and how do we think about revenue growth in the future in addition to the fact that the auction dynamics are improving with ad load being down. What I'd say is we're not going to give an outlook for revenue growth for the fourth quarter and we can come back to that later in the conference call or for 2017. What I will say is that we're very encouraged by the product changes driving the acceleration in the last two quarters in audience and engagement. We believe those product changes will continue to contribute to growth in audience and engagement. They're not just one-time events.
And when you see accelerating growth in audience and then in inventory, typically you'll see an improvement in revenue because that normally bodes well for ROI. So let me flip over to Adam to talk about the benefits that we're seeing in audience and impressions growth and how we go to market and see that translate into faster revenue growth in the future.
Adam Bain - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah, hi, Ross. So as Anthony mentioned, marketers are looking for audience growth and audience engagements sustained over time. We've now had two quarters of that kind of growth and it's accelerating. That should help us greatly in our conversations that we're having with marketers. It's also really important to have great ad products as well. We've put out some ads products into the marketplace that are working in terms of some of the early response that we've seen from Madison Avenue. The video products in particular both the live streaming strategy that we have has been performing extremely well.
The packages sold very fast, for example, in the NFL deal (12:17) over the past quarter. We've had over a dozen high tier brands who have stepped up in the sponsorships of that package and marketers are happy with the performance. What's unique about that ad package or that ad offering ultimately is that it's a very valuable ad product. There's a sound on video ads in between high quality content and with completion rates now that are industry leading. So as we think about the path ahead for the live streaming strategy in Q4, we'll go out and bring our NBA, NHL and financial content package out to the marketplace. That's contents like Bloomberg and Shutter (13:00). And we're already seeing some of these packages begin to move in some of our early selling.
The other big ad product that we have started seeing some traction now in the marketplace is our OLV strategy to win online video budgets. As you recall, this OLV marketplace is about a $9 billion or $10 billion ad market with most of the money coming from video-centric services like YouTube and the like, and so we've seen another good quarter of ad product execution to win OLV budgets. So we're excited about the next quarter ad.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. So we will take the next question from Heath Terry at Goldman Sachs. Heath, please go ahead.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense about how you're thinking about user growth next year. Obviously, this was a year that benefited from political, Olympics, the addition of live. I realize you still have a lot in front of you for 2016, but to the extent that you would have investors think about the impact that, that had on this year and what it means for user growth next year, that would be helpful.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. So I think the first part of your question, Heath, is did the Olympics and the election drive your acceleration and metrics? So what I would say is no. The Olympics were obviously on air for 17 days and were talked about on Twitter, but there's less than 100,000 DAU over that 17-day time period using a seven-day average that we could attribute to the Olympics, so it's pretty small.
As it relates to the election, obviously, it generates a lot of conversation on Twitter. Politics and news generate conversations on Twitter every day. There's no noticeable impact that we've seen from the elections. I would note that we saw an acceleration in Q2 in our metrics as well as Q3 where there's a lot less election activity. I would note that in the third quarter we did benefit meaningfully on the particular days that we had the live debates in the integrated product of that curated timeline of the conversations and commentary that are happening around the debates on those days. We did have record DAUs on a couple of days which is a great accomplishment. But the massive size of our DAUs and the fact that we average them over 90 days, we really need to have a debate every day on Twitter for it to meaningfully improve the metrics on a quarterly basis and that's where we're headed. We want to really leverage this nationally and globally recognized content on live to build awareness of underserved so that we do have a dependable place to find live content. So we're very encouraged by those events, but for them to have an impact over a 90-day period our live strategy has to be more fully rolled out. And we're on the process of doing that.
And so the product changes were the key drivers. The product changes to the core Twitter application were the key drivers for their growth and the acceleration of DAUs as well as impressions and the time spent. As we look forward, we'll give you perspectives as we report, but we're not going to be in the business of forecasting growth other than to say we're encouraged by the product changes. We think they'll impact more than one quarter given the fact that they are changes that affect all of the users that are currently on the platform and those that come every day.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Well, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering could you talk a little bit about churn metrics and how that might have been trending during the quarter. And maybe separately, regarding advertising spend or spending per advertiser, I was wondering if you could talk about some of the dynamics going on there. I know you provide some commentary around customers using DCM, so I'm certainly also wondering to what degree that customers who are using DCM might be having – expressing different spending trends versus other customers? Thank you.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. As it relates to our monthly active user growth, which is what we typically refer to when we talk about retention, et cetera, we've seen growth in monthly active users from both strong top of the fall contribution as well as retention contributing. So both are contributing in the quarter.
From our perspective – we've talked about on the call in the past that we are seeing a mix shift from big large branded advertisers, which have a lot higher spending per advertiser than SMB advertisers that have much smaller, and as our mix shift has gone from that large advertisers to the smaller advertisers, there has been pressure on ARPU. Within each individual channel, there are different trends in that, but that's the overall trend as it relates to ARPU and your specific question. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we did see an improvement despite that trend, in ARPU.
Adam Bain - Twitter, Inc.
And, Brian, I can take your DCM question. So the DCM work is starting to take shape. As we mentioned in the letter, we're seeing $75 million now annual run rate of ads that are being tracked and reported through DCM. In Q4, we've already moved to a public beta for all the brand engagement objectives, and we're going to continue our private beta for direct response customers and performance-based marketers who can use the desktop data as a proxy for all the mobile conversions. Obviously, DCM is an important step for us, as we're helping marketers better understand how Twitter ads are impacting their own conversion rates, and also the net effect of cross-device conversions overall.
The other part of our DoubleClick deal is DBM, the buying part, and so as we mentioned in the letter, we've already started our alpha of DoubleClick Bid Manager the first few weeks into Q4. So we have a live campaign from advertisers who are buying Twitter through DBM.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Okay, great. But any – specifically you can offer in terms of growth in spending from those customers who are using products (19:17) versus those who are not?
Adam Bain - Twitter, Inc.
So it's really early days overall. We're encouraged by what we've seen so far in terms of the track spend and which way that's headed but again, it's still at a beta.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Okay. Thank you very much.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And the next question comes from Eric Sheridan at UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two. For Anthony, the commentary in the letter about refocusing around certain initiatives, wanted to know if we can get a little more granularity or color there about where investments might be going up, where you might be pulling back in certain areas around the business. So also the follow-up would be, so we can get a little bit better sense of what that might mean for the cost structure of the business as you move out of 2016 into 2017. Thanks so much.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. First, I think it's really important for everyone to understand, we are focused on driving towards GAAP profitability in 2017. We are cutting costs that are non-core to our key objectives of driving audience engagement and monetization growth. It's also, I think, critical to understand that we're fully funding our most important initiatives that are driving those metrics and that are doing that today. As it relates to the broader objective, once a company gets to our scale and growth, it's appropriate to drive long-term margins and GAAP profitability. We're very proud of the fact that we've already generated over $330 million of free cash flow in 2016, and that's defined as operating cash flow less CapEx.
And while that's an important milestone to achieve for investor appeal, we think GAAP profitability is also an important milestone to achieve for investor appeal, and we're focused on increasing the value for our investors and future investors.
As it relates to what it means to the cost structure leaving 2017, first, I think I would point out that the financial impact of restructuring in 2016 will be small. The bulk of the cost savings will be in 2017. We've talked to you in the past about our long-term adjusted EBITDA margins as a percent of net revenue being 40% to 45%. We remain confident in that objective, and I want to give you a quick snapshot of where we are today and how that will change as we go into 2017.
So in the most recent quarter, Q3 2016, our G&A expenses on a net revenue basis were 7.6% of net revenue. So that's revenue ex-tax, 7.6%. Our target that we've shared with you in the past is 7% to 9%. So we're already at the low end of the G&A expenses and quite favorably to our competitive peers, many of which that have magnitudes greater in revenue.
On research and development, it's a core investment area of the company. We expect that line to continue to grow with revenue. It's the engine of growth, our engineering part design team is critical to driving the product changes that are resulting in audience engagement and audience metrics increasing. That was 15.4% of revenue on an ex-tax basis and our long-term targets of 11% to 15%. Any changes that you see in that line are going to be from non-core areas as we move forward and we'll keep funding the most important areas.
Sales and marketing, as we mentioned in our letter, was the largest area impacted by the restructuring that we announced. That was 30.7% of revenue ex-tax and our goal is to be 22% to 26% and we have a path to get there on the back of these changes and other initiatives as we move over time. And then last, cost of revenue was 29.6% of revenue ex-tax and our goal is to be 19% to 23% there and we're aggressively pursuing and evaluating a host of different options both in our owned and operated data centers as well as partnerships with others. We've utilized third party cloud computing. It's been very efficient for us. We'll continue to look at those options to have that line item improve as well. So we have a framework that we've talked about in the past. Today, we'll make a meaningful change towards that, but the overall team's goal of driving towards GAAP profitability in 2017 will bring it to fruition.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for the color, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks. And we will take the next question from Twitter. It comes from the account of Victor Anthony at Axiom Capital, and he asks, which product improvements led to the positive impact on revenue growth, engagement and monetization?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Anthony. So a lot of the improvements have been really focused in two areas: one, notifications; and two, the home timeline. So the home timeline is where people spend the majority of their time on Twitter, and we made a change earlier in the year to make sure that we're not just sorting by recency but also by relevance. So we're showing the most important tweets and the tweets that you really need to see faster and higher up in your timeline.
The other aspect is notifications. So we're getting more and more relevant about delivering our notifications, and we're delivering people to an experience and to tweets that are not dead ends, but they can actually explore more of Twitter.
So those two areas have benefited dramatically from applying a whole lot more machine learning to each, and the other two areas that we continue to apply machine learning to are on-boarding and also tweeting. And we expect to continue to drive those accelerations in DAU, in tweet impressions and time spent by focusing on those four areas and applying more technology to the problem.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And the next question comes from Anthony DiClemente at Nomura.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions, and good morning. Anthony, you gave us the metrics on NFL viewership, but can you quantify how much live video contributed in the quarter in terms of revenue, please? Really just trying to understand if your live video streaming events in Q4 is what's driving the big implied revenue decline in Q4 versus Q3.
And then on DAUs, you gave us the growth rate, but can you give us the number of DAUs in the quarter? That would be great. And then any guidance on MAUs or DAUs for next quarter would also be great, even just directionally. Will they be up?
And then for Jack, bigger picture – I just heard what you said about the incremental improvements. What is the product roadmap from here going forward other than live video? I just wonder, are there any plans for big revolutionary product changes? If it's really just live video and live streaming, I also wonder the environment's more competitive for premium content. Won't you have to spend more on sports rights acquisition and premium video rights in order to keep this going? Thank you very much.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. Thank you, Anthony. It terms of live revenue in the quarter, we had two NFL games in the quarter in Q3, so it's 20% of the overall package that we have. And so there was some revenue contribution, but it was small relative to the total revenue. And we launched the rest of our programming schedule on the back of that with much more of that being launched and monetized in Q4. I will tell you and I alluded to previously, we're obviously very pleased with the response that we've had from advertisers on live advertising, but it also benefits everything else that we do in advertising because part of overall package that we're bringing to bear with advertisers. And so we do bundled packages, amplify and other types of packaged sales.
In terms of fourth quarter revenue, we did not give revenue guidance. You referenced a guidance that was not reflective of what we said. I think it's important to understand we did give EBITDA guidance on a 2016 basis as well as adjusted EBITDA margins. And the reason why we did not give a revenue forecast really ties back to the changes we announced today in our sales force. We're restructuring and moving from three channels to two channels. There will be transitions of account that will take place over the course of the quarter. Adam and the team think this is the right thing for the long-term business to drive both efficiency and ability to scale effectively. Sales force transitions can have unexpected impacts when you're transitioning accounts which is what we've seen from other Internet companies. And so given the transition of accounts, the revenue range for the fourth quarter is much wider than we'd normally be looking at, and so we're not going to give a specific narrow guidance range.
But I would say that the trends that we're seeing in audience acceleration as well as engagement acceleration, impressions in particular, generally bode well for better ROI and for long-term future revenue growth. And so that's a one quarter focus, which is why we're not providing guidance.
Your question on DAU, we'll evaluate our disclosure practices at the end of the year as we've done in the last two years. At the moment, we're not going to give you specific DAU numbers. We are giving you the percent growth as we do for ad engagements as well as CPE. We think that's very helpful and incremental to what we've done in the past and I think more longer term changes we'll announce at the – in February when we announce fourth quarter results in 2016 results going into 2017.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
And, Anthony, we're focused on building the most useful open and comprehensive news network on the planet and this is the faster way to see what's happening and our product is already revolutionary and we're focused on improving it every single day. We've been making hundreds of small changes as quickly as we can that will continue to compound and more usage and the people are showing us that these changes are working. We're seeing more people wanting to use Twitter and to use it more often. So we're focused on the most the areas of the product that people spend the majority of their time in which is a home timeline and notifications, making sure that the home timeline becomes more and more relevant. You open up Twitter and you see exactly what's happening.
And when you're out of the app, we're sending you notifications about what you may have missed or what you need to see. The more time we spend on on-boarding and making Twitter – tweeting better and enabling people to better capture what's happening, the better the services gets. So we're certainly looking at everything that we can do to improve our core and to strengthen our core because we think it's unique and we think it's powerful in the world. We're also looking at new opportunities like LIFE because this is a pattern of usage that we've seen for 10 years on the platform. We've seen people watch TV with Twitter for 10 years and comment about it which makes whatever they're watching a lot more interesting, a lot more entertaining and a lot more insightful. And we're looking at that and trying to remove friction in every way that we can. And that's what the live streaming initiative is about. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to remove more friction and deliver more value to the people using our service.
Adam Bain - Twitter, Inc.
And, Anthony, because we get that question a lot, we want to really emphasize that we think there's a significant opportunity to drive daily usage growth and engagement growth through the refined core initiative. And so in the letter, we quantified that there are millions of users that come every day to Twitter that are either signing up for new account or reactivating account, and the opportunity to leverage those millions that come at top of our funnel has been fairly consistent over the last year. And we have that opportunity to convert them into daily active users. And I know many of you will likely look at that number and try to multiply it by 365 to figure out what the absolute TAM is.
Just for your benefit, we look at it not just on a daily basis in the top of the funnel which is very large, millions come every day. But we also look at on a monthly basis which we reported 317 million active unique accounts on a monthly basis. If you look at that same measurement on a quarterly basis, it's 420 million unique active accounts on a quarterly basis and if you look on an annual basis, it's 700 million unique active accounts on an annual basis. And so the changes that we're making that are compounding on each other is applied against a very large opportunity every day, every month, every quarter and annually and that's one of the most powerful things about Twitter is that opportunity presents itself every day because we're pleased to see what's happening.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Great. Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Graham at Canaccord.
Michael Patrick Graham - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about the improving option dynamics. Can you go into a little more detail about what's driving that? And then on the mix of brands versus performance advertisers in the quarter, did you see any changes there? And I'm wondering if some of the M&A chatter had any impact on your conversations with brand advertisers and might that bounce back now? Thanks.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Thanks, Michael. First, in terms of the auction dynamics, we had tweet impression growth which is our available inventory for the tweet ad product, not the live product. We saw tweet impression growth accelerate, and it grew faster than revenue growth. And so, for the first time in a very long time, our ad load went down sequentially. Simultaneously, our click-through rate went up, and it went up not just because of the shift to our video products, our autoplay video product which has a very high engagement rate, it went up because of like-for-like ad product increases, which is very important. We had increases on like-for-like ad products and click-through rates sequentially in every ad product except for one, and that was flat sequentially.
And so, as we see the acceleration in DAU growth, as we see the acceleration in tweet impressions for two consecutive quarters, it's bringing more valuable inventory on to the platform and more scale for advertisers who can be better targeting against (32:43) that results in better click-through rates, better load factor, and better yield. Let me flip it over to Adam to talk about how we can leverage this in the marketplace to drive growth in the future that's faster than today.
Adam Bain - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah, Michael. As Anthony mentioned, we're encouraged by the accelerating growth that we're seeing, and certainly marketers now will be aware and be paying attention to this growth. Video for the second consecutive quarter now is our largest ad product by revenue, and it's also our fastest growing. We've seen two big trends in our marketplace. One is that our current advertiser set is upgrading into these video ads, and then the second opportunity that we see clear ahead of us are these new incremental budgets, these OLV budgets that we've talked about.
We had a great quarter in terms of product execution for our OLV strategy. We've launched now a reach in (33:41) frequency planning and reservation-based buying. We've added metrics from both Nielsen and third-party verification services like Moat. We've also added more pre-roll inventory through our Amplify program, so there's now more supply of great content that brand advertisers can run OLV against.
We've also seen some good early signs of success around our OLV strategy working out through advertisers and agencies. For example, one of the world's largest agency holding companies now is spending OLV budget with us across several industry categories that range from tech and telco and retail and CPG. On the CPG note, one of the CPG advertisers that's running OLV budgets with us remarked to us that Twitter is the only place in social or a feed-based environment that they're running OLV, and so they are, and we are, encouraged by the early success that we're seeing so far around OLV.
To your point around direct response, on the product side for direct response, we launched website conversions objective. The website conversions objective allows us and marketers to optimize towards conversions versus just clicks, so optimizing towards real outcomes. On average, advertisers are seeing two-and-a-half times more conversions when they run this objective versus the clicks. Good example of a marketer using this is the Washington Post. They've been one of our more successful marketers using the website conversions objective. They're seeing five times the conversions now at a cost per conversion that's 88% below their cost per acquisition. So again, a good quarter in terms of product execution for both our brand objectives, and also our direct response objectives.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. And the next question comes from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
A question on the Thursday Night Football, can you just talk about the conversion of new users into regular usage and becoming logged in and using other parts of the service? And then also, how you can personalize the timeline experience going forward to make it more valuable? And then, Anthony, can you just clarify on the 4Q EBITDA, which I think implies $164 million to $179 million? Does that include the $10 million to $20 million of cash costs related to restructuring? Thanks.
Adam Bain - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. On Thursday Night Football, what I'd say – I'd highlight a couple user metrics that we'll share with you and over time, we can share a lot more. But I really want to emphasize the point that this is one part of a much broader and a critical strategy for Twitter as it relates to live, and that's to leverage these globally and nationally-recognized pieces of content to build awareness of underserved content. They in and of themselves (36:41) are going to add to our overall usage and audience, but they'll have an indirect benefit to the broader platform, in addition to these other forms of content.
We saw up to 15% of the Thursday Night Football audience on certain games that's logged out. Over time, we'll look for opportunities to bring those logged out users into being logged in by giving them opportunities to participate with the conversation. The curated timeline below the live video are tweets that have always been on Twitter around these events. We're aggregating them into an event timeline that brings the conversation together so you feel like you're watching the game at a bar, in the stadium or in your home with other fans.
And so there is a significant opportunity to do that. It's not currently a priority. The number one priority is quality, and we feel like we've really delivered on that. We are focused on the timeline which is also a priority because that's the key differentiator for us is bringing that connected audience together.
In terms of personalization, we've just scratched the surface. So by game three, we started to bring in to a certain percentage of the users during the game two personalization elements. One was specific tweets from your graph as opposed to a timeline that's being created by everyone and also brought in what we call experts or commentators into the timeline. Over time, we could make the timeline, so it's actually your home timeline and not just about the game. We could also make it about specific areas of interest, if it's the Patriots versus the Chiefs, we could provide a tab that's just for Patriots fans and just for Chiefs fans; for the debates, just for Republicans or Democrats. So there's limitless opportunity to personalize that. I'm going to flip it over to Jack to talk about our great machine learning technology and how it plays a key role in all of that because a key differentiator for us to take the billions of tweets that are happening on Twitter every day about those events and bringing the best to our users in one seamless product integration.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Yeah. We're focused on adding more machine learning and artificial intelligence to everything that we do. The biggest areas of focus are where people spend the majority of their time which is the home timeline and notifications and also making sure that we bias our on-boarding towards topics and interests rather than accounts. In the past, we've definitely biased more towards helping people find individuals rather than meeting them around what they're interested in and what topics they care about most. We think Twitter is strongest around topics and interests and we think we can do a much better job there. We're not just applying machine learning to the core and to the timelines but also to how we think about video as well.
We have some really cool and really awesome technology that enables more and more viewership because we can do just in time compression so we can work on any device type through any network bandwidth and deliver a high quality high definition experience and we're just starting to apply the technology to our live experience and also to Periscope. So we're looking more broadly at everything that we can do around technology and machine learning specifically to improve all of our experiences to make sure that Twitter continues to be the fastest way to see what's happening and also the highest quality way.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
And then, Doug, on your question about fourth quarter EBITDA, it does not include restructuring charges. You're likely asking the question that it looks like the EBITDA is – and margins are a different trend than what we've seen in the prior quarters. What I've said in the past is that we manage margins for the entire year and we really want to allocate our investments across the most important areas and so we don't necessarily manage it by quarter. So if we over-deliver EBITDA in one quarter, we want to reinvest in the next quarter with those areas that we weren't able to invest in, in the prior quarter.
And at the beginning of the year we said EBITDA guidance range of 25% to 27%. We've outperformed. Last quarter, we narrowed that guidance to 26% to 27% and now after third quarter, we've raised it to 27.5% to 28% and that reflects the outperformance but also a desire to still spend back against some key growth initiatives with a discipline. The other thing I'd say about the fourth quarter is it does have some quarter-over-quarter cost trends that are different than the rest of the year. It's our seasonally strongest quarter for advertising and so commissions go up in the fourth quarter relative to the other quarters. Additionally, it's our seasonally strongest third party network quarter, so TAC goes up on a seasonal basis.
And then we're obviously rolling out our live strategy in a very big way with all the shows that we've talked about in programming. So that will require some additional infrastructure expense and hosting and delivery expense. Revenue will come on top of that. But we've frontload the expenses there. And so those are the drivers of some of the quarter-over-quarter changes which, I think, is implied in your question.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. That's helpful. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
And we will get the next question from Twitter. It comes from the account of Deborah Williamson (41:46) and she asks could you provide some color on your sales restructuring from three channels to two?
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
Deborah (41:53), so the overall restructuring move that we're making is taking our three channels. Again, our three channels are direct sales organization which is dealing with the largest brand customers, primarily our mid-market channel which is mostly telephonic in dealing with direct response customers, primarily, and then our third channels are SMB channel. We're essentially taking our first two channels and condensing them down together so that we end up with just two channels. We had a real 80/20 rule in the second channel which is 20% of those customers were driving over 80% of the revenue. So ultimately, we think that by appropriately resourcing the overall managed customer base, we're going to give the right level of service to the right advertiser.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Thank you. And we have time for just one last question. The question comes from Justin Post at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Anthony, a couple questions. Could you just comment on the streaming deals and the overall profitability of those versus your core business just so we can think about that longer term?
And then secondly, just housekeeping, we've got questions on the revenue. If you take the margins you put in the letter and you put them over kind of the different EBITDA numbers you can get to a revenue number, and it seems like the range could be 2,500 to 2,600 (43:20). So I just wanted to just verify that and we're thinking about it the right way. Thank you – for the year.
Anthony Noto - Twitter, Inc.
Sure. From a cost standpoint, the live initiative really builds on the back of the Amplify program that Adam and the team built over four years ago and that have partners with content owners on revenue splits.
From an economic standpoint, we approached this from the beginning as an investment area but one that does not require us to lose money. And so we're very pleased with the economic profile of the deals that we've done. They're positive from an economic standpoint, and there's a lot of ancillary indirect benefits, but the NFL deal and the rest of the deals individually, we're trying to drive towards profitability on each one of those and as we leverage the model that we have, it's worked very well. There's a lot of creative things our team is able to do that reduces some of the economic burden. The ads that we get in the NFL games are obviously not every ad, and so it significantly reduces the cost exposure that we have to that content, and that's just one of many ways that we put these different content deals into an economic envelope that works for our business.
I think we got another question from Anthony DiClemente that said, what does that bode for the future. I think the important thing for our business relative to others is we're helping these media companies reaching younger audience. As I mentioned, 70% of our audience for the debate and the NFL has been less than 35. We're helping them reach a global audience, and we're helping reach people on mobile. And we're doing it in a unique way. We're not just putting video on the platform.
And so we bring all those benefits to the table, and we also partner. We don't put our brand first. We put our partners' brands first, so we're simulcasting much of the content, and so it's better for them in a way that's just not about advertising dollars. And that's a key differentiator that we continue to plan to leverage.
As it relates to the range, I think you're referring to the full year range. I don't want to cite any specific numbers. You obviously are very good at math, but our goal was to give you EBITDA and EBITDA margin range but not talk about specific numbers against that range even from the endpoints because it's so wide.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Krista Bessinger - Twitter, Inc.
Great. Thank you. I'll just hand it back to Jack for any closing remarks.
Jack Dorsey - Twitter, Inc.
All right. Thanks, Krista. We appreciate everyone joining us a bit earlier today. As we've shown, our core product initiatives are working with accelerating growth in daily active usage, tweet impressions and time spent, and we believe revenue growth will follow. We're being disciplined about how we invest in the business with a strong plan to simplify our efforts and driving Twitter toward GAAP profitability in 2017. And we look forward to sharing further updates on our progress over the coming months. Have a great day.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Great. Thank you. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q2 Earnings Conference Call. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; COO, Adam Bain; and CFO, Anthony Noto.
We hope you've had a chance to read our Shareholder Letter published on our Investor Relations website shortly after the market closed.
Like last quarter, we'll begin with just a few prepared remarks, before opening the call directly to your questions. During the Q&A, we'll take questions asked via Twitter, in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the #TWTR.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call, such as our outlook for Q3 and the full-year of 2016 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
Also, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our Shareholder Letter. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
And finally, this call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey - Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Krista. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're going audio-only for today's earnings call, and we'll spend some time on Periscope after this call to take a few questions.
We continue to see steady growth in both audience and engagement. What makes our audience growth this quarter notable is we can see directly the link between the product changes we made and our growth. We're making the right decisions in our products, and it gives us a foundation for future growth. We're working every day to make Twitter faster, more intuitive, and easier to use. You've already seen us take some big steps here, like the changes to the timeline, and the announced changes to the character account and reply rules. And there's more changes like these on the way.
Continued growth also involves educating people about why to use Twitter, for the fastest way to see and share what's happening and comment on it. That drives everything on our service, especially news and social commentary.
Seeing and sharing what's happening also includes live video. We have some exciting momentum here with Periscope as well as with live-streaming video on Twitter. People can now watch an event like the Republican or Democratic National Conventions directly on Twitter and talk about it in the same experience.
We're partnering with the providers of the world's most popular live content to bring more and more of those events on to Twitter together with the conversation. All this work is planting seeds for meaningful contributions to our continued growth.
With that, let me hand it back over to Krista for questions.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Operator, we're ready. If you could go ahead and poll for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Great. And our first question comes from Ross Sandler at Deutsche Bank. Ross, please go ahead.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Just two questions, one for Jack and then one for Adam or Anthony. So Jack, on the improving engagement, can you parse for us how much of that's being driven by the mix shift to video content and live video content that you're embarking on, and then how much is being driven by some of the product tweaks that you and your team are making? A little bit of color there would be helpful.
And then, Adam and Anthony, can you talk about the economics of all these deals that you've been signing with the sports leagues of late? Should we assume these deals are rev share deals like the old TV Amplify, or are there minimum guarantees involved? And should we expect these to be profitable right out of the gate, or will they potentially initially weigh on margins and then pay off in the long term? How do we think about that? Thank you.
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Ross. It's Anthony. First on engagement. The improvement in engagement that we're seeing is driven by product changes not associated with the live premium content that we've launched. As you may know, we've only done two events, and we're in the middle of our third event, since we announced the live-streaming premium content initiative. We did a test with Wimbledon. Last week, we did the Republican National Convention, and we're in the middle of the Democratic National Convention today. And that's as it relates to the live premium content experience, which is what I think you're asking specifically about.
Our engagement metrics did improve across a variety of different metrics that we look at. In the past, we've talked about the importance of daily active users, and that grew. And the DAU to MAU ratio remained stable. We also saw an improvement in user active minutes, up double-digits. We saw an improvement in tweet impressions, up double-digits as well on a year-over-year basis. Searches also increased double-digits year-over-year, and then last, DMs increased at a double-digit rate year-over-year. So, strong performance on engagement across all the metrics that we look at.
As it relates to the economic deals, we're focused on live sports, live news and politics, and live entertainment. And those deals economically build on the success of the program that Adam and our team built over the last four years in Amplify with 250 media partners. Those deals aligned economics to revenue splits, and the deals we're currently doing reflect that type of arrangement and building on the success we've had with our partners, shared economic interest on both sides of the equation. So, it fits very nicely into our overall economic model and is a great way for us to bring our audience more of what they want.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Great. And the next question comes from Anthony DiClemente at Nomura.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Thank you for taking my questions. I guess, Anthony, just to follow-up on that, I think most people are wondering, how do we explain the implied deceleration in third quarter revenue, you know, expectations in your guidance in light of the improvement in user engagement that you were just mentioning?
And specifically, just wondering if you can give us a sense for some of the – what's factored into your third quarter guidance in terms of user trends, whether it be MAU trends, DAU trends, and then what about these big events that we have coming up in the third quarter, the Olympics, presidential election, political spending and the new spending associated with those NFL deals? And then I have a follow-up.
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. On the overall revenue growth, we have seen a slowdown in the year-over-year growth rate of our owned and operated revenue. We've broken that out since late last year, so you have a clear visibility into it, given the rise in our off-network ad revenue.
We've talked about that slowdown being driven from a transition from owned and operated ad revenue, reflecting the growth in both number of advertisers as well as spend per advertiser. And as we've penetrated the largest spenders, our oldest and longest relationship spenders in DSO U.S. advertising, we've transitioned more to revenue being driven by average revenue per advertiser, moving from two drivers of growth to one driver of growth. And so, that is one of the explanations behind the deceleration in owned and operated ad revenue.
As it relates to the guidance, I'd make a couple of points. Similar to our approach in the last nine quarters, we're evaluating what's already happened in July through today, obviously, how the quarter ended last quarter in June, and then factoring in what we have in bookings and what we anticipate happening from a number of different things in this quarter that are unique. A couple of those things are unique in that they're once-in-a-while types of things, like the election as well as the Olympics. But the quarter itself is also normally back-end loaded; and, of course, we do have the live-streaming product that will launch in a more considered way in September.
I would note that the NFL live-streaming deal, while we're really excited about it and we've achieved some success in the marketplace on the advertising business, we'll only have two games in September, so two games in the entire quarter. And so, the impact of that will be proportional to the total number of games that we have. And so, we're giving you a view, wide range, frankly, and ultimately what we'll report, we'll be able to share with you the details behind it.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
So, I guess, another follow-up there is – maybe it's simplistic, but how do you reaccelerate advertising? I think in your Shareholder Letter, you talked about needing to take share of social marketing budgets in view of the competition out there and then moving into premium video budgets, moving into performance. So the short question is how do you do that? And maybe it's a question for Adam. I know Adam has been working on tools for video ad buys and different things for marketers. So, just want to hear how you guys can really reinvigorate the Twitter ad business from here? Thanks.
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
There are a number of factors on the supply side; I think your question is more tied to the demand side, so let me flip it over to Adam.
Adam Bain - Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, hey, Anthony. So, in terms of reacceleration, I think, you know, we've been talking about two big opportunities that we see ahead of us; one in video, and particularly in the online video space, online video budgets; and the second one is on DR and performance budgets.
On the video side, we have become a video-centric platform. Video is now the number-one ad format in terms of revenue on Twitter. It's interesting, because just a year ago, those set of products did not exist. So, we've seen a continuation of some of these trends overall, where promoted tweet advertisers were upgrading into video.
There is a whole new set of video budgets out there today. These are these online video budgets. It's about a $10 billion marketplace in the U.S. These are video budgets that today we basically don't qualify for, since the spend is going in other areas. There's a set of products and features that we're in development on to land those budgets. We have some good signs of early success around video, and especially around these online video budgets in terms of incrementality.
The NFL and live-streaming strategy that Anthony just talked about, we're seeing really strong demand for the NFL packages. We've already sold through a meaningful percent of the inventory that we control, and a good number of those advertisers, these premium advertisers, have signed up, people like Anheuser-Busch, Verizon, Sony and Nestlé. And what's most interesting to me about those deals are that the advertisers are funding the budgets from the online video part of their letters, so something that we hadn't gotten access to before which we're now getting some exposure to.
On the direct response side of the business, this is a $130 billion or so marketplace. It's one again that we have very little share of today, and we have a product-driven approach over a multiple set of quarters to improve the ROI, in terms of better creative targeting measurement for our DR advertisers. Both of those opportunities will get us out of just the social category into other large categories that we compete.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Thanks a lot.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Great. And the next question comes from Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research Group.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious, how much did access to third-party inventory potentially impact your ad network revenue? And possibly relatedly, can you explain what might have caused the reduction in TAC there. And a separate question, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on (12:41) disruption that probably will occur at Yahoo! over the next while, and/or the combination of Verizon/Yahoo! will have any impact on your business?
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
As it relates to the third-party ad business, I'll talk specifically to the TAC which the improvement was from an improvement in each of the elements of TAC as opposed to just the mix shift.
And then, as you probably have already done the calculation on, our third-party ad revenue was 10% of total ad revenue in the quarter, it was down from 12% in the prior quarter, so it was down sequentially and that was tied to a number of factors. I'll flip it over to Adam to talk about.
Adam Bain - Chief Operating Officer
Sure. We saw actual strengths in our third-party ad business for the DR objectives – the web DR objectives, people that are advertisers that are going after website, clicks, and conversions. So, while that grew, it was offset by weakness that we saw on the Mobile App install business.
We had some infrastructure issues that affected reporting, ad reporting in the Mobile App business for the quarter, issues that we've largely resolved. But, we still have a lot of work to do for our advertisers to prove ROI, both on the owned and operated and across the network.
In terms, Brian, of your other question on the Yahoo!/Verizon overall impacting the ad business. I think overall, we continue to see these two huge opportunities ahead of us, both on the video budgets and online video, in particular. This is money that both have moved off of TV and money that's coming in from traditional display and then also overall DR. We've laid out a pretty cohesive plan on the product side and the go-to-market side for how we're going to approach landing those budgets. And I think ultimately, that's what is going to impact our business, our ability to continue to grow share in those ways.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
Got it. Thank you very much.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Great. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan at UBS.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two, one for Adam. Maybe we can get a sense as you roll-out, continued roll-out, sort of audience measurement and audience platform tools for advertisers, what sort of feedback you're getting on advertising, not only just on Twitter but off Twitter, and how they are thinking about that Twitter audience, so the 800 million visitors, in terms of calculating ROI or reach?
And then maybe for Anthony, in the first quarter and second quarter of the year, we saw pretty sizable beats on the EBITDA line, 29%, 30% type adjusted EBITDA margins, and yet you kept the adjusted EBITDA guide for the year in the 26% to 27% range. Just want to understand a little bit of the thought process around that, given half the year behind us, and maybe calling out some of the investments that might put pressure on the margins? Thanks.
Adam Bain - Chief Operating Officer
Hey, Eric. Let me try and give you an update on the audience measurement side for what we're seeing both on Twitter and off Twitter. Largely, a big chunk of our work has been focused around direct response measurement overall. We've seen some good progress with inside of the quarter.
One of the things that we've done towards the end of this past quarter is auto opt-in any DR objective to expand out into the Twitter audience platform. What we've seen from those campaigns that have run so far is that those advertisers are seeing a larger scale and also equal to or lower cost per acquisition. So, the ROI is looking strong there, but we still have work to do, obviously, to scale it.
Overall, one of the other big initiatives that we have on measurement is with the DoubleClick deal. We saw more of the same of what we talked about this past quarter. In general, on the measurement side, we've run now 65 advertisers through the DoubleClick data. Revenue from those advertisers grew at a faster rate than our overall advertising growth. And of the advertisers that ran in the quarter, a-third increased their spend, so a good nod to ROI.
However, we still have work to do overall, and what we've seen is that when we're measuring desktop impressions on Twitter to desktop conversions, that the data look for Twitter looks accurate and strong. However, about 90% of our impressions are on mobile, and so measuring mobile impressions on Twitter to desktop conversion – this type of cross-device measurement, in general, as an industry needs more work, and it needs work to look more accurate to what we know to be true in terms of what we drive for results for advertisers. So, that's one of the things that we're focused on, along with Google, to help improve this cross-device measurement for marketers.
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Eric. It's Anthony. As it relates to EBITDA margins, we're really encouraged by our ability to manage our costs inter-quarter to exceed expectations both in Q1 and Q2 on EBITDA in absolute dollars and on margin.
In the beginning of the year, we set out a guidance for the full-year, a range for EBITDA margin of 25% to 27%. And so with the outperformance in the first half of the year, we actually raised that guidance to 26% to 27%, and ultimately as we manage through the year, we'll see where it comes out.
I will tell you, when we set the guidance range, we set it for the full-year, and allocate the spending across a number of different initiatives and manage the full-year number, as to just a quarterly number. The third quarter will have slightly lower EBITDA margins, reflecting higher head count coming into the quarter, coming out of Q2 that flows through the rest of the year. And we're also making infrastructure investments in Q3, where revenue against those investments won't be realized until Q4 or in 2017. So, we're taking the opportunity to make that allocation now and building for growth into the future from some of the initiatives we have in live.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for the color.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Okay. And the next question comes from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of Ken Sena at Evercore, and he asks, Twitter, you've struck high, major high-profile deals and live-streaming. Can you speak to the exclusivity of the content you've obtained?
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
So, on the live deals that we're doing, I think it's important to sort of solidify the philosophy of our approach. As I mentioned, we're going after three specific vertical categories. And initially our focus is on acquiring rights to nationally and globally recognized content to build awareness of this great experience of Twitter, of bringing live video together with the conversation that's already happening on Twitter in the connected audience, connected to each other.
As we build that awareness, we will also build awareness of underserved content that we'll acquire, as well as news and analysis. In order for us deliver on our brand promise of being the place to come to see what's happening, we need that complete portfolio of content, both live games, live commentary, as well as live news analysis. And ultimately, we want to also serve underserved content, under-distributed content.
Each of these deals is different. Some of the content is exclusive. As an example, The Rally, which is a two-hour show Monday through Friday from 9:00 to 11:00 Eastern. That is an all-sports highlights, news and analysis show that is exclusive to Twitter. Some of the other content is not exclusive generally, but it could be exclusive that it's only free to Twitter, i.e., you don't have to authenticate, and you don't need a pay wall.
So, it's deal-by-deal. But ultimately, trying to create a portfolio approach of free content, no authentication, no pay wall, to really deliver on the connected audience's desire, that's already expressed in what they're talking about on Twitter.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to ask two. First, you talked about in the letter your CPE, and I know you've talked about the advertising business a lot, but I was just hoping to drill down there specifically. And can you talk about how do you get CPE down basically to make the platform more attractive? And do you think it's more a function of scale, targeting, quality of the audience, or something else?
And then secondly, just on live-streaming, can you talk about your confidence in the architecture and the site technology that's just needed to support potentially heavy live-streaming, and then also how Magic Pony plays into that? Thanks.
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Thank you, Doug. On CPE, the decline of 21% sequentially is due primarily to increasing mix of video, autoplay video, but also impacted by declines in like-for-like CPE for certain ad products. Some of the changes in CPE are due to measurement changes we're making that are designed to improve advertiser ROI and bring our CPE more in line with that of our competitive peers. As an example, we've changed the MRC definition from three seconds to two seconds and 100% view to 50% view. And that was done to make our product more competitive with our industry peers that are driving lower prices at greater scale. And we've had the same benefit.
For other ad types, we also were able to both increase supply and improve predicted click rates, both of which negatively impacted CPE. We'll do more in the area in Q3, as Adam alluded to; but ultimately, it's all about driving more demand and driving ROI for our advertisers.
Jack Dorsey - Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Doug. This is Jack. So, we are making sure that first and foremost that we focus on the quality of the experience and that the experience stays up. So we're putting a lot of thought and effort into our architecture and infrastructure around live-streaming. We're doing a lot of this both on the individual side with Periscope, but also on the premium content side. So, we're getting more and more confident about our abilities here, because we're really measuring and making sure that we're being thoughtful about how to develop that.
Magic Pony is a fascinating technology that we're really excited about. And what this enables us to do is really open the aperture of how many people can see this and to see an experience that is live with low latency. This technology allows us to digitally reconstruct the stream in real-time, independent of network or device. And that's really cool because it doesn't matter where you are, you can watch that experience on Twitter, and it's going to be the most live with the highest quality. So, we're really excited about this technology. Also complementing all the other deep learning and machine learning that we have in the company that we've been applying most recently around our core experience, on-boarding, the timeline, notifications, and also tweeting. So, this is a technology, deep learning, that we're building a lot more strengthen in. We want be a leader here, because it provides a great lever for every experience that we want to provide in the world.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you, guys.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Anthony, I think you mentioned the DAU to MAU ratio was stable. Can you just help us understand what, roughly – in the U.S., what percentage of your MAUs or your mobile MAUs are DAUs? Just any color there at all would be helpful. And then secondly, could you talk a little bit about the ad load in the quarter, the number of ads shown per mobile user per day? Was that up, down, stable? Just a little help on the ad delivery. Thanks.
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. On ad load, ad load increased both on a quarter-over-quarter and a year-over-year basis, similar to what we've talked about in the past. I think it's also important and implied in your question, is what's the upside in ad load? And so, I want to hit on a couple of key points.
The first point I'd make is that the areas of most incremental growth as it relates to ad load would include international, U.S. non-home timeline, the live data experience. But I think it's also important to note that for the U.S. home timeline, while the incremental benefits from ad load itself are more limited given where we're at, there is a significant opportunity to increase yield over time by driving improvements in targeting, creative and measurement that Adam talked about.
And the other point, I'd also note is as we grow audience and grow engagement, we'll create more advertising inventory that's not dependent on ad load, but obviously is incremental.
And the last point I'd make is as we move further and further down the road in our live-streaming content initiatives, we'll create new forms of advertising that are not dependent on ad load at all. For example, what we're doing throughout the fall with the eight deals that we've announced, those live streams will include either mid-roll advertising or pre-roll advertising. Again, video live advertising that's in six second, 15 second or 30 second pods as opposed to being driven by ad load.
As it relates to our U.S. DAU to MAU ratio, we haven't provided that, and we'll give you an update when we think there's a reason to provide some insight into it. But overall, our DAU to MAU ratio as an aggregate company and for our top 20 markets is relatively stable.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
I just want to follow-up on Doug's question about the premium CPEs that you're seeing. Do you think there are any structural factors that are causing that? And then how much further down do you think the CPEs need to come down in order to be competitive with what else is out there in the market? Thanks.
Adam Bain - Chief Operating Officer
Hey, Mark. It's Adam. I'll take the question on CPEs. I think, overall, as we look at it, there certainly is increased competition for social marketing budgets, and we are effectively priced at a premium in terms of a CPE. We're doing a bunch of work to help bring both prices down and improve ROI for those advertisers.
Ultimately, it comes to hitting that ROI target. There are some advertisers, though, that just look at price that are more sophisticated advertisers that look at value and the price to value exchange. We do think that while we have a premium, that premium is justified overall in the market. We have a quality set of audience, quality content, that quality of content has just gotten better with the announcement of our live-streaming strategy.
And overall that quality, we believe, translates to a premium in marketplace. But, we're working over multiple quarters with those advertisers to help prove the ROI there. Ultimately, there's other things that we're working on to help the yield on that inventory; new formats, better measurement, obviously exposing those audiences – or exposing those advertisers to new audiences, or any combination of those.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Great. And we'll take our next question from Twitter. A number of people have asked about recent developments regarding safety, and whether our approach to freedom of expression on the platform has changed. Can you please comment?
Jack Dorsey - Chief Executive Officer
This is Jack. This is really, really important to me and to everyone at the company. So, I want to address both freedom of expression and safety together here, since the two intertwine.
We are not and never will be a platform that shows people only part of what's happening or part of what's being said. We are the place for news and social commentary. And at its best, the nature of our platform empowers people to reach across divides, and to build connections, to share ideas and to challenge accepted norms.
As part of that, we hope – and we also recognize it's a high hope – to elevate civil discourse. And I emphasize civil discourse there. Abuse is not part of civil discourse. It shuts down conversation. It prevents us from understanding each other. Freedom of expression means little if we allow voices to be silenced because of fear of harassment if they speak up. No one deserves to be the target of abuse online, and it has no place on Twitter.
We haven't been good enough at ensuring that's the case, and we must do better. That means building new technology solutions, making sure our policies and enforcement are consistent, and educating people about both. We've made improvements in the first half of the year, and we're going to make more. We named safety as one of our top five priorities for this year, and recent events have only confirmed that this is truly one of the most important things for us to improve, and has motived us to improve even faster.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
And our next question comes from Michael Graham at Canaccord.
Michael Graham - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Thank you. I just wanted to ask about the products roadmap for the core Twitter use case. The roadmap that we see looks a little bit sort of incremental, and I think a couple of quarters ago, we were focused on making the core product easier to use and driving conversion and just sort of more mainstream. And I think all the video stuff isn't going to be impactful, but can just talk about how the core Twitter use case is going to look, say, a year or two from now? Do big changes need to happen? Or is the product roadmap that you've mentioned in the Shareholder Letters are what we should expect to see?
Jack Dorsey - Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thank you, Mike. This is Jack. We've been focused on four areas in the core product. And we believe there's a lot more room within these four areas to really build a lot of strength. All of this falls under the line of two of the most important use cases that we want to focus on, which is news. And we think Twitter is better at real-time news and live news than anyone else on the platform – in the world, I should say. And also social commentary. Anyone can comment about what's happening now and share their thoughts, and sometimes those go into conversations.
So, that's what we want to make stronger and also easier. So, four areas that we've been focused on there. Number one is around on-boarding. We've been applying a lot more machine learning and deep learning to our on-boarding, so we can match people faster to their interests. And we believe that that interest drive is really important to us and unique to us. Two, is the timeline where people spend the majority of their time. We've made a number of refinements over the past few months to make sure that we're showing what's most important and what really matters, and enabling people to quickly get back to everything and to recency.
Notifications is another area where we think we can do a much better job, especially around breaking news. And not that we just push you into a tweet that dead ends, but we can enable you to further explore topics around that tweet and that interest.
And then tweeting itself. We've announced some changes, so that we're giving people the full 140 characters. We're making it easier for people to mention folks, which we believe helps encourage a lot more commentary and more conversation. So, we believe there's a lot more room to go in this, and really making sure that we strengthen the news and the social commentary use cases around that.
And on the other side, we believe that we can make these experiences a lot better through live video. So, we've been focusing energy on Periscope, in particular, and integrating that deeper into the Twitter experience, so you can go live from Twitter, from the tweet composed, right away, and also that you can see Periscope in a tweet. Anywhere a tweet can live and be embedded, you can actually see a live Periscope.
On the Periscope side, we're really excited about a recent announcement we made around highlights. Not everyone can catch a Periscope in the moment when it's actually live. Highlights allows you to see the most important aspects of that, and all that comes from our investment in machine learning and deep learning. So, we're looking at a lot of these technologies to make sure that we can provide the best experiences and the best use cases around delivering news faster than anyone else and providing a good sense of the social commentary that's happening on the platform.
Michael Graham - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay. Thank you, Jack.
Operator
The next question comes from Justin Post at Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Great. Thank you. Two questions. First, thinking about all the streaming content you're adding over the year and next year. I'm just wondering about your competitive advantages to win that content. What unique things does Twitter bring and are you getting maybe preferred deals that would be interesting to us?
And then the second thing, on the U.S. revenues down sequentially two straight quarters, has there been a big competitive shift or is there an especially weak ad format that's kind of hitting Twitter? Just trying to understand that dynamics around the U.S. revenues. Thanks.
Jack Dorsey - Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Justin. As it relates to our ability to go out and win deals with partners, I would say a couple of things. We started having conversations with media partners at the beginning of the year, and our value proposition to them is really embedded with a couple of the key differentiators of Twitter.
First and foremost, we have a very large global audience. We have obviously over 300 million logged-in users. We just reported 313 million. We have more than 500 million plus logged-out users, and then we have a very large syndicated audience.
And so, when we sit down with media partners and brands and content owners, we're able to articulate to them the scale of that audience. And the reason why all three audiences matter is because the live premium streaming content product is the same in all three use cases. The video player that sits in the logged-in experience from the app is the same exact experience you'll get in logged out without having to log-in and under syndicated partners, properties as well as connected TV partners.
And because of that, we can actually sell in an audience that's quite large relative to other offerings. What's more important than that is that we know our users' interests. Those logged-in users explicitly express their interests, what they care about, if they're a Red Sox fan, if they're a Jets fan, if they're Republican or Democrat, based on who they're following. And therefore, we can tailor the content that we're delivering to them based on their specific interests. And that delivers a higher-quality audience, not just a scaled audience. And higher-quality audiences reinforce what's already happening on Twitter, and that's a great conversation.
There are already people talking about the National Football League and looking at tweets without any video, live video, on Thursday nights. We can now deliver to that audience the live video combined with a curated timeline, like we're doing for the Democratic National Convention right now, in one complete solution. And that's a connected audience, not just connected digitally but connected to each other. And so, you can experience the live event with the live video and the conversation and benefit from both.
Importantly, there's a few other characteristics about our platform that we communicate to our partners. 80% of our users are outside the United States, 80% of them are on mobile. And a significant proportion of them are 18-year-olds to 34-year-olds, those that are hard to find, those that may not be on pay television. So our value proposition is quite clear. We can help them reach people in different places that aren't necessarily that they're reaching today in the younger demo, and extend the reach. And what that ends up doing is delivering a bigger audience for them, better economics for them and benefits for us. And one of the biggest things about our conversations with them is, we're looking to be their partner. We're looking to be additive. We're not just replicating the experience that's on television; we're combining it with this great timeline and many of the other social features.
Connected audiences drive virality and they drive popularity. And when something happens on Twitter now in live video, that can be pushed out and shared with many others to make the audience even bigger in that moment and experience. And that's allowed us to win a lot of these deals.
The other thing I'd say is, you really have to understand what the partner's goals are. These aren't deals that are sitting on the shelf waiting for somebody to come in to buy. These are deals that we're creating based on understanding their goals and what we can deliver. And so, that's how we've differentiated ourselves.
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
Justin, on the U.S. ad revenue, the U.S. is where our biggest brand advertising relationships historically have been. These are advertisers who primarily have been spending over the years on traditional promoted tweets. And so essentially what we're seeing is that we've had a couple of quarters now where they move from traditional promoted tweets into our video ad products.
In general, we view the shift into video as a good thing. But, it's a multi-quarter approach. We believe, specific to video, but also on the performance side, there's incremental budgets that we currently aren't exposed to on either side, both based on features and some of the ROI pieces. They're both significant opportunities, and we're working hard to land those budgets on Twitter.
Justin Post - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for the detailed answers.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Next question comes from James Cakmak at Monness, Crespi, and Hardt (sic) [Monness Crespi Hardt].
James Cakmak - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thanks. Anthony, appreciate the color on your content strategy. What I would say is when we think about the differentiating factors, how exactly are you planning on communicating that and making that aware, especially when we think about the non-exclusive, not (38:06) nationally recognized brand content that you guys are rolling out? And do you see a scenario where you potentially need to invest in more premium exclusive content?
And then secondly, just Jack, at a high level, I don't think that there's really any doubt in appreciating Twitter as a global and critically important asset. But just when you think about the challenges in obtaining certain budgets, the user growth and the content investments, strategically, can you just help us understand why it makes sense to operate Twitter independently rather than as part of a larger organization?
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
So, as it relates to the economic deals that we're striking, and as well as the quantity of the content that we have on the platform, for us to really deliver on the brand promise of what's happening now in live sports, live entertainment, live news and politics, we have to first and foremost be live. And that means live games and live commentary. We also have to be dependable. We have to be a place that when people come, we have that live content and we have a broad selection, they have access to it, and it's direct from the source. And then last, we want to have conversation around it.
And so, our portfolio approach will allow us to deliver on those three reasons to believe our brand promise of what's happening now. The economic model that we've been able to deploy up until this point aligns our interests. So, we don't have significant liabilities if for some reason we don't achieve certain audience sizes or other economic gains. And we're fortunate in that we understand what audience is already on our platform, and we can communicate that to our partners that have a good sense for what's deliverable without us having to take on a huge economic risk.
Jack Dorsey - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, James. Our board of directors has a fiduciary responsibility to always consider that question. And they're going to focus on that as appropriate, and we presented our 2016 plan and getting ready for our 2017 plan. They're going to hold us accountable for executing that.
As CEO, I've just seen a lot of the benefit of our focus and our disciplined execution over the past year. And the changes we're making to the product focused on the use cases that we believe are important, that real-time live news and social commentary are actually increasing retention and engagement.
And I think there's just so much farther to go in terms of our strength as not only a service of importance, but also a company in the business of importance. And we're focused right now on what matters most, and what we need to fix. And we're seeing really healthy signs that are pointing us in the right direction in terms of what we need to continue to do. So, I have a lot of confidence in the ability, and also that our five priorities are the right ones to drive sustained growth over time.
James Cakmak - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
So, we'll take the next question from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of Rich Greenfield (41:06). And he asks, how can you not give DAU specifics, given that they are the most important metric. Others give it. Why not Twitter?
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
Rich (41:17), each year we reevaluate the metrics that we're going to provide, as well as our approach to guidance. In each of the last two years, in January of 2015 and 2016, we reassess that, and then when we reported fourth quarter results we gave an updated view on what message we'd provide and what guidance. We'll do the same thing at the end of this year. DAU's an important metric, and one that we'll consider. We will give you color along the way to make sure you have a good sense for how we're doing on DAU. I think I'd make a couple of very important points.
First, our monthly active user growth this quarter was driven by a combination of both product and organic benefits combined with marketing benefits. And that's really important. Because the first time in several quarters that we've seen the combination of those two things working together. And we're really encouraged by that.
The second point I'd make is that we also saw growth in daily active users commensurate with the growth of monthly active users. So, the overall DAU to MAU ratio was relatively stable. And that also applies to the U.S., which is also a specific question that somebody asked.
So, we'll provide you the updates as we go and in terms of making a permanent change to the metrics that we report, we'll review those again at the end of the year.
Krista Bessinger - Senior Director-Investor Relations
We'll take one more question from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of Victor Anthony [Bernstein Research] and he asks specifically between marketing initiatives, organic growth and product changes, which had the greatest impact on driving user growth?
Anthony Noto - Chief Financial Officer
So, it was evenly split between in one bucket, product and organic are in one bucket and the other bucket is marketing. It was split 50/50 between those two buckets. And as I mentioned, this is something that we're very happy to see.
In the past, we've talked about our growth in MAU, primarily being driven by marketing and while we had statistically positive results from some of our product changes, it hadn't actually driven an impact that was obvious in the absolute number. And this is the first quarter that's happened. So, an important inflection point for us as a company.
Operator
Yeah. Time for the one final question. It comes from Peter Stabler at Wells Fargo.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions, one for Jack and one for Adam. Jack, wondering if you could give us any color around what you've seen from your Wimbledon initiative, any metrics or just levels of engagement, that event as well as the RNC, DNC conventions. And then a quick follow-up for Adam. Thank you.
Jack Dorsey - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Peter. I'll start by saying that this is – we're really early into the experience, so we're still in a learning phase around these experiences. What gives me a lot of confidence is this is an activity that we've seen on the platform for quite some time, and we just asked the very simple question of like if we were to bring this all together into one screen, what experiences are we able to enable? People are naturally commenting on what's happening within Wimbledon. Elections have always been huge for Twitter and definitely a source of engagement for us in conversation. And it's super early, but we're seeing some really, really good signs and using all that to improve the quality, first and foremost of the experience, and then eventually the reach of it.
Adam Bain - Chief Operating Officer
So, as Jack mentioned, our priority in August, it's important to remember that we want to first focus on quality, and that's both the quality of the video, the latency of the video as well as the quality and relevancy of the curated timeline.
I think one of the things that's really important is that our live-streaming premium content strategy will allow us to leverage something that's very familiar for users. It's very simple to tell people why to use Twitter now. Watch the Democratic National Convention. That's something they understand. That's something they're familiar with.
And when they get to Twitter, it's all there for them. The best tweets that go with the live video. They don't have to understand follows, they don't have to understand what accounts to look for, they don't have to understand hashtags or at signs. So, it's one complete solution. And what we're really focused on today is the quality of video and the quality of that timeline.
Incrementally, throughout August, going into September you'll start see us start to test different mechanisms to drive audience to that experience as well as marketing. And we want to first migrate through organic initiatives to understand how much traffic we can bring through different things, like the timeline itself, like search as well as trends.
And then as we move further along that learning curve, we'll start to add in some marketing initiatives, ultimately building the muscle that will drive the discovery as well as a large-scale audience to these experiences that we know they're looking for. So far the quality has been great and we couldn't be prouder of our team that has built this product and split it up in a matter of months, while we've gotten these deals done. So, we're really encouraged by the success so far. Focus first on quality though.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then if I could, a quick one for Adam. Safety issues also apply to advertisers, of course, and on occasion we've seen brands face some challenges from users. Have you experienced any advertiser hesitation due to this issue? And if so, does live video present any incremental risk for marketers? Thanks so much.
Adam Bain - Chief Operating Officer
Thanks, Peter. Actually, the live premium video strategy that we have provides, we think, incremental value for those marketers. It's a premium environment. It's programming that they know and in many cases love. Things like National Football League, college sports, baseball, et cetera.
So, I think it's content that they are very familiar with in terms of the programming schedule and the like. The difference is now all of a sudden it's available on Twitter. Each one of these deals are on a deal-by-deal basis, in terms of how much ad inventory we receive. Obviously, we'd like to get as much ad control as we possibly can, but each deal is different.
We've only brought the NFL package so far out to the marketplace. It moved very quickly in a matter of weeks in terms of our ability to take in that demand that we saw. We have not brought out the next set of content, but we've already seen a tremendous amount of strong interest from advertisers on content outside of the NFL.
So, it's early yet because we don't have – the content hasn't actually launched yet with ads; but I'd say, I'm pleased so far with the demand that we're seeing. And the demand that we're seeing is unique in that it's coming from these online video parts of the house on the advertiser side and the agency side versus just the traditional social media budgets that we're exposed to.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Hi, everyone and welcome to our Q1 earnings Periscope. We have with us today our CEO, Jack Dorsey; COO, Adam Bain; and CFO, Anthony Noto. We hope you had a chance to look at our shareholder letter, which we posted on our Investor Relations website shortly after the market closed.
Like last quarter, we will begin with just a few prepared remarks before we open the call directly to your questions. During the Q&A, we will take questions asked via Periscope and Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. To submit a question via Twitter, please direct it to @TwitterIR using the hashtag #TWTR.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call such as our outlook for Q2 and 2016 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please also take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today’s date and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by laws.
Also, during this call, we will discuss certain on GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables in our shareholder letter and these non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And finally, this call in its entirety is being broadcast over Periscope and being webcast from our Investor Relations website. And an audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey
Thanks, Krista. Hi, everyone and thanks for joining us. A couple of things before we start with your questions.
This is our first quarterly update after laying out our long-term strategy and priorities. And as we shared last quarter, our focus is on live. Twitter has always been the best place to see what’s happening now. Whether it’s breaking news, entertainment, sports or everyday topics, only Twitter lets you connect with people anywhere in the world with live conversation. Think of President Obama congratulating Elon Musk on historic SpaceX landing or the world celebrating the legacy of the legendary artist, Prince. Only Twitter lets you follow these historic moments, join in the conversation and share it with others.
We made a lot of progress on product innovation this quarter, particularly with live video and our refined timeline and people love it with less than 2% opting out. We remain focused on improving our service to make it fast, simple and easy to use. We also announced a significant deal with the NFL a few weeks ago. As soon as we announced that deal, almost every league in the world contacted us, because they want to provide an even better experience for their fans.
And with that, we will move on to your questions.
Krista Bessinger
Great, thank you. Sabrina, we are ready to go ahead and now take the first question, please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] 
Krista Bessinger
Great. And it looks like the first question is from Anthony DiClemente at Nomura. Anthony, please go ahead.
Anthony DiClemente
Thanks a lot for taking my questions. One for Anthony and one for Adam. I know you don’t give forward guidance on users or the active user trajectory, Anthony, but can you just give us or speak to trends that you are seeing in terms of new users added, resurrected users and retention? I think last quarter you talked about users from performance-based marketing having higher retention rate. And obviously, if you want to give us guidance on users for next quarter, I think we will take it. And then another one for Adam, just in the shareholder letter, it talked about brand marketers not increasing spend as quickly in the first quarter. I realize that monetization is still growing, but in terms of the deceleration, are dollars shifting back to traditional media platforms, do you think? Are they shifting to other major online platforms? I guess just in your conversations with brand marketers, how are they looking at the strength or weaknesses of the Twitter platform versus other major media platforms that brand marketers might pursue? Thank you.
Anthony Noto
Thanks, Anthony. I will take your first question. In terms of MAU growth, the primary drivers of the MAU growth in the quarter were both seasonality and marketing initiatives. Of course, the continuous improvement in our product underlines the benefit and seasonality that we are seeing, which is not large enough for us to break it out specifically both as we talked about in the shareholder letter through our contributions there. As it relates to the funnel dynamics, we benefited in the quarter from both on improving the top of the funnel as well as retention. And again, the retention improvements reflect the continuous improvement in the product starting to impact the ability to retain a larger top of the funnel this quarter. In terms of our outlook for Q2, we are not providing a Q2 MAU outlook. In the past when we have provided an MAU outlook, it’s because we felt there were some unusual underlying trends that we need to point out and that’s not the case today.
Adam Bain
And Anthony, I will take your question around the advertising side. On the advertising side, overall as we mentioned, brand spend didn’t grow as quickly as we expected. In the quarter, video was strong, but that was partially offset by some softness that we saw in older legacy brand products. So, these are promoted products, for example, without video. In terms of the opportunity ahead, we see a clear opportunity ahead to increase our share of the brand advertising market, especially around video. Some of these new video opportunities will, we believe, grow budgets that we have access to. We also hear from marketers that there is nothing in the world like Twitter in terms of as a marketing platform. Twitter is that live connection to culture for marketers and that’s both unique and special in the brand universe. Live is where – is what’s most valuable in the ad business. So, to make us even more powerful, we are working on some video tools. These are things like reach and frequency planning, demographic targeting and verification, which will rollout this coming fall to coincide with our NFL deal of our live streaming strategy.
Anthony DiClemente
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Great, thank you. And the next question comes from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan.
Cory Carpenter
Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Cory Carpenter for Doug Anmuth. Maybe a quick question on the NFL deal which I know you guys discussed in the letter. Could you maybe just talk through how you thought about it from a user acquisition or engagement perspective and then maybe also how you are thinking about it in terms of monetization? Thank you.
Adam Bain
Sure and thank you for the question. As Jack mentioned, Twitter has always been known for the place to go to see what’s happening in the world right now. And we have been real time. And the reason we have been real time is because our tweets are publicly available for everyone to see and they are broadly distributed. And live is the best manifestation of real time. We already have live connections, live conversations and live commentary on the platform. And it’s an opportunity for us to add live premium content to those conversations in that commentary. And so yes, the NFL deal is important and I will talk about that in more detail, but we are focused on live premium content in all sports, news and politics as well as entertainment to bring together for our users what they are already talking about, what they already care about.
As it relates to the NFL, we know that on Thursday nights during the 3-hour telecast of Thursday Night Football, we have millions of users looking at tweets about that game. And they are creating tens of millions of impressions that we know are very valuable to them and very valuable to our partners, both the NFL and of course our advertisers. And so being able to bring the live streaming game into the product with that live commentary those live conversations is a complete solution. It’s a complete solution for those tens of millions that are already on our platform and care about the NFL and the tens of millions of NFL fans that are not on the platform. And so we see it as the product that will be the same for logged in, logged out and syndicated users. It’s the same video, the same ads, the same analytics and we can deliver in an instant a very transparent way to tell people to come to Twitter and deliver on that instantly. We have talked about the importance of us clearly communicating our value and delivering on it instantly. Live sports, live premium content is a way to communicate them, that’s very familiar to people, something we know they want based on their interest on Twitter and to deliver on an instant, not just with that live video, but all the great conversation and tweets that are attached to it and expose those that having used Twitter to that great content and those that are a complete solution. So, we are really excited about the opportunity to use it as a complete solution.
Jack Dorsey
On the advertising side, we control some of the inventory in the pre-game, in the game and also post-game. This follows along a multiyear, 3-year history that we have had with the NFL of bringing premium content on to the platform and also bringing it out to Madison Avenue. The demand for this program has been incredibly strong for marketers. Only had it in market for about a week, we have already signed up one major sponsorship to the package and it’s important to note that sponsorship actually was funded from video budgets instead of social media budgets. So it’s a good example of how the live streaming strategy that we have overall is aiding our ability to go after these video budgets that we talked about coming this fall.
Adam Bain
I want to point that this watching with Twitter, watching a live event has been something we have seen for 9 years now. It’s pretty phenomenal. And this is really about making sure that make it even easier for people to see these games and to see these events and actually tweet about them. But more importantly, they get to see all the content on Twitter right away. So very easy way to get in, but they could see all the individual produced content, including the premium content as well.
Cory Carpenter
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thank you. And the next question comes from Ross Sandler at Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler
Thanks Krista. I just had one for Jack and then one follow-up for Adam. Jack, there was a number of comments in the letter about increasing engagement, so I guess can you just parse that out a little bit for us, what kind of increases or impacts are you seeing from the new algorithmic timeline and given that you have made a bunch of different changes to the core timeline product, what’s the best way for us to measure the increases in engagement, is DAU over MAU still the most important metric and if so, how does that look compared to prior periods. And then the question for Adam, I guess just a follow-up from the previous questions, how does the overall ad market look heading into 2Q, do you expect the work that you guys have been doing around improving measurement and targeting, particularly on the DR side, to start to help the ad revenue growth and if so, when should that happen this year? Thanks.
Jack Dorsey
Thanks Ross. The refined timeline, we are really proud of. We are really proud of what it’s been doing for the service and what it’s been doing for people using Twitter. As you know, a lot of our folks spend the majority of their time in the timeline and the more technology we apply to this, while at the same time giving people control to tailor their experience, the better effects we see. We have seen increases in tweets and replies and re-tweets, and also likes, obviously. So we want to continue to make sure that we are refining that timeline and making it better and better and better. So when people come back to Twitter, they see what is meaningful and a quick pull to refresh and they go back to recent. I will let Anthony take the second part of your question.
Anthony Noto
Sure. Ross, as it relates to engagement, we have a number of factors that we look at as it relates to engagement. The one that is probably the most important is daily active users. It’s one that we continue to focus on as well as a number of other factors, including searches and Direct Messages. So we will continue to look at that metric as well as the others that we have talked about in the past.
Adam Bain
And Ross, to answer your question on the overall ad market, if we look across the board, we grew – we had strong growth internationally, 46% on international growth ex-FX and 39% growth here domestically. We look internationally and we saw across Europe some marketers who held back spend in the first half, holding it back for the Olympics and things like the Champions League. There were some other areas like Brazil and some other major categories. Tech, QSR and retail is good examples of big categories that were little bit softer than we expected. It juries out a bit since the whole category hasn’t reported yet to see how that’s going to shape up across the board. To your point around Q2, we are going to continue to move our marketers from these legacy promoted tweets into promoted video. Promoted video performs incredibly well. It’s – we just recently gotten back a return on ad spend study for video during this past fall season. We saw a $6 return on ad spend for a major beverage manufacturer. So for every dollar that they put in Twitter, it returns $6 back to the register. They told us it was best in category. And so with that type of ROI, we are going to continue to move people through video. In terms of targeting creative and measurement on the direct response side of the house, we have got a lot underway there. One point that I will make is around our dynamic product ads. When we last talked at earnings, DPAs had just bit into an early beta. We have now expanded the beta. At the time we are seeing a 2x lift in click through rates. We are now seeing a sustained rate of 2x lift in click through rate and we are also seeing twice the conversion rate through the funnel. So those strong results mean that it’s ready to open up even more. DPAs take a little bit of time for a marketer to implement. So in Q2, we are going to start opening up through the ads API, so partners can help onboard them as well. So we should be ready for the fall back to school season and the holiday in Q4 season.
Krista Bessinger
We will take the next question from Twitter comes from the Twitter account of Arvind Bhatia. And he asks, is there a way to quantify how much Twitter’s advertising revenue will benefit from the election this year?
Jack Dorsey
Hi Arvind. So while we are not going to get into the quantification of the election, I think as we think about whether it’s the Olympics or the elections or things like the Euro League championship, there is a huge opportunity for consumers on Twitter to see really relevant content now and certainly marketers and content partners to have access to new products and features they didn’t have the last time each one of these events happened. During these events, it’s really when Twitter shines for marketers. These live audiences and the connection that marketers can have to them are rare in the online ad space. And so we stand out from the rest of the market around these events. When we think about the elections, direct response part of election cycle, which is around fund raising, marketers can now bring tailored audiences to bear. In the Olympics, we are going to see a lot more video and video advertising being used. So we think there is going to be great opportunities to showcase how far we have come last time around.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thank you. And the next question comes from Heath Terry at Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry
Great. You mentioned the increase in ad load during the quarter, I was wondering if you could give us a sense how much of the slowdown in growth that you are projecting for Q2 is from a more limited ability to increase ad load and as we start to think more and more about the network opportunity off of Twitter, how do you think about the opportunity there from an ad load perspective?
Jack Dorsey
Thanks Heath. And in terms of ad load, ad load Q1 was down sequentially from the fourth quarter, so no inventory issue in Q1. As we look through the rest of 2016 and beyond, the areas that have the most incremental growth in monetization would include international home timeline and international non-home timeline, U.S. non-home timeline, logged out and syndication. We also have a significant opportunity to increase the yield of the current inventory that we are selling, improve its monetization. And that’s from a number of factors, continuing to scale our advertisers, our goal long-term is to have millions of advertisers like our competitive peers. And that’s a big driver of continued improvement of the yield of our current inventory that we are selling, in addition to the fact that we are focused on targeting creative and measurement that will also drive yield. So those are the biggest opportunities that we look forward. Then on the top side, what we are seeing saying from a strategy standpoint is that direct response advertisers are really responding well to the new inventory that exists across Twitter Audience Platform, we are seeing actually advertisers that are testing and DR advertisers that are testing into those new areas of inventory actually grow budget with us. So that’s we are off to a good start, the good signup.
Heath Terry
Great. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan at UBS.
Eric Sheridan
On the EBITDA margin, obviously you showed a tremendous amount of leverage in the model in Q1 on the EBITDA line, I want to understand a little bit what drove that leverage in Q1. And then also on the flip side on stock based compensation, that continues to run a little bit higher than what we have thought in some of the future periods, maybe you can give investors some sense of how stock based compensation might traject longer term? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Sure. We had a very strong Q1 on the profitability front, EBITDA margins on a gross GAAP revenue of 30%, even higher on a net revenue basis excluding TAC. The quarter really reinforces our belief of the opportunity to drive long-term margins of 40% to 45% on EBITDA basis relative to net revenue. In fact our R&D expense and our G&A expense as a percent of our revenue are already where we would like them to be in the long-term to support that EBITDA margin as a percent of net revenue of 40% to 45%. The efficiencies we have in the quarter are directly related to employee expenses, infrastructure expenses and software development. As we think about the longer term, we are going to balance improvements in profitability with the growth opportunity we see in front of us. We want to make sure we are capturing those growth opportunities and investing in them appropriately to maximize shareholder value of the long-term. But we want to do that in a disciplined way, so continued improvement in profitability, but not sacrificing those growth opportunities. Q1 happened to be a quarter which we did less investment compared to Q2. And ultimately, our margins for the full year reflect the level of investment that we plan on making, with some lumpiness by quarter depending on the magnitude of the investment. As it relates to stock-based compensation, I would make a couple of points. It’s our goal to get our stock-based compensation as a percent of revenue down to the high single-digits as a percentage of revenue comparable to our competitive peers in the technology sector and consumer Internet in particular. We have continued to manage our net and gross dilution on an annual basis to be equivalent to where they are. And ultimately, the scale in revenue against the largely fixed costs or declining costs will allow us to get there over the next couple of years.
Krista Bessinger
Great, thanks. And we will take the next question from Periscope. The question is, why not monetize Periscope and Vine?
Adam Bain
I will take that one. We actually are monetizing Periscope and Vine by bringing that creative canvas into Twitter and allowing marketers to bring that canvas into Twitter and do targeting campaigns and measurement through the tools that we have available on the platform. We plan to expand the promoted video with Periscope option for marketers this quarter by bringing in the Android platform as well as up until now it’s just been available on iPhone. We have seen incredible creativity as well recently with marketers taking advantage of the Periscope option in Twitter. Two great examples of this were Doritos that went live during the Super Bowl and promoted the Periscope on Twitter and also Kohl’s, the department store who went live during the Oscars and brought a behind the scenes red carpet live on Twitter through the promoted tweets in Periscope.
Krista Bessinger
Great, thanks. And the next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research.
Brian Wieser
Thanks for taking the question. First, I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the brand spend in the quarter. I was wondering to what degree do you think that negativity out there in terms of sentiment depressed or otherwise might had impacted how brands are thinking about it? And part of that is to the extent that potentially this rebounds that might contribute to some upswing. A separate question rather dynamic product ads is what you are indicating that you are suggesting there could be acceleration in the second half from direct response advertisers? And do you think that would generally benefit owned and operated or would it impact network inventory more so?
Jack Dorsey
Great. Let me take the first one. I don’t believe that sentiment affected the brand spend. And we see a couple different proof points on that. Probably the biggest proof point is that in Q1, we go through and do strategic upfront deals. These are our relationships, similar to TV, upfront relationships with our largest advertisers and also agency holding companies. So in Q1, we resigned three of our global agency holding company deals. These are centered around video and these are all up collectively 40% year-on-year. On the individual upfronts that we do with large customers, we also have – are up over 40% year-on-year with them as well, which indicates some back half opportunity to the year especially around video.
To your point around DPA, the DPA technology is using the TellApart technology. So this is the first real example that we have of bringing TellApart technology on to Twitter’s owned and operated platform. It’s exposing us to new budgets, these remarketing budgets that we have never had before. The signs are good in terms of the lift, both the click-through rates and the conversions, which show that it’s performing for marketers all the way through the funnel. What we need to do next now is bring those remarketing budgets on to the platform at scale. In order to do that, we are lighting up these API partners and other third-parties to help bring that quicker to the platform. Will it work? It should work for the Twitter Audience Platform in a big way, but it also will work for Twitter owned and operated both logged in and also logged out since remarketing budgets can take advantage of the targeting that’s available for logged out users.
Brian Wieser
Great, thank you very much.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak
Questions, I have two. There is a lot of focus on live events and kind of live audiences. I know in the first quarter, we had the Super Bowl. Could you just talk about the Twitter live audience around the Super Bowl kind of what you saw in 2016 versus 2015, how has it changed year-on-year, bigger, smaller etcetera? And then the second thing, in the investor note, it sounds like you are pretty focused on specific plans to go after new online video ad budgets. Can you just talk to some of the changes you see that are being made to the video ad product to go after more dollars? Thanks.
Jack Dorsey
Sure. In terms of the Super Bowl in particular, we haven’t called out the specific performance of that. Overall, the NFL for the full season performed very strongly at a Tweet impression basis in addition to the live audience that was watching tweets while also the telecast window was open. And so those are two things that we analyzed and two of the reasons why we are so aggressive in trying to create relationships with the National Football League in our fourth year that’s really extending what we have already had for 3 years in Amplify. And so, the NFL season was a real success on Tweet impressions and that live audience measurement. Now, let me turn over to Adam on the online budgets.
Adam Bain
Yes. So, on the online budgets, these are a set of budgets that we don’t have exposure to today, because they require a certain set of features that we are working on right now. These are features like demographic targeting and validation, GRP and TRP, targeting and reporting. So, it’s a function of putting these features in place. We believe that we can tap into incremental video budgets when we put those features in place. The features are actually in production – are in development right now and are going to be timed to launch with our NFL deal and our live streaming strategy for this fall. And as I mentioned, we are already seeing good response from the market by the fact that advertisers are funding, for example, the NFL deal with the video side of the house instead of where we typically pull money from on the online ad budget.
Krista Bessinger
Okay, thanks. And the next question we take will be from Periscope. The question is will you incorporate Periscope during the NFL games?
Jack Dorsey
Thank you for the question. The great thing about Twitter and the three brands we have is they all can work together as it relates to video. And part of our relationship with the National Football League does include Periscope content, shoulder programming pre-game and behind the scenes and that was part of the deal that we struck with them. And its part of the other deals that we are working on with other live, sports live entertainment and live news and politics opportunities. So, we are really excited about leveraging all three elements of it. And it’s one of the unique things about Twitter that we think can position us to capture our fair share of these opportunities.
Krista Bessinger
Okay, thank you. And the next question we will take is from Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets.
Andrew Bruckner
Hello, this is Andrew on for Mark. Just a quick question with the addition of the board seats and Leslie Berland coming on, I am wondering what other holes you are looking to fill in your team? And then with regard to Leslie Berland, if you can talk about your changed marketing strategy if at all or any updates on the marketing strategy? Thank you.
Jack Dorsey
Yes, I will take the first part. Thank you, Andrew. We are continuing to look for new board members and you will see more additions this year. We are really proud of the additions of Hugh and Martha to our board, because there is a lot of guidance and accountability to what we need to do as a service. My focus is a lot on recruiting this year and specifically into engineering and to products. So, we are looking for a whole lot more leadership there.
Adam Bain
And then as it relates to marketing strategy, about a year ago, we talked about the need and opportunity for Twitter to clearly communicate our value and deliver in an instant and we talked about that for the first time. We talked about the importance of products, content and marketing all working together synchronously to maximize the impact to be able to do that. Leslie has come in and joined the team and has already had an impact. She has integrated both our advertising cross-functional groups, marketing cross-functional groups. So, those focused on advertisers and those focused on consumers into one cohesive cross-function and they are developing first principles. They are developing integrated marketing plans. But ultimately, it ties back to that overall strategy of combining product, content and marketing to deliver integrated experience for our users, both logged in, logged out and syndicated so that we can clearly communicate that value and deliver in an instant. So, we are really excited about having her on the team, which has already had an impact.
Andrew Bruckner
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Okay. And our next question comes from James Cakmak at Monness, Crespi, Hardt.
James Cakmak
Alright, thanks. Adam just wanted to talk about the Google relationship I understand DCM is going into alpha test here in the coming weeks. Can you just talk about what we should expect and how accretive this relationship can actually be as we look into the second half of this year? And then I guess, Jack or Anthony, on the users, this is obviously something that gets a lot of scrutiny, but you had the DAUs, the MAUs, but at the same time, you talked about the 800 million on and off platform is users even the right way to think about it, just how do you guys think about it internally and is there some method that we should continue to want to see? Thanks.
Adam Bain
Hey James, I will take your first one. So on the DoubleClick side, as you recall, there is two parts of the DoubleClick deal. DCM as you mentioned, which is around measurement. And DBM, which is around ad buying. So let me start with the DCM piece measurement. In the quarter, we expanded the beta over a dozen advertisers and we have run hundreds of campaigns now through DCM. We have seen two things. One, when measuring desktop impressions to desktop conversions, the data looks accurate through DCM and the results for Twitter for these campaigns looks strong. So that’s good news. When on the other edge – on the other side of the house, when you look at mobile impressions that are measured through DCM that are measuring desktop conversions, so this cross-device measurement, what we saw through the measurement period is that something that the industry overall needs to address which is that this type of cross-device measurement overall need to work from an industry standpoint. This is something that we are working with Google together on. It’s part of the reasons why we did the DoubleClick deal in the first place is to help solve some of this cross-device measurement for the overall industry. This hits us particularly in an acute way because 90% of our impressions, our ad impressions are on mobile. So cross-device for us is really important part. On the DBM side, Google engineers and Twitter engineers are working on the buying piece for integration. We believe it will be in beta in Q3.
Jack Dorsey
As it relates to your question on users, we like to refer to it as the world’s best connected audience. We are focused on driving repeat usage of that connected audience. And I don’t want to confuse. When we say connected, we mean connected to each other, not just connected to a digital platform. And the value of having that connected audience allows us to be the place to found out what’s happening in world right now because conversations are live, commentary is live and it travels around instantly because of our syndicated partners in both our logged out and logged in experiences. So we are still absolutely focused in total audience, but we want to emphasize the point that we wanted to be the best connected audience, which really reflects our point of difference to all of those audiences.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thank you. And the next question we will take from Twitter comes from the Twitter account of echo to all and he or she asks, can you talk about the progress that you are making on developer relations?
Jack Dorsey
Sure. So we recently announced with Fabric that we have crossed over an important milestone, which is Fabric is now touching over 2 billion devices, which is really important milestone and it shows that Fabric is indispensable for developers across the board. The other piece of our developer relations is moving Fabric customers also through monetization to the degree that they are looking for help for monetization. We saw strong growth in the quarter for MoPub. The amount that we paid to publishers grew 80% year-on-year for MoPub, so more ahead I think there.
Krista Bessinger
Okay. And the next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon at BMO.
Dan Salmon
Hi guys. Good afternoon. A couple of initiatives you mentioned were especially I think Adam, to help the video business we are expanding demographic and verification, might that be something that piggybacks on your relationships with Nielsen and Moat or are there new things to be added there. And then maybe just one follow-up on the renewal of the holding company upfront relationships, just interested to hear how much of the up-tick in spend from them and other large brand advertisers through that process was centered around football and maybe if there is a way to help us gauge maybe what a same-store sales type of number might be for that?
Adam Bain
Sure. So on the first one Dan, on the demographic we are targeting and also verification of audiences, it is going to be an expansion of our Nielsen and Moat relationships, so that we can bring some of the things that video advertisers are looking to measure on the Twitter that hasn’t been available before in mass. And that’s one of the things we are teed up on for Q3 as we open up our video platform in a major way, it also coincide with our NFL deal. In terms of the renewal of the holding company upfronts, we did those before we announced the NFL deal. And as I have mentioned, they are up 40% year-on-year, which indicates the back half opportunity. Those upfronts are centered however, around video. And so the work that we have done with marketers over the last couple of quarters has shown great response. And so I think the agencies are looking at that and having enough confidence to invest in Twitter going forward, especially around video.
Dan Salmon
Great. Thanks, Adam.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler at Wells Fargo.
Peter Stabler
Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to go to the guidance, could you help me reconcile a couple of things here, so we are hearing pretty strong commentary regarding ROI, new advertising products measurement, etcetera, yet sequential guide is a bit perplexing to us, as even mature media companies growing 3% to 5% a year can put up sequential gain in Q2, so I guess is there a suggestion here that current advertisers are pulling back spending as you add new advertisers or if you can just provide a little bit more color here, that would be helpful? Thanks so much.
Anthony Noto
Sure. In terms of the guidance, it reflects a couple of factors. First, the results in Q1, we are at the low end of our expected range. That underperformance relative to the high end of expected range or even the midpoint reflected a weak March and that’s the month of the quarter that underperformed. Obviously, we have gotten through April and have a sense for where April is. And the next two months are really critical to achieving the full quarter outlook that we provided or exceeding it. And so we are providing you the near-term update that we have. I think as it relates to advertiser health and the state of demand for the platform, Adam can talk in this in more detail. But I would just tell you the same thing we talked about last quarter. We have a number of different channels in a number of different geographies. And our largest channel and our largest geography is now about driving share of wallet and that’s our direct sales organization in the U.S. And so the penetration growth of those advertisers has largely run its course and we are focused on driving greater share of wallet. And so some of the slowdown that you see is a reflection of the fact that we are moving from two dimensions of growth for that largest group of advertisers, largest dollar spend of advertisers, to one dimension of growth.
Adam Bain
Yes. And Peter, I would just add that on top of what Anthony just mentioned, in our largest most mature brand channels, we actually actual saw growth in Q1 on a year-on-year basis. And we expect that to continue. Essentially what we expect in Q2, however is that more of these advertisers will trade up from these legacy brand promoted tweets into promoted video products. Again, we think this is a great thing for the platform since video consumes less inventory. It’s a great thing for those marketers. They see great ROI when they use video versus traditional promoted tweet products. And it’s also better for consumers, consumers report enjoying the video ad experience even to a greater degree than what we see in traditional promoted tweets.
Peter Stabler
Thanks so much.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And the next question we will take is from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of Neil Cameron and he asks, does artificial intelligence have a major part to play in your vision for customer service on Twitter?
Jack Dorsey
That’s a great question. We are really excited about machine learning and deep learning and all the advances in technology to make the experience better. And it’s best when they are applied in a very, very thoughtful way. Twitter has always been phenomenal for the past 9 years around customer support. We have had people come on to the platform to talk about their service, to talk about a brand, to talk about a product they just bought. And the brands actually have a conversation with them. And just a few months ago, we released an update to that experience where any brand, any company can take a customer service tweets private and actually handle the situation with a customer privately and direct messaging. And also give them feedback on the experience, so company can know how well it’s doing. We think that’s a great way to start, but we are always looking for new technologies to apply to make that easier for companies to address all of the tweets and to address all of the customers that they see on the platform on a daily basis.
Krista Bessinger
And the next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali at Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef Squali
Thank you very much. Two questions, please. First, starting with Adam, given the focus on video and promoted video, can you just help us one, understand how you actually price video on the platform and maybe the differential if there is one and pricing between promoted video and the promoted tweets, considering the migration you just spoke about. And then Anthony, I think on the MAU issue, you talked about the major drivers being seasonality and marketing initiatives. Can you help us just parse out little bit what these marketing initiatives that had an impact on the quarter were? And then when you say no unusual trends you have seen in Q2, which is the reason you are not necessarily guiding to MAU, are we to understand by that, that we are back to kind of normal seasonality for that metric? Thank you.
Adam Bain
Yes, great. I will take the first one. So, in terms of how we price our video products, they are priced on a cost per video view basis versus these older legacy brand promoted tweets are priced on a cost per engagement. We have seen video be a more effective ad unit for marketers, especially when measuring either the mind or the wallet. We have seen video now is a doubling of ad recall versus traditional promoted tweets. Marketers that moved into video also saw almost a 30% lift in message association or ad association versus traditional promoted tweets and then lastly an 18% lift in awareness. So, ultimately, it’s helping drive all aspects of a marketer’s campaign and objectives and video is just performing much better.
Anthony Noto
Youssef, on your question as it relates to marketing initiatives, a couple of factors. The marketing initiatives that impacted the MAU growth are really about digital marketing, and it falls into three buckets: performance-based marketing, digital video ads as well as direct marketing. Starting in August of 2014, we started to build an internal team that could do digital and performance-based marketing at scale. We have solely built the expertise, the data and the learning. We really do that at very effective rate relative to lifetime value. And so that’s what we are referring to when we say marketing initiatives. As it relates to the MAU guidance, there is not much other color for me to provide you other than in the past quarter, there have been some type of underlying trend that was unusual that we needed to point out and we are just saying there is not an unusual underlying trend that was necessary for us to point out for this quarter.
Youssef Squali
Alright, thank you very much.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And the next question comes from the line of Brian Pitz at Jefferies.
Brian Pitz
Thanks for the question. Earlier this month, two new board members were appointed. I think Jack also hinted that there are more additions to come soon. Any color on what other skill sets you are looking forward to complete the team or any insights on what you are looking for? Thanks.
Jack Dorsey
Thanks for the question, Brian. We are continuing to look for public company experience for our global international policy experience, media experience, more of the voice of the person on the platform that we find so that we can continue to build the right products and get the right guidance and perspective from the board. And we are continuing to look for more diversity on our board as well.
Brian Pitz
Great, thanks.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And the next question we will take is from Twitter, it comes from the Twitter account of Neil Doshi. And he asks can you discuss the SMB opportunity? How is traction? And what are some of the challenges?
Adam Bain
Sure. On the SMB side, we were up on a year-on-year basis overall in active advertisers and it was driven by our SMB initiatives. SMB for us is an exciting opportunity because we have identified close to 9 million businesses who have setup shop on Twitter and are using it organically. Our goal is to move those 9 million businesses through the funnel to become active advertisers on the platform. As we think about sort of the road ahead in SMB, we see the SMB efforts mirroring our efforts in direct response. As we have seen so far, a lot of the spend from our SMB customers are into things like our website card objectives or DR objectives. So, as we make improvements through targeting measurement and also exposing those DR advertisers to Twitter’s total audience we think the SMB business will grow right along with it.
Krista Bessinger
Great, thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Ken Sena at Evercore.
Ken Sena
Thank you. You showed a nice EBITDA leverage in the quarter, but I noticed that overall R&D spend is down about 8% year-on-year. So, just given the size of the opportunities that you cite in the letter and the investments that are being made by your competitors, do you feel you are investing enough? And then we may have missed it, but we didn’t see an off network revenue or TAC disclosure. And so maybe you could provide that as well? That would be great. Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Sure. I will take the second question first. Our TAC was up 57% and that will be provided in the detailed disclosures that are available on our IR website. As it relates to R&D expense, we went through a restructuring last year to right-size the organization so we could focus on delivering the product roadmap that the team has built. We feel like we have the right organization behind that. We are always looking for great talent and retaining great talent and we will continue to focus on that. Interestingly enough, despite the change in R&D expense, on the number of software projects that are being worked on in the first quarter of this year that were started, doubled relative to what they were in the fourth quarter. And in the third quarter, we had very few because we are in the transition time period. So, we have a very sizable engineering product and design team. The work is focused on our product roadmap. It’s a great alignment. And that’s best reflecting the fact we had such an increase in software development projects in Q1.
Ken Sena
Great, thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And the next question comes from the line of John Blackledge at Cowen.
John Blackledge
Great, thanks. Two questions. For the DoubleClick partnerships, will either the DCM or DBM pieces be out of beta in 2016 or are we looking at kind of a 2017 event at this point? And then the second question will be have you said what percent of ad revenue is traditional promoted tweets? And what was the rate of change for that ad revenue on a year-over-year basis in 1Q? Thank you.
Adam Bain
Yes. So, on the DoubleClick side, DCM is in beta right now. As I mentioned, we have expanded it beyond a dozen clients and 100 campaigns. We are going to continue to expand the beta out, but we are going to watch the cross-device measurement piece very carefully as I mentioned. For us, what we want to make sure when a marketer, especially direct response marketer runs with us through DCM is that they fully understand that their mobile impressions that they are running on Twitter, of which 90% usually of their impressions are on mobile. We will map to the conversions and they are able to do the math correctly to get to the conversion number. On the DBM side, engineering is happening right now to get the DBM pipes in place. So, we anticipate a beta of that in Q3. And then as marketers see good ROI, we will open it up from there.
Anthony Noto
As it relates to the legacy promoted tweet both revenue in terms of year-over-year growth rate, what I would say is it’s still a very valuable format for advertising partners. It’s just becoming – their spending is becoming more diversified and we are seeing a move away from that to these higher performing auto-play video ads, which are equally valuable. And so there is a little bit of a mix shift. But that overall pie is under pressure and it’s still a sizable piece of our revenue. And to Adam’s point, we are excited about the product roadmap we have on the revenue product side. We hope to see that deliver over the course of the year, but that one legacy promoted pie is under pressure.
John Blackledge
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And the next question we will take is from Twitter. It comes from the account of Rich Greenfield. And he asks, your strategy and focus is really centered on live, how does Facebook’s desire to own live impact Twitter?
Jack Dorsey
Thanks, Rich. We have been doing live for 10 years and we have – we believe we have a leadership potential in it. We have a leadership position in it, but it’s not just about showing a live event, it’s also about hosting a conversation around the live event. Twitter has always been the best place to see what’s happening immediately to see what’s happening instantly and to bring people together around a particular shared experience. And as we talked about last time, we think the easiest way to get what Twitter is, is really to show a live event, show people the great accounts who are providing insights that you can’t find anywhere else, you can’t find in your address, but you actually meet on Twitter through that experience, to connect them through a follow and also to encourage them in a conversation. And that is exactly what we are focused on making sure that we continue to do. Because we are public and because we are distributed and because we are simple, we are the fastest way to see that event, but it also can go everywhere. So, can we say 100 million audience that we continue to grow and continue to focus on and then we are working on making sure that we have the best experience out there and using technology appropriately to increase that experience and the enjoyment of the experience. So, Periscope is a great example of this where we think we do have a significant leadership position in live streaming video and we want to make sure that is the best, not only for broadcasters, but for their fans and the fan base that watch those Periscopes.
Krista Bessinger
And so the next question comes from the line of Mark May at Citigroup.
Mark May
Thanks. I just had one quick question. Regarding your comments in the letter that you saw softness during the quarter from some of the large brand advertisers, would you say that, that is kind of a reflection of what’s happening at the macro level or it’s more company-specific, for instance, related to their promoted tweets transition that you have referenced? Thanks.
Adam Bain
Yes. I think for us it really is around this transition from traditional legacy brand promoted tweets into promoted video. Essentially, what we see the advertisers doing is testing into these higher performing units. They haven’t grown the spend yet. We believe that new budget will be added when some of the other features that we have in place that I talked about like the GRP buying or some of the demographic targeting and verification. In terms of the economy, I talked a little bit about it.
Anthony Noto
What I would add to that is obviously we want to see all of our peers report and see ultimately where the results are. When we look at our top 10 vertical categories, QSR, quick serve restaurants, as well as retail were two categories that performed decidedly lower than the rest of the overall business, which are macro driven categories. So to the extent it impacted everyone, we will have to wait and can see, but that’s the only evidence that we have in our results.
Mark May
Thanks Adam. Thanks Anthony.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And the next question comes from the line of Ron Josey at JMP Securities.
Ron Josey
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I think you mentioned Jack, that post-NFL announcement, other leagues and live events reached out, you all, I was just wondering, can you talk about how Twitter’s viewing sponsored content versus promoting the content that users are generating via Moments and other tools? Thank you.
Adam Bain
Sure. Why don’t I hop in there, I am not exactly sure what you mean by sponsored content. We obviously have an ad model that monetizes incredibly well, it works seamlessly with the lives sports, live politics and news as well as a live entertainment product, both in the format that we already have as well as auto-play video. And so the opportunity to create economic value for our partners really falls into a few buckets. First, we can help them reach a younger audience that’s hard to reach. A large percentage of our users are the millennial demographic. We can reach a global audience and we can reach a mobile audience and really extend their reach. We can also help drive tune into those that do have linear television and are away from home who are not aware of the programming being on. And then of course, we can also help them generate more revenue most directly and indirectly and that value proposition, in addition to the things that Jack talked about in terms of interest graph and knowing who is actually interested in that content specifically because they are following those types of accounts and looking at that specific type of tweet is really powerful for us to deliver them a complete solution.
Jack Dorsey
And Ron one other thing I would mention is in terms of overall sponsored video content, we had another successful quarter of Amplify. We now are over 300 Amplify video partners, so this is premium video content that partners are bringing on the platforms, sometimes exclusively on to Twitter. And it’s available now in 25 countries, so truly a global offering. Overall, we have ran hundred of – hundreds of campaigns in the quarter and we saw great campaigns around March Madness, the Grammys and Super Bowl. As we think about the year ahead, certainly there is a bunch of interesting events coming up, but there is also a bunch of always on opportunity for Amplify partners to speak directly to their audiences and then also to create a win-win with them for monetization.
Ron Josey
Thanks.
Krista Bessinger
Okay. We will take the next two questions together. They are actually one from Periscope, one from Twitter from the account of tmcmill81, but they are very related, so question from Periscope is, are you guys planning any acquisitions all of Periscope. And the question from Twitter is around plans to use the $3.5 billion in cash?
Jack Dorsey
Sure, they are definitely related. The first point I would make is that acquisitions have been critical in creating value for the Internet sector, consumer Internet sector over the last two decades. Many of our competitive peers have bought assets at very early stages that have resulted in billions of dollars of value and Twitter has been the same. The acquisition of Vine, the acquisition of Periscope, of Fabric are foundational acquisitions that are allowing us to create value for shareholders both now and into the future. And so the fact that we have the amount of cash on our balance sheet, over $3.5 billion leaves us with strategic optionality to look for those assets that are game changing the way Periscope is and the way Fabric is as well as some of our other acquisitions. And we are focused not just on consumer capture devices, but we are also focusing on other opportunities that have scaled audience to leverage our great monetization vehicle. And we are also focused on ad technology to continue build out our ad text stock. At end of the day, our goal is to be a one-stop shop for advertising. And having both owned and operated inventory, third party inventory and ad text stock that can serve both of those constituencies is really critical.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler at Raymond James.
Aaron Kessler
Yes. Thanks guys. A couple of questions, first can you just give us an update on the logged out user monetization I believe that was in beta last quarters, is that still on beta, what’s the performance there and maybe timing taking that out of beta. And just if you can provide an update on the kind of the UI changes that we – in terms of fixing that broken parts you referred to last quarter made specific right to ad names impacts at reply as well? Thank you.
Jack Dorsey
Yes. Aaron I will take the first part, which is around logged out monetization update. We continue to expand the beta across Q1. We are encouraged by the performance. When you look at cost per click rates, for example, one of the DR objectives that we have, CPCs are nearly identical for logged in and logged out from the sustained basis across the quarter, which is a good indication from advertisers that they are seeing good value from logged out experiences. In order to make that opportunity or realize that opportunity, we realize that we need to invest more to increase the amount of logged out impressions and overall scale of the offering.
Adam Bain
And on the broken windows and user expense in particular, we are looking a lot at conversations. Conversations is a huge part of the platform and that’s where a lot of the confusing aspects of Twitter are that we know is inhibiting more usage. And you should expect a see a lot more updates the conversation modules over this year. And we are really excited to push them up because clarify a whole lot. And we are making conversation on the platform a lot easier, a lot more expressive as well. We focused a lot of our energy recently on the onboarding experience and we have seen some pretty meaningful gains here. We saw over 48% increase in follows and 56% increase in mutual follows. Mutual follows are really, really important to retention because you are getting that constant feedback and you can have conversation on platform around it. So what we are doing around onboarding into the flow is working and we are going to continue to strengthen that.
Aaron Kessler
Okay. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thank you. And we have time for just one question. The question comes from the line of James Lee at CLSA.
James Lee
Great. Thanks for taking my question. This question is for Adam specifically, with video ads ramping, I assume age and gender targeting will become more important, I was wondering how do you address that challenge when you login data is a little bit more implicit. And just give us how accurate you are in terms of predicting both factors. And also on video advertising Adam, how much of your TV video campaign right now is companion to TV versus standalone on your platform? Thanks.
Adam Bain
So on the first one, in terms of video, to do age and gender, we do ask Twitter users now to input their birthday. There is a special feature on the platform where they get birthday balloons. That data has been useful in terms of targeting gender. We actually are highly predictive on the user’s gender which is based on the accounts they follow and some other features set. What we are working on in terms of video is making sure that our data asset matches the validation services like Nielsen’s DAR. And on the second one, is that a question more about our consumer marketing or some other thing?
James Lee
No, it’s more on video advertising, when you talked advertisers in general, are they doing parallel campaigns on their TV and also on your platform at the same time, so you have the companion platform or is it just the standalone platform? Thanks.
Adam Bain
Yes, great question James. Yes, we are seeing marketers line up campaigns together. This has historically been an opportunity for us in general. What’s interesting though is, we still see a ton of underperforming display advertising out in the world. And so what we see happening is money is moving out of display advertising, traditional display advertising into categories like this. And so marketers ultimately are lining up their Twitter spend with their TV spend. Essentially what we have done now is, we have proven that we already know there is great Twitter ROI when you do that, but there is also now proven great TV ROI. And we have done a bunch of research across multiple categories, whether it would be auto or consumer packaged goods, to show when advertisers lineup their buys in that way, it actually lead to in some cases over a 10% lift in their TV ROI.
Jack Dorsey
Alright, that’s all for now. Thank you all for joining us and really look forward to talking with you next quarter.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger
Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings Periscope. We have with us today are Executive Chairman, Omid Kordestani; CEO, Jack Dorsey; COO, Adam Bain; and CFO, Anthony Noto.
As we announced last week, we’re changing the format for our earnings presentation. In response to investor feedback today and going forward, we’ll publish a letter to shareholders on our Investor Relations website shortly after the markets close. Then we’ll begin with just a few prepared remarks before opening the call directly to your questions. I hope that this new format will result in greater clarity and additional time for Q&A So that our analysts, investors, and shareholders can really drive the conversation.
During the Q&A, we will take questions asked via Periscope and Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Question submitted via Twitter should be directed to at TwitterIR using the #TWTR.
We would also like to remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call, such as our outlook for Q1 and 2016, our expectations for user growth, and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today’s date, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures will be provided in the shareholder letter on our Investor Relations website. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results.
And finally, this call in its entirety is being broadcast over Periscope and being webcast on our Investor Relations website. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey
Thank you, Krista, and thank you, everyone, for joining. Before we get into questions, I wanted to highlight a few things from our shareholders letter. In our shareholder letter we talk in detail about the strength of our overall business, our financial performance, our outlook and that monthly active usage in January has bounced back to Q3 levels.
We’re confident that with disciplined execution, this growth trend in active usage will continue over time. We spent the last six months structuring the organization and our leadership team to move with greater agility and focus, reviewing the state of our service and strategy, learning from what we’ve shipped, and developing a stronger point of view about what we are and what we want to be.
In January, we gathered our entire global leadership team to align and commit to a plan for 2016. We’re focused now on what Twitter does best live. Twitter is live, live commentary, live conversations, and live connections, whether it’s breaking news, entertainment, sports, or everyday topics, hearing about and watching a live event unfold is the fastest way to understand the power of Twitter.
Twitter has always been considered a second screen for what’s happening in the world. And we believe we can become the first screen for everything that’s happening right now. And by doing so, we believe we can build the planet’s largest daily connected audience. A connected audience is one that watches together, and can talk with one another in real-time. That’s what twitter is provided for close to 10 years now, and it’s what we will continue to drive in the future.
We have five priorities in 2016 to serve this focus. Number one, we’re going to refine our core service and make everything more intuitive. Number two, we’re going to invest in being a leader in live streaming video, filming off our lead with Periscope. Three, we’re going to give creators and influencers, the best tools to build and connect with our audiences. Four, we’re going to invest in making Twitter safer, so everyone can feel more empowered to speak freely.
And finally fifth, we will support developers to build and grow their businesses with Twitter. Each is critical to strengthening our platform and audience around live. I want to invite Omid to talk to share few thoughts over them.
Omid Kordestani
Thanks, Jack. Hi, everyone, and thanks again for joining us. Before the leadership team takes questions, I want to share a few high-level observations. Twitter is a mission-driven company with an iconic product. When something happens in the world, it happens on Twitter. This makes Twitter an incredibly important service to the world. We built a strong revenue engine around that and we think there’s a tremendous potential ahead.
In my experience success does not come from short-term actions, but rather from consistent long-term product innovations. This is true of all the most successful companies in our space and you should expect it from Twitter as well. Our work will take time and through steady focus and disciplined execution, we will ultimately create the highest long-term value for our shareholders.
I’m excited to be here at this important juncture in Twitter’s history, and I’m committed to helping Jack and the leadership team achieve their vision to have my full faith and support.
With that, let me turn it over to Krista to kick-off questions with the leadership team.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you, Omid. Abigail [ph] we’re ready to go ahead and poll for questions please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Graham with Canaccord. Your line is open.
Michael Graham
Hi, thanks a lot. Just two questions, please. One on the comment about returning to MAU growth. Could you just put a little more color around that and maybe talk about whether you’re seeing better performance on the top of the funnel, or in conversion? And then just had a question on Periscope, it seems like it has a ton of potential. It seems like two big factors that you need to get right are latency and the density of broadcasters. I’m just wondering how you’re thinking about scaling both of those? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Sure. Mike, it’s Anthony Noto. Thanks for your question on MAUs in January. The rebound that Jack referenced is really due to three important components. We see – we’re seeing an increase in new users to the top of the funnel. We’re also seeing an increase in resurrected users to the top of the funnel. And we’re seeing a continued improvement in retention within the funnel, so all three are working for us. And so we’re very pleased with that.
The first quarter is a seasonally strong quarter. There’s typically more opportunity to drive organic growth. There are more events that are unique to Twitter’s strength and opportunity for us to really capture those new users and resurrected users and that’s what’s occurring in the quarter, so we’re quite pleased with that.
Jack Dorsey
On the Periscope side, we are investing heavily in this technology and the team is working really hard to build a full stack around video to continue to scale that. We had a major release just recently when we announced that anyone who could see a – anyone could see a Periscope in a tweet and stream live from a tweet. So any broadcaster could open their phone, start broadcasting, and anyone with Twitter who can visualize the tweet could actually see their broadcast live as well. So the distribution platform and the strategy around live continues to unfold and we will continue to build full stack technology to make sure that scales and increase the density of the experience.
Michael Graham
Okay. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. And the next question comes from Ross Sandler at Deutsche Bank. Ross, please go ahead.
Ross Sandler
A lot of thanks. I had one for Jack, and then one for either Anthony or Adam. So, Jack, in the shareholder letter you mentioned that the algorithmic timeline improvements that you announced this morning have increased usage across the board. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that comment? And do you expect overall usage and engagement to improve above what Anthony decided as of the end of January?
And then the question on Ad revenue for either Anthony or Adam. So the O&O Ad revenue was up about 37% ex-FX in the fourth quarter. And if we look at your first quarter guidance, it implies a little bit of a step down to probably the high – mid to high 20s, if we’re doing the math correctly. So, I guess, first questions is that accurate? And then we know you’re not guiding to 2016, but should we expect that type of a trajectory for O&O, as we get through 2016? Thanks.
Jack Dorsey
Thank you for the question, Ross. We saw some really promising growth with the test of the timeline that we just announced this morning is rolling out today for everyone to try out. We’re really excited about this, because it does improve the experience fundamentally.
So when you come back to the app, you can see all the best tweets from the people that you follow right there. And also balances that sense of live and that sense of recency. So pull to refresh and you get right back to us. So we see an increase in metrics even such as tweeting and retweeting, so pretty phenomenal, and continues to show that we need to continue to invest in our core around the timeline specifically.
So, as we make this better and better for people, as we continue to make it more real-time, more live, and also notice their usage patterns around them. Coming back to the app, what did I miss, I want to catch up the live as quickly as possible, and then we have seen likes and also replies and conversation go up as well. So pretty much every metric across the Board has improved by just focusing on the timeline. And as we noted in the shareholders letter, we think there’s a lot of opportunity in our product to fix some broken windows and some confusing aspects of our service that we know are inhibiting growth and timeline is a big focus area for that.
Anthony Noto
Ross, as it relates to our first quarter guidance, as you saw in the fourth quarter, our total revenue growth was faster than our owned and operated revenue growth. We expect that same relationship to continue into Q1. Our Q1 total revenue guidance though just to be clear for everyone on the call is 36% to 40% year-over-year growth. And we would expect relationship between owned and operated revenue in Q1 on a year-over-year basis to be less than that just as it was in the fourth quarter.
Krista Bessinger
Okay. We’ll take the next question from Anthony DiClemente at Nomura. Anthony, please go head.
Anthony DiClemente
Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have one for Jack, and then one for Anthony or Adam. Jack, is – with the recent restructuring of your leadership team, it appears from us on the outside looking into us that the Twitter leadership has until recently been in a state of flux. So I wonder if you could help us and talk about the reasons for the restructuring of leadership? And do you think that post these recent changes that the leadership team at this point is at a point of stability?
And then I also want to ask about engagement with the Twitter 5.0. You haven’t given any engagement metric specifically in recent quarters. But user conversations around live events is really where Twitter is supposed to be the most relevant. And using the Super Bowl as a barometer, tweets were down versus last year. I wonder if you guys could just talk about what you’re seeing in terms of engagement with the platform?
And you mentioned in the letter higher Ad loads year-over-year and sequentially, I wonder, Anthony, have you seen any impact on engagement from those higher Ad loads? Thank you very much.
Jack Dorsey
Thank you, Anthony, for the question. I’ll start with the organization. So 2016 is definitively going to be a year of additions. My primary focus is on recruiting. And recruiting more to our leadership team, we’ve had some major wins with Omid joining our company and Leslie our CMO. Around the restructuring of the leadership team, we’ve been thinking about this for a lot and looking for opportunities to consolidate some strengths in areas around the company.
Marketing is an obvious one. Revenue product and engineering and design is another big one under Adam and the media team. But the biggest shift has been around consumer engineering products and design. And we put all of that under Adam Messinger, our CTO. And there’s a few reasons why Adam has had a lot of context for the company. He is a true technologist. He’s had a good sense of what’s happened in the company, has a good learning from how we’ve organized, and how we’ve structured, and how we’ve reiterated. And his number one focus is to make sure that we achieve collaboration between those three organizations, so that we can move much faster.
Now that we have this greater focus on live and these five areas that we really want to continue to push week over week over week. We think we can move a whole lot faster with that agility, with that urgency that we need. So I do want to continue to recruit members under him. A big focus is product leadership, and on the PM team and also engineering technical leadership on that team as well.
So this structure is new for the company. It does consolidate a lot of different organizations that have been spread out and we think we’re going to benefit in terms of ship times and also a cadence of releases.
Anthony Noto
And then on your engagement question, I’ll hit on a couple of important engagement metrics. The one engagement metric that we look at sort of holistically is daily active users. And importantly, in the fourth quarter, our daily active users were flat sequentially to the third quarter and we see stability in January as well referencing our earlier comments about January trends.
A couple of other engagement metrics that we’ll share with you, because we’ve seen a lot of controversy around them in written reports. Time on site is not a metric that we look at or time spent holistically for the overall service. It does apply directly to video, as you mentioned. And our time spent is actually up on a year-over-year basis, both in aggregate on our per-user basis.
Additionally, the number of searches are up year-over-year in double-digits. The number of DMs were up on a year-over-year basis as well. So the key engagement metrics that we’re looking at continue to be positive. And that we want to make sure that you have a broader perspective given the controversy that we’ve seen around it.
Anthony DiClemente
Okay, thanks. On the ad loads, Anthony, just in terms of ad loads impacting engagement, what would you say about that?
Anthony Noto
Sure, ad load has increased meaningfully since the beginning of the year. And it’s been driven by international ad load increasing more than domestic ad load. Our domestic ad load has also increased. That said, while we have increased ad load, we’ve increased it, because of demand. We’ve benefited from tremendous growth in a number of advertisers and spend per advertiser throughout 2015.
In the most recent quarter, we’ve reached 130,000 advertisers, up 90% year-over-year, which is a great growth rate at that level of scale. And so that’s what’s driven the ad load increase. I think the other important point I would make, jeez, we still have headroom and what we think we can do as it relates to ad load and being able to achieve our growth expectations at this point.
Anthony DiClemente
Thanks a lot.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thank you. And we’ll take our next question from Twitter, it comes from the Twitter account of Vic Anthony – Victor Anthony. And he asked since the marketing initiatives were successful, should we assume that you will accelerate those initiatives in 2016?
Jack Dorsey
We’re very pleased with the impact that marketing had on the business in the fourth quarter. And more importantly, what we learned in applying that into 2016, as Leslie takes over the reins for us as our new CMO. We couldn’t be more excited to have her on the team and the expertise that she brings with the experience from American Express.
We’ve learned two important things in the fourth quarter. It was the first time we had an integrated campaign across both television advertising, as well as performance-based advertising. On the television advertising side of the equation, that has a longer impact, but we were able to really deliver a very clear messages that moments was a new way for people to use Twitter and to get the best of Twitter in instant.
On the performance-based marketing side of the equation, performance-based marketing, as we noted in the shareholder letter did contributing meaningfully in the fourth quarter. What I would also point out is that the cost of acquisition or the cost of reactivation was well below lifetime value calculations, and so that was a net positive.
I think more interestingly and quite surprising to us, but a very positive that we will expect to continue in the future is that, the retention rate of those users that we either resurrected or we acquired new was strong. And, in fact, new MAUs acquired through marketing efforts were performing better from a retention rate standpoint versus new organic MUAs acquired.
So we will continue to integrate marketing into our strategy. It’s an important element of what we talked about. We’re going to simplify the product, but we also have to clearly communicate its value. Marketing will play that role. As we go into 2016, we will gauge our level of spending based on the opportunity in front of us, and what we’ve learned. So it would be a prudent investment without over indexing on putting too much into the business and our margins that we’ve given you for 2016 reflect a balance between both investment and profitability.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks, Anthony. So our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Mark, can you go ahead.
Mark Mahaney
Thanks. Just so I understand the or we understand the shift in the MAUs kind of the slowdown in the fourth quarter and then the pickup back in January. Do you think that was all due to marketing, or were there any other product initiatives that may have explained both kind of a slowdown and then reacceleration? And then on Moments, I think there’s a little bit of a view that Moments has been an uninspiring or not that successful of a product launch. The view internally on how well Moments has done and whether there needs to be more iterations done on that product? Thank you.
Anthony Noto
So, Mark, I would answer your question both by referring to what happened in Q4 and then reiterating a couple of points about Q1. So Q4 historically has been our seasonally worst quarter and this Q4 was no exception to that. In addition to that seasonality at the top of the funnel, we did see a decrease in in resurrected users. That was a reflection both the seasonality as well as the fact that we made a conscious decision to reduce the volume of e-mails that we sent to dormant users to increase the quality of the communication that we have with those users that we’re trying to bring back to the service.
Interestingly enough that trend offset some underlying positive trends that are now becoming evident in January. First, the number of new MAU acquired in Q4 actually grew sequentially. The retention rate in Q4 increased relative to Q3. And as I already mentioned marketing played a role in that, in addition to those other two elements. And DAUs were flat in the fourth quarter, which is a clear signal that the users that we lost from a MAU perspective are not as high quality, as our DAU since that number wasn’t impacted.
As we get into January, we see a continuation of new improving – resurrected improving and retention continue to improve in addition to marketing helping. But it’s important to know, our marketing spend in Q1 will be done meaningfully from a marketing spend in Q4 because of the time of year Q4 being seasonally strongest from a advertiser and demand opportunity standpoint.
So those are the factors. As it relates specifically to product, we’ve made numerous product changes throughout the last 12 months. And that continuous improvement in product changes improves the experience someone gets when they come back to the product. And so over time, we retain more of those users and we have a chance to keep them on the platform longer.
And so ultimately, Q1 is a very good opportunity for us to capture some of the unique Moments around the Grammys and Super Bowl and some events that come like the Oscars and the Emmys. And as those things unfold, we get a chance to bring people back into the service and show them how much has improved. So there is not one product initiative that I’d point to, it’s just the fact that we’re constantly improving the product and when they come back we have an opportunity to keep them.
Jack Dorsey
And Mark on Moments, Moments is proven to be a fantastic way to tell a story. This is a collection of tweets in chronological order. We are seeing a lot of positive activity with Moments in the timeline and people tweeting Moments. When a Moments is in a tweet, it’s opened with higher than average click-through, which is really awesome. So we want to focus a whole lot more energy on enabling people to tweet out Moments, but also more people to create these Moments as well. But it all goes back to that focus on the timeline and making the timeline better and better and better and better.
On the Moments tab specifically and the guide, we think we can do a lot more work there, and there’s more ahead to make that a better experience. But we do want to focus a whole lot more on the tweets and the timeline and the intersection with Moments as well.
Mark Mahaney
Thanks, Jack. Thanks, An.
Anthony Noto
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. And our next question comes from James Cakmak at Monness Crespi Hardt.
James Cakmak
Hi, thanks. Jack, just one high-level question on Twitter’s identity please. So in the prepared commentary you stated the focus is around live, which is consistent with, I think how it was perceived today, but in the investment community there’s a consequence, what Twitter – how Twitter fits into the ecosystem versus your peers. Now, I use it for keeping up with the news, but when you think about how to communicate that value to a global audience and considering that you have several used cases for it.
I’m just curious how do you see the broader definition of Twitter’s identity? Is it social media, messaging, a lead generation tool, and those are parts of it. But when you consider that a user’s time is finite and they are making trade-offs and how they spend their time, how do you want that value to be perceived, so you actually get signups in bigger numbers, and how do you plan to communicate that value proposition in a way that resonates that it hasn’t before? Thank you.
Jack Dorsey
Thank you for the question. It’s a great question. So one of the things that we – as we said, we really want to focus on live, because we think it’s the fastest and easiest way to understand the power of Twitter and get into it. And once you see an event unfold on Twitter, there’s a real sense of electricity. There’s a real sense of being real-time, being in the now, being in the know about everything that’s happening. And then you start getting into more of the stronger, stickier value propositions for the service, which as you mentioned are around messaging. People are having conversations in the public with people all over the world.
First, around these live events. And then they make these connections in real-time around these events, and they persist. And we want to make that a whole lot easier. So when I say live, I mean, that live commentary, that live commentary around finance, around sports, around the protest, around a natural disaster, we see it every single day around a meme. Then we see all these live connections happen and they turn into conversations.
So we really want to focus on making that feeling really, really strong, enabling people to get into a much, much faster, because we just think it’s such a clarifying way to consider Twitter, and then you really brought into the broader ecosystem. So you’re right. It does go back to those fundamentals of Twitter is – starts with live. It’s powerful, because it’s public. It’s powerful, because and sticky because of the conversations and the connections that emerge. And then it can be everywhere, because it’s distributed. And all that adds up trusting the fastest, that allows us to break news 10 to 15 minutes before any other service, because of those four powerful aspects of the service.
So our focus is really what’s the most meaningful guide path into the experience and then what really continues to engage people? And we think that’s around conversation and onto the next live event.
James Cakmak
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. So the next question comes from Twitter and it comes from the Twitter account of Jason Moser. And he asks with two major events this year; with the Olympics and the election, how are you approaching them? Do you see any opportunities for interesting partnerships or strategies?
Adam Bain
Hey, Jason, it’s Adam. I’ll take that one. Well we’re not going to quantify the lift that we’re going to see from the Olympics and the elections, really excited about the opportunity, both on the content side and then certainly what’s going to be available for marketers. On the content side, we now have a massive audience and a massive amount of engagement around video, in particular, that also has translated to marketer activity.
This is activity that the last – last elections and the last Olympics did not exist, especially these ad products. So whether it’s video to drive persuasion budgets and the elections or video to drive television budgets to correspond with TV budgets that run on the Olympics, we’re going to be in a really good position. Marketers also have a way to bring their tailored audiences, so their CRM data to the platform to also drive targeting.
And we thought even this past weekend during the Super Bowl, it was an exciting day for marketers even if the game wasn’t that exciting. 90% of the advertisers that ran on TV also ran on Twitter, and over half of that budget that they ran actually was dedicated towards video. And we saw the event be home to really incredible creative executions, I’ll talk about a couple of these.
Doritos went live from Levi Stadium in the middle of the game to promote their new Doritos brand on Periscope. And they also promoted it as a promoted Tweet with the Periscope. This is a feature that we’ve launched in pilot this week, and they were the first marketer to test that.
We also saw a great content that came to platform. Beats, for example, debut their new commercial on Twitter first, so did Disney Marvel as well. So we think ultimately these events are great from a content experience for consumers and then certainly the very powerful for marketers.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan at UBS. Eric, please go ahead.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking my questions. I just have two on the advertising business maybe for Adam, with respect to the relationship with DoubleClick, I appreciate all the color around the advertising business. You also said you’re very optimistic about DoubleClick Campaign Manager and the DoubleClick Bid Managers who move into 2016. Can you help us understand a little bit better about how those will evolve those relationships what that might mean for the advertising business going forward and how it will play out in a little more detail through 2016?
And then maybe one follow-up would be, what percentage of Ad business now is via self-service? And as that evolves to more self-serve over time, what that might do for margins in the business? Thank you.
Adam Bain
Yes, great. So on the first question on DoubleClick, as we mentioned in the last earnings call, we started our pilot in Q4 with DoubleClick and this is around the measurement part of DoubleClick – a DoubleClick Campaign Manager or DCM. That pilot started at the end of Q4 and runs to the very end of Q1, so we’re going to have more information at the end of the quarter on how those tests went.
But what I can tell you it’s very early, but there’s encouraging signs based on the early set of tests that are running with DCM. And ultimately, DCM is important, because it’s going to allow us to show a real apples-to-apples comparison of how Twitter performs versus the marketers rest of their media mix.
And then on the other side of the equation is DBM, DoubleClick Bid Manager or the buying arm of DoubleClick. And we’re excited about this opportunity, because there’s – we think we’re going to be exposed to new advertiser budgets and also new advertisers that primarily use DBM to drive their campaigns. We just started technical integration here in Q1 for the DBM, so more to come as soon as the technical integration is completed and we begin our pilots.
Anthony Noto
And then on the question as it relates to the percent of business that self-serve, our directs sales organization is still the largest percentage of our advertising from a channel perspective. From a margin perspective, the self-serve business has much higher margins. We love the margins of that business. We’re very happy with the margin expansion we’ve been able to achieve today. But as that business continues to grow as a percent of total, it will give us an additional margin benefit. So that will be a net positive.
Jack Dorsey
We’re excited about this. On the small business side of the self-serve platform, as Anthony mentioned, we went from a 100,000 active advertisers in Q3 to now over a 130,000 active advertisers in Q4. A lot of that growth was driven by the SMB channel. And ultimately, we’ve got a strong roadmap ahead to help prove to those SMBs and direct response marketers the efficacy of the ads they are running on Twitter.
Eric Sheridan
Great. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Doug, please go ahead.
Douglas Anmuth
Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, just wanted to ask about timeline and the new thing as you’re introducing. Can you just talk a little bit more about how they differ from While You Were Away, and how that is going to impact user experience and relationship to that previous kind of change that you implemented?
And then secondly, I would argue that there’s tremendous value in Twitter without having to Tweet. How can you better communicate that to potential users, and is that a big priority for you going forward?
Jack Dorsey
Absolutely, and thank you for the question. So we do have those focus around live, because we do think that’s the easiest way to explain more of the logged out audience experience around Twitter, the very easy way to see the value instantly, and we will continue to push our marketing efforts under Leslie now to make sure that we’re showing that value fast.
We have a lot of great events coming up in this quarter and also throughout this year. The election is always fantastic for us. I think you’re seeing that unfold on Twitter right now. Every single day there’s something new and that’s been consistent over nearly our 10 years, as a service as well. Election years are fantastic for us in terms of the public dialogue.
In terms of the timeline versus While You Were Away, While You Were Away is something that we launched about a year ago. And it is a fully ranked module that gives you a sense of the best tweets from folks you follow, but they’re not necessarily in reverse chron order, they’re in relevance order. With this new improvement of the timeline, which is something that people are going to be opt – be able to opt-in today by going to their settings.
We have learned a lot from that experience. We’ve applied a lot of the same algorithms to it, but they’re in reverse chronological, and there are a whole lot more recent as well. This activates when you open up your approximately. So when you’re away from your app for a bit, you have a quick recap that is recent, but as reversed chronological, you pull the refresh and you go right back to live and recent.
So one way to think about it is, it’s the fastest way to get back to live without missing any of those tweets that you really wanted to see. And this gives the Twitter also a superpower, because they don’t have to tweet multiple times to get one message across. It will likely be seen in the right way by the right person, by the right audience. So our job is to connect the audiences especially for these creators and for these influencers and for these conversation. And we’ve shown that this work can do that job very, very well.
So we’re really excited for people to see it, to feel it, to play with it, and continue to refine it, because more and more we see that all that time spend is in the timeline, and we think we have a significant opportunity to make that better and better, while still preserving what is core to Twitter, which is around that recency, that real-time and that live feeling.
Anthony Noto
And the question about marketing and being able to convey the value of consuming, we’re very focused obviously on creators and influencers was outlined in the shareholder letter. But to your specific question, we feel leverage is direct marketing and the log that experienced to deliver someone directly to the content that they may be interested in. And because we just launched logged out responsive web in 23 countries, we can now do that in mobile.
So we can market to them in e-mail. We can market to them on other sites about specific content and brining them directly to that content without them needing to log-in, per se, without them actually searching for the content. So it’s an important element of our overall strategy and we’ll make marketing more effective.
Jack Dorsey
And then communicating the value to marketers actually has been a pretty clear to marketers over the last quarter, as we’ve gone from essentially addressable audience of over 300 million to now an addressable audience from marketers of over 800 million.
In Q4, we began a pilot to run our promoted tweets, two logged out users. The pilot was with a small amount of marketers and was with two advertising units essentially our promoted video and one of the DR units, promoted website card. And what we found actually, we were pleased with. The click-through rates on – and the view rates on the logged out ads were nearly identical to logged in, and I’d recall was nearly identical to logged in as well.
And so we’re happy with the early tests that we’re seeing in terms of logout ads. Obviously, there’s more work to be done in terms of growing the amount of impressions that are there. But from a marketers perspective, the total addressable reach of Twitter got large – got very large in the quarter.
Douglas Anmuth
Great. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And we’re going to take the next question from Twitter, it comes from the account of Deborah Williamson. And she asks, how are direct response ad sales going? And our direct response advertising – advertisers finding value from Twitter?
Jack Dorsey
Thanks, Debbie. So we’re early in our direct response business. And this is a product driven growth line for us. The work that we’re doing actually is along three lines, which is one, increasing and making the creative canvas even better for direct response marketers. Two, to focus on the measurement piece of the equation. And then lastly, expose those marketers to our total audience. So talk about how we’re progressing along the lines in each one.
On the canvas side, increasing their creative canvas for direct response marketers. In Q4, we piloted a program with a handful of direct response marketers called dynamic product ads. And essentially what this does is, it allows us to bring remarketing creative, and remarketing budgets on the Twitter. We saw a two-time lift, the 2X lift in click-through rates for those ads. So we’re off to a good start. In Q1, we’re going to expand the pilot for DPAs.
In terms of measurement, in Q4, we launched conversion lift studies. We’re working on getting these now in the UI. But for conversion lift studies we are starting to prove to marketers – direct response marketers, the impact on a view or a click downstream conversion. What we’ve seen on average so far is that, if you view a promoted tweet on Twitter, you’re almost one-and-a-half times more likely to convert on the advertisers landing page. And if you click on the ad, you are more than three times likely to convert on the advertisers landing page. And obviously, we talked a little bit about our efforts with double-click in terms of getting further measurement in the direct response space.
And then lastly, direct response marketers care about scale and reach. And so we’ve started opening up and exposing those marketers to Twitter’s total audience, both in our logged out areas as I mentioned and then also on the Twitter audience platform. And in that platform, the marketer simply goes into the UI, clicks a button to extend, past be logged-out base and into a wider area of syndication. So we’re off to a very good start. We’re pleased with the progress we’re making, and we have confidence in the roadmap ahead for direct response.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. So our next question comes from Brian Wiser at Pivotal Research. Brian, please go ahead.
Brian Wiser
Well, thanks for taking the question. First, I was curious, if you could just clarify the EBITDA margins in your guidance. Is that as a percentage of gross revenue or revenue ex-TAC? Relatedly, why do you think it’s going to be stable this year versus perhaps expanding where are you prioritizing investments.
And lastly, just around the work you’ve done with TV networks and amplify. I was curious if you could update us on how that product is evolving? And given the folks on live, how you see the inner relationship between Twitter and other media owners going forward?
Anthony Noto
Thank you. In terms of the margins on our guidance for 2016 EBITDA, margins are on a gross basis and it’s 25% to 27%. We’re very pleased with the margin expansion that we’re able to achieve in 2015. We achieved 25% EBITDA margins on a gross basis up from 21% in 2014, on a net basis actually 27%. Importantly, we’re able to make a significant number of investments in 2015 and still drive that improved profitability, and it’s given us even more confidence, that we can achieve our long-term EBITDA margins of 40% to 45% on a net basis.
In 2016, we will have margin expansion based on the midpoint of our range. It’s not as much as we had in 2015, and that’s because we see a significant number of a growth opportunity in front of us. And we want to make sure that we’re investing in those growth opportunities to maximize the size of our audience over time, maximizes engagement, and ultimately drive the best business characteristics around it, so we can maximize shareholder value. We think it’s the right time to make those investments and ensure that we’re – we deliver the maximum value for you as shareholders. All that said, we’ll balance both growth versus profitability and hold ourselves to a very high bars and make those investments.
Jack Dorsey
Hey, Brian, on the amplify side, we now have over 225 amplify partners. These are premium video content providers we’re bringing content onto Twitter and it’s available now. These partners are in 25 countries all across the world. So it surely has moved global. This is important on a number of – for a number of reasons. One, for consumers on Twitter, it’s a great content experience, content that they probably wouldn’t otherwise have seen some of these content is actually exclusive to the platform. And two, it’s a great monetization opportunity and also a great storytelling platform for marketers.
Marketers who are running campaigns on Twitter, especially video centric narratives are looking to attach themselves to great highlights or other pieces of content, that might otherwise organically trend on the platform. We also are continuing our efforts to monetize that inventory hand-in-hand with those partners. This is a joint revenue a win-win in a joint revenue relationship between the partners.
Last thing I’d say is, as we’ve increased our work on the video side of the world, we also – it also has come hand-in-hand with telling a story to marketers about how their investment in Twitter not just helps their digital or Twitter ROI, but it also helps their TV ROI as well. In recent research and tests that we’ve done with marketers, we’ve shown TV – we can increase TV ROI from 8% to 16% when you simply just lineup advertising on Twitter to go hand-in-hand with your TV advertising. And we think there’s room for marketers to move budget out of underperforming display and into Twitter to do that.
Brian Wiser
Great. Thank you very much.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian at R.W. Baird. Colin, please go ahead.
Colin Sebastian
Great. Thanks, Krista. A couple of follow-ups. First off on ads targeting the logged-out audience. I was curious what level of demand you are seeing for these ads through the publisher network, given that many advertisers are seeing, they are very interested in finding greater skill and reach through the Twitter platform.
And then a follow-up on the margin question in anticipation of the growth initiatives your plan for the year ahead. I wonder what your expectations are for headcount, as we through the year, particularly on the engineering side? Thank you.
Adam Bain
Hey, Colin, it’s Adam. I’ll take the first one in terms of the demand that we’re seeing for logged-out. The demand is strong for logged-out, because obviously we’ve been talking to our marketer partners about the opportunity to get incremental reach on the platform. They’re very excited about it. Marketers love the storytelling platform and the results that they’ve been seeing on Twitter and they want to be able to scale it out to this wider audience.
It’s important to note for Q4 the pilot that we ran for logged-out was with just a handful of marketers and was only across two of our advertising objectives, as I mentioned, one of the DRI objectives and a video objective. So it’s just – it’s early yet in terms of jumping to any conclusions. But I can tell you I’m excited about what I’ve seen so far and also the demand that we’re seeing in the marketplace for it.
Anthony Noto
As it relates to margins and headcount or headcount expectations are baked into the margin guidance, I gave you, obviously that will be dependent on us being able to find the high-quality people that we’re looking for, but make no mistake about it. Our number one priority on headcount is engineers, product managers, and design. And so we’re focused on that area. We will have headcount growth in others areas, but that will be the largest area.
Colin Sebastian
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And we’re going to take our next question from Periscope. The question is how much of Jack’s time is split between Twitter and Square?
Jack Dorsey
Thank you for the question. So I have set up a structure that is working very well for me, so that I can spend meaningful time at both companies, and I have enough flexibility in the schedule. So that if there is something that needs more attention at one company, I can devote that attention, and I’m always connected to the leadership teams at both companies non-stop.
So we have a structure that allows me to see what’s happening in the week, we set off the week together at both companies and we have checkpoints. And then the balance of my time is really spent on recruiting, that is going to be the number one focus for me and that’s where we’re going to show a lot of momentum at Twitter is recruiting. As Anthony said, we’re looking for a whole lot more talent in the product areas and engineering and also in design.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And we’re going to double this from Periscope, we have one more. In terms of – to the extent that you’re looking to add people to the Board, what kinds of qualities and characteristics that you are looking for and why?
Jack Dorsey
We – that’s a great question. We’re looking to add to the Board and part of that recruiting effort is also to our Board. We’d like to move fast on this. And we are looking for a public company experience, significant financial experience, international policy experience, and also media experience. We want a Board that continues to represent the best of Twitter and can help us guide the company in the right way going forward, especially around this focus that we’re laying out before you today around live and these five focused areas.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. So our next question comes from Justin Post at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post
Great. I would like to ask one on the user side and one on the ad revenue side. So on the users, you have quite a bit of, I’m guessing, churned users. And maybe just talk about how large that base is and one of the one or two things you think it really click those things, I know you’re working on a ton of things, but are there one or two things where you really think that could bring those people back.
And then on the revenue side, definitely guiding to some deceleration, is that macro? Are you decreasing the rate of ad load growth, or is it just kind of large numbers a little bit on the revenue deceleration? Thanks.
Jack Dorsey
I’ll take a part of that – part of the first question. We do believe that in the core product, there’s just a number of broken windows that are confusing people and inhibiting a lot of growth. We do want to focus a lot of that energy on the timeline, as we can continue to on for onboard people in a way that instantly connects them with the interest or with their context, we see a whole lot more stickiness and usage.
So the focus is continued to show the world and show the world around these live events, find the best way to bring them in, in a very effortless and frictionless way, and then continue to connect them with context and over with interest that they want to follow and stay informed around, that that value proposition really works. We’re also going to pair this with marketing, but we continue to have a consideration of Twitter and Twitter making these live events better.
Anthony Noto
And the one thing I’d say about the users to add to what Jack said is our top of the funnel is quite large. And so one thing we benefit from and one thing we’re encouraged by every day is a number of new users that come to Twitter on a daily basis and the number of resurrected users that come on a daily basis, which present a great opportunity for us to really improve the experience for them and make them retained users.
As it relates to the revenue guide, Adam, I will tag team on that. Q1 is normally a seasonally weaker advertising quarter, last year we were down sequentially We’re forecasting down sequentially as well, because the demand is down sequentially, you would expect the load factor would also be down sequentially just to answer that specific part of it and…
Adam Bain
Yes, Justin, let me give you some better context overall around what we’re seeing in the business and what happened in Q4. We had a good Q4. We saw revenue over 50% on a constant currency basis. And when you’re looking inside of our advertising stream, there’s really two types of advertisers that are in the mix, and I want to talk about the trends in both.
On the branded advertisers side, this is the largest percentage of our revenue stream and since we’re covering many of those advertisers now and have been for a while since it’s our most mature business, the growth in revenue was going to come primarily in growing budget themselves. And as I think you know, in the ad business, branded advertisements are more measured in terms of how they add budget. At the same time, we just launched quarter-and-a-half ago, our video products and they are working. We are seeing now 33% of our managed clients actually use video as a tool overall.
So growth ultimately is going to come from these budgets. And ultimately in Q4, we were up on a quarter-on-quarter basis and a year-on-year basis double digits for branded advertisers in terms of ARPA.
Let me turn attention now over to the direct response side of the business. That’s actually faster growing, but it’s still the minority part of our revenue stream. Our growth in advertisers, as I mentioned before is coming from SMB marketers. And since this is a product driven roadmap and product driven growth, budgets will come ultimately as we continue to scale our results. And we are confident in the roadmap ahead that we’ve got in Q1 and beyond for measurement targeting and exposing of the scale.
Justin Post
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Great, thanks. And I think we have time for just one last question. So our last question comes from Mark May at Citigroup.
Mark May
Thank you. I think this is direct to Jack. Since you’ve taken over as CEO, you’ve changed some things that were kind of uniquely Twitter, 10,000 characters, this new add relevance or relevance space timeline. And just curious what do you think or some of the other elements of the service that might be inhibiting user growth and user engagement that you may be tweaking similarly going forward?
And then a question, there have been some recent reports that Twitter has been experimenting I’d say with changing maybe the ad load with certain timelines, particularly verified profiles and timelines. Can you talk a little bit about that and kind of what you’re attempting to do there? Thanks.
Jack Dorsey
Well, as I said, we are focusing a lot of our energy on refining the core products, and looking at what is confusing about the service. What is inhibiting growth? I mentioned a few of them in the letter, specifically around conversations. Why it was a great way to get in, but people want to talk about it and Twitter has always been phenomenal about that. We have some really weird rules around conversations specifically around replies and the start add name, format that just nobody understands and we just need to fix those things.
There’s a number of places in our on-boarding that are just not ideal, doesn’t really use great machine learning to connect people with people they already know or interest that we know that they might be interested in. So we’re going to do a lot of that work. We’re really focused on that first step around live and then getting people into that experience faster, so that we can connect people in real-time around these interest and really continue to push.
We do think that live streaming video is a great way to explain the service very quickly, and you’re going to see a whole lot more there. I was really excited about the integration into tweaks of Periscope streams, that’s been fantastic, because anyone with the Twitter app or visiting Twitter on the web, or anyone that is anywhere that a tweet can be displayed, you can see a live Periscope stream, which is awesome and really shows off the power of the service in that live, simple, conversational public aspect that we want to continue to, to double down on.
So we know of a number of confusing areas. We know of a number of refinements that we can make to help people who are both core to our platform, but also just getting on. And we think as we continue to push on those changes, they get deeper and deeper and deeper and more engaged.
Anthony Noto
Yes, Mark, the philosophy in terms of the ads part of the business, we focus on the consumer first and then the business ultimately will follow. We’ve learned one of the things I thought you brought up was around a verified users and ads verified users. I wouldn’t read anything into that. We do short-term and longer-term ad exposure experiments all the time on all of our audience segments and all of our tweeting segments to look for both exposure and also ultimately ROI changes for the marketer.
And then on the second piece, we just yesterday launched a new product for marketers called First View. This ultimately allows the marketer to make the very first impression, the first time that a consumer comes to Twitter. It’s important to know that while the product is – already has high demand, because it’s a reach in scale product. Ultimately, this is not more ads or more advertising in the timeline, it just is a targeting change for the first impression when that consumer comes in.
Mark May
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And that concludes Q&A. I’d like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Jack Dorsey
Thank you all for your time. And before we leave today, I just wanted to reinforce what we’re focused on delivering for the next year. At the center of everything is live. We have a relentless focus on making this experience great. And we think there are five areas that really make this sing and that is refining our core service, making a whole lot more intuitive, investing in live streaming video, because we think it’s a great complement through that live experience, giving creators and influencers the best tools and really honoring that investing and making Twitter safer, so that everyone feel safe to continue to express themselves on our platform and supporting developers. And we’ve structured the teams to do this and have all the right people in place to move forward. So thank you very much, and we look forward to sharing our progress over the year.

During the Q&A, we will take questions asked via Periscope and Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Question submitted via Twitter should be directed to at TwitterIR using the #TWTRearnings or the $TWTR.
We would also like to remind that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call, such as our outlook for Q4 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
Please also take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. Also note that the forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today’s date, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.

And with that, I’d like to go ahead and turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey
Thank you, Krista. And thank you all for joining on Periscope, on the web and on the phone. I am pleased to be joined by Anthony and also by Adam, who will be joining us on these calls going forward.
Looking at the quarter from a high level, we saw strong financial performance with $569 million in revenue and $142 million in EBITDA. We continue to grow the number of people who use Twitter, now totaling 320 million monthly active and 307 million excluding SMS Fast Followers.
Together with our logged out audience of over 500 million people, which is still growing sequentially, that’s over 800 million people who use Twitter owned and operated properties every single month, and that doesn't include the over 1 billion unique visits monthly to websites with embedded tweets.
As we’ve said on our last earnings call, our focus is on three things, a more disciplined execution, simplifying our services and better communicating our value. We have made meaningful progress across all three.
First, let's talk about our execution, we simplified our roadmap around a few big breaths across Twitter, Periscope and Vine that we believe represent our largest opportunities, assigned leads for each major project initiative and fully staffed those teams.
As part of this focus we made a decision to reduce our workforce by about 8%. While this decision was difficult, we strongly believe we can move faster with this new org structure and smaller nimbler teams.
Product engineering and design still represent our largest group and that’s important because as a technology company, our services power everything we do, and we are still hiring and investing in talent in ways that specifically serve our priorities. Having Adam take on a broader role as our COO will bring his attention not just on our business but across the entire company.
Lastly, we are thrilled that Omid Kordestani has joined us as Executive Chairman. Omid’s experience helping world-class teams grow and operate at scale is a tremendous asset for our Board, our leadership and our company.
Second, an update on our services, Twitter is getting easier to use every single week with a steady increase of launches. Since the last earnings call we’ve launched some great improvements.
Highlights on Android, which pushes you the most interesting tweets of the day tailored just for you, Polls a much easier way to gather opinions directly from a tweet, 21 new features for our mobile development platform fabric, including integration that let anyone use Amazon web services, Optimizely and Stripe without any additional work, new tools that help developers find, organize and syndicate tweets in mobile apps and websites, landscape view and web profiles for Periscope, which were two of our most requested features, music on Vine making seamless audio looping easy and fun, and lastly, Moments, the best of what's happening on Twitter in an instant.
Launched just after the end of the quarter, Moments is the simplest way to see what's happening in the world, all organized by topic. It’s early and we're still collecting feedback, but we've already seen how Moments improves Twitter. I want to share a few of the most interesting Moments we've seen so far.
The Toronto Blue Jays series clinching win over the Texas Rangers during the major league baseball playoffs, which showed not just the best plays and commentary, but also the passion of the Blue Jays fans after the go-ahead home run.
The Washington Post Paris Fashion Week Moment, putting people front row for all of the hottest designs of one of fashion biggest events. And Mashable's Moment of the South Carolina floods, which brought home in a very visceral way the extent of flood damage and how resident were coping.
You can find Moments in our app on twitter.com and embedded in sites all over the web. Our focus with Moments now is making them easier to discover, getting people into them right when they open Twitter and rolling out curation globally beyond the United States.
Moments is just the start of bolder simplification efforts you will see on Twitter. I’ve challenged our teams to look beyond assumptions about what makes Twitter the best play to share what's happening. I'm confident our ideas will result in the service that’s far easier to understand and much more powerful.
And finally, our focus on better communicating Twitter’s value, I am happy with the strides we are making here as well. We’ve begun an integrated marketing campaign in the United States around Moments that will rollout over the rest of the year and into 2016. In fact, you will see our TV ads tonight during the World Series.
We are also doing a better job of leveraging events that demonstrate Twitter’s value to our customers. We use last week’s Flight conference to reaffirm our support of the developer community and improve our tools for them. Our standing room only Video Now event for marketers earlier this month gave us a platform to show the richness of video on Twitter, Periscope and on Vine.
And finally, I've asked our General Counsel, Vijaya Gadde to take on responsibility for our communications team. She is pushing us to help tell great stories to the press and also use our own communication services more creatively and more proactively.
When amazing things happen in the world we see them right on Twitter, Periscope and on Vine. The last several months were no exception. With a single tweet in August, Germany's immigration office sent a message about their acceptance of refugees that reverberated throughout Syria and the Middle East. It created a wave of migration that was documented for all the world to see, live.
Pope Francis’ historic visit to the United States was chronicled through all of our platforms by everyone from congregants to the Pope himself. The Pope use of Twitter to create global dialogue even earned a shout-out from President Obama.
And the arrest of a Texas high schooler named Ahmed Mohamed sparked a worldwide dialogue around the hash tag I stand with Ahmed. We were so moved by his story that we offered him an internship.
And with that, let me hand it over to Adam with some additional comments on our business performance.
Adam Bain
Thanks, Jack. Hi, everyone. I am thrilled to be joining for my first Twitter earnings call and excited to be taking on my new role, working with Jack and Anthony to drive cross-functional alignment and execution at Twitter.
As Jack said, we had a strong Q3, with broad base strength across all verticals, channels and geographies, driven primarily by our strength with new video features. I am going to talk about those in detail in a few minutes.
But first I want to spend some time on our key advertising priorities and how we are executing against them. We have three main initiatives for ads business. One, building a rich canvas for marketers; two, driving marketer ROI with improved measurement, bidding and relevance; and three, increase scale by leveraging Twitter's unique total audience.
Let’s start with building a rich canvas for marketers and that starts with the growth of video. We lunched auto-play video on all devices midway through Q3 and the results have been terrific for people using Twitter and also for marketers.
The volume of video consumption on Twitter has grown dramatically over the last six months, with native video views up 150x across Twitter, Periscope and Vine. Now the entire ad industry has been engaged in a dialogue about high-quality video views, something that's lacking on most ad platforms.
In response we introduced the highest viewability standard in the industry only charging once an ad is 100% in view for at least three seconds. After introducing auto-play video marketer saw an 84% decrease in the cost per video views on Twitter.
And additionally, our marketers saw a 7x increase in the amount of video completion. So people aren’t just watching more video on Twitter, they're finding the content so compelling that they are watching the video all the way through to the end.
Now these results demonstrate how changes in our video ad features are helping marketers drive higher ROI. To continue scaling our video business, we need to continue to improve the cost per video view, we have a number of features and launches coming up over the next few quarters designed to do just that.
Along those lines, in Q4, we will be opening up new video focused inventory with the launch of Promoted Moments, available in the U.S. as a pilot for select advertisers it’s designed to be a great platform for marketers to tell their stories, especially video centric narratives.
Last weekend we launched the first Promoted Moments with MGM, Warner Bros. in partnership with their agency OMD for the movie Creed, where the studio was able to generate awareness and anticipation of the film by curating videos and tweets in a really compelling campaign.
For Q4, our goal with Promoted Moments will be to learn alongside marketers. Demand is strong, so we will be deliberate in our approach, with a limited series of Promoted Moments optimized for quality consumer experience above all else. To be clear as we test consumers will not see a Promoted Moments everyday.
Let me turn to our second advertising priority, which is driving advertiser ROI with improved measurement, bidding and relevance and we've made a number of improvements here in Q3. Let’s start with the bidding enhancements.
For performance marketers we continue to introduce and improve new optimization and bidding enhancements like, cost per install optimization and target cost per click bidding. With cost per install optimization we are now using install conversion data to make smarter recommendations about what mobile app download ad to show and the marketer only pays when the campaign drive the install, this model lower cost for marketers like 20% to 30% for our pilot customers.
With target cost per click bidding, advertisers can specify a target or an average bid rather than a max bid, meaning they see greater scale and more conversion at their desired cost per click.
Now in addition to the bidding work, in Q3 we also introduced the new targeting option called Event Targeting, to capitalize on the live nature of the platform. This form of targeting makes it really simple for our marketers to run an ad campaign around an event versus hand selecting all the individual keywords and interest to reach the right audience.
Mindshare U.K. has been using Event Targeting actively with the number of their clients and saw improvement in engagement rates with their ads ranging from 73% lift to 110% lift. In order to bring these types of results to even more marketers, we’re making investments in measurement and Ad relevance.
On the measurement side, Twitter expects to officially start a DoubleClick pilot at the end of Q4 to make measurement and attribution available for a small number of our joint customers.
Let me give you some background on why this is important. Our partnership with DoubleClick is specifically designed to address two main challenges. One, many third-party measurement systems were built back in the desktop era and have not accurately measured mobile inept activity. It is important as almost 90% of our revenue comes from mobile.
And two, existing measurement systems don't account for the powerful engagement actions on the tweet, actions like a retweet or follow and the corresponding impact on downstream conversion. Marketers know there's a link and they want to see it.
So our partnership with DoubleClick precisely addresses these two problems. Google and Twitter expect to stay in the pilot through the end of Q1 2016 to tune the offering an account for Twitter's unique features. Now, in addition to the measurement, we are also very focused on Ad relevance. And that's why in Q4, we will launch our dynamic ads retargeting pilot, the first instance of using the TellApart technology back on Twitter.
Let’s shift to Twitter’s total audience. Our third priority is increasing reach by leveraging Twitter's unique total audience. In Q3, we broaden the availability of our Ad syndication efforts so that marketers can with just a single click expand their campaigns from Twitter to a much broader audience. Through this program, marketers are able to use the same creative and the same targeting that they are used to one Twitter but expand their reach to a much wider audience of $700 million people.
That allows us to more directly compete for display at budget. As an example, JBL Audio use the Twitter audience platform to drive an additional 70% incremental reach on their campaign with us while achieving an engagement rate much higher than other display at ad platforms.
Now, in addition to these three parties that have outlined, I want to close by highlighting growth in the number of marketers using Twitter Ads. In Q3, we crossed over an important milestone of 100,000 active advertisers driven in part by our small business initiative.
After a major launch this past quarter, our SMB Ad platform is now open in over 200 market, giving small midsize businesses, a way to quickly promote campaign, give them access to tools like Tweet Analytics. In the quarters ahead, we have plans to increase businesses’ use of Twitter. We have identified close to 9 million SMBs already on Twitter. And it’s a key priority for us to provide them with more customized tools and services.
Now if we succeed in delivering on all three of these objectives, building originally the campus for marketers, driving ROI with improved management, bidding and relevant and increasing scale leveraging Twitter's unique total audience. We believe we’ll see steady increases in both our revenue per advertiser and the total number of marketers using Twitter.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Anthony to talk more about our Q3 performance and outlook for the remainder of the year.
Anthony Noto
Thank you Adam and good afternoon everyone. I’ll discuss our financial and operating performance for Q3 and provide guidance for Q4. Total revenue reached $569 million, an increase of 58% year-over-year and $9 million above the high end of our guidance range.
On a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 64% year-over-year. Total advertising revenue reached $513 million, up 60% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 67% on a year-over-year basis using constant currency. Twitter owned and operated advertising revenue was $447 million, up 42% year-over-year.
Off network advertising revenue reached $66 million or 13% of Ad revenue, up from 8% of Ad revenue in Q2 2015 and 2% in Q3 2014. Total Ad revenue growth continues to be driven by strong growth in demand from advertising products as once again we benefited from significant growth in our advertiser base.
From an advertising products perspective, gross was primarily driven by video and website card features on both the year-over-year and a quarter-over-quarter basis. We continue to improve the offering for direct response advertisers. And this was also a first four quarter auto-play video act.
By channel, SMB was again the fastest-growing on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth in new customers. Year-over-year growth accelerating Q3 versus Q2 for DSO channel driven by demand and by auto-play video. DSO remains our largest contributing advertising revenue. By region, international Ad revenue grew 66% year-over-year and U.S. Ad revenue grew 57% year-over-year.
Turning to monetization metrics. Year-over-year Ad revenue growth was driven by an increase in Ad engagements, which grew 165% year-over-year. This was primarily the result of a removed auto-play video in late Q2 as well as growth in our off network business.
Average CPE fell 39% year-over-year, due entirely to the shift of auto-play video as the cost per view of auto-play video is dramatically lower than that of click-to-play. This provides better value for advertisers. And to round out total revenue, data licensing and other revenue contributed $56 million in the quarter, an increase of 37% year-over-year.
Moving onto cost and EBITDA. In Q3, total non-GAAP expenses were $494 million, an increase of 45% year-over-year. The cost of revenue increased 79% year-over-year. Traffic acquisition costs or TAC were $42 million in the period, up from $4 million in the year ago period.
TAC was a meaningful driver of the increase, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as we continue to grow off-network revenue. R&D cost were $107 million in Q3. Growth in R&D spend is driven by increased headcount and related overhead cost primarily from recent acquisitions. On a percent of revenue basis, R&D cost were 90% of revenue quarter, down from 25% of revenue in Q3 2014.
Sales and marketing expense was also a driver of year-over-year growth and expenses totaling $166 million. Growth in these lines reflects continued global expansion of our sales effort. As a percent of revenue, sales and marketing costs were 29% of revenue versus 33% in the prior-year period.
Stock-based compensation expense can implore our expectations at $166 million and is down approximately $9 million with the start of Q2, driven primarily by forfeitures. Capital expenditures totaled $120 million in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $142 million, an increase of 108% year-over-year and also above the high end of our guidance range. 
A portion of the outperformance could be attributed to shipping of certain expenses from Q3 2015 to Q4 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margin for Q3 was 25% versus 19% in the prior-year period and versus 24% in Q2. Non-GAAP net income was $67 million in the quarter, up from $7 million in the same period a year ago. Our GAAP net loss in Q3 was $132 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.10 per share while GAAP EPS was at a loss of $0.20 per share.
Turning now to our audience. Total average monthly active users reached $320 million for the quarter reflecting year-over-year growth of 11%. As mentioned on our Q2 call, SMS fast follower users activations are not necessarily linear but they are mostly dependent upon major events or signing of new business development partnerships. And they use excluding SMS fast followers reached 307 million in Q3, compared to 304 million and they are using Q2 for growth rate of 8% on a year-over-year basis.
Now I will turn to our guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue to be in the range of $695 million to $710 million and adjusted EBITDA to be $155 million to $175 million. As a reminder, we announced a corporate restructuring two weeks ago. These actions are part of an overall plan that organized on our top product priorities and drive increased efficiencies throughout the company.
We plan to reinvest the savings in our most important growth there as going forward. Q4 GAAP expenses were included as the vast majority of the $5 million to $50 million on total restructuring charges expected from the corporate restructuring. Please note these charges are excluded from our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the fourth quarter. Also note, these charges are expected to total $10 million to $20 million in cash charges.
We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $107 million to $180 million in Q4. We expect the share count for Q4 to be approximately 682 million shares on a GAAP basis and the fully diluted share count to be approximately 710 million shares on a non-GAAP basis.
Capital expenditures for Q4 2015 we know more than $110 million. Finally, as he also did that square, we're fortunate to have Jack making very generous contribution of approximately one third of his holdings in Twitter for the benefit of current and future employees. These are approximately 7 million shares. We’ll go back into the equity pool and we’ll use to attract and retain great talent.
We’re also limiting shareholder dilution. For modeling purposes, once approved by shareholders at the next annual meeting the giveback we treated as a capital contribution with offsetting entries within stockholder equity. Subsequent distributions we treated as abnormal stock-based compensation expense
With that, we’d like to take your questions. Operator, can you please poll for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Post at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin, please go ahead.
Justin Post
Thank you. I believe the on and off-network disclosures are new and kind of interesting. Could you talk about exactly what off-network advertising is and maybe the difference in margin characteristics? Thank you.
Anthony Noto
Adam and I will tag team this answer. So off-network advertising would be that advertising that’s not on our owned and operated inventory. So TellApart would fall into that bucket. TapCommerce, a business that we bought over a year ago would be in that bucket. And then also Adam mentioned that Twitter audience platform network would be into that bucket. That’s a business that has traffic acquisition costs associated with it. We disclosed the traffic acquisition costs that will give you a sense for the impact on a cost basis relative to the rest of our business. And I’ll turn it over to Adam to talk about it more strategically.
Adam Bain
Yes. So it’s important to know when an advertiser comes to our ad UI, they now can with a single click expand their campaign from the Twitter owned and operated audience to the now over 700 million audience across the MoPub network. The other interesting thing to know is that we’re using the same targeting and the same creative, both on Twitter and also off of Twitter.
One other thing to note, we also are monetizing logged out users across the network; this is the first time that we've been doing that. It’s going to come in handy as we also begin to run a pilot here in Q4 for on Twitter logged out monetization. We’re going to take some of that learnings and apply it back on Twitter logged out ad products.
Justin Post
Great. Maybe one follow-up for Jack. I mean, it's a huge asset, the non-logged in users. How do you think about that value and how do you reach those people? Thank you.
Jack Dorsey
I think it’s amazing in that it shows the real reach of Twitter and that you go to twitter to say something to the world and you really reach the world. And that audience continues to increase and that reach continues to increase in a really meaningful way. So from a perspective of someone who is tweeting it’s one place and you can reach the entire globe.
Justin Post
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
I think there was a question in there too about the monetization of those logged out users. Adam, maybe you want to speak to that?
Adam Bain
Sure. From a monetization standpoint, we have some experience so far in monetizing logged out across the network. And what we’ve learnt so far doesn’t allow us to deviate from what we said previously in terms of what we think the opportunity exist in terms of logged out users.
Justin Post
Thank you.
Operator
Thanks. And the next question comes from Ross Sandler at Deutsche Bank. Ross, please go ahead.
Ross Sandler
Thanks. One for Anthony or Adam and then I guess, one for Jack. So Anthony if I caught the figures correctly, this is same as the last question. The O&O revenue of 447, was up about somewhere in the high 40s, call it 47% or so, ex-FX in the quarter. It’s well below last quarter’s run rates.
So just wondering if you can give us some more color on what’s driving the deceleration in O&O. Is that something deliberate or are advertisers choosing the syndication in a greater propensity in 3Q versus last quarter? And then what kind of O&O growth do you expect in the guidance in 4Q. And then the question for Jack, I guess, just on Moments. We’re only a few weeks in but anything you can say in terms of what you're seeing from a DAU perspective or higher usage of new twitter users who are experimenting with Moments that would be great. Thank you.
Anthony Noto
Thanks Ross. In terms of the owned and operated question, I’m going to give you a good sense of how we are approaching our business from channels and how it’s happened and transpired part over time. That’ll give you a sense for the slowdown, and then turn over to Adam to talk about the opportunity that we have within those channel.
So for those that aren’t familiar with Twitter, we have three advertising channels, direct sales organization, which really focuses on big branded advertisers. We built our business on the back of those advertisers, unlike other internet companies really delivering great value to them.
We also have the mid-market channel and the SMB channel. The SMB channel is our youngest channel so to speak and there is a significant opportunity there.
Within the DSO channel, we have an international business and a U.S. business. The U.S. DSO business has historically been driven by two factors: the growth in advertisers and the growth in spend per advertiser. We’re seeing less growth in advertisers now than we have in the past given this tremendous penetration that we’ve driven and the primary growth driver of the U.S. DSO business is now average revenue per advertiser.
The good news is there is significant opportunity for us to drive share of wallet with those advertisers. I will flip it over to Adam in a second to talk about specifically how we’re attacking that opportunity. As I mentioned on the call, our DSO business globally accelerated that was driven by the two-pronged growth internationally. The international DSO business is still benefiting from growth in penetration of advertisers and average spend per advertiser.
And then I'd also point out to you our youngest channel, the SMB channel, Adam mentioned we have over 100,000 SMB advertisers, our goal is to get to millions of advertisers, like our competitive peers, not in the hundred thousands, but millions and we’re really focused on driving those key benefits across creative targeting and measurement that Adam talked about previously. So I am going to flip over to him to talk about the U.S. DSO ARPA opportunity.
Adam Bain
Yes. So Ross, as we think about the advertiser opportunity, video in particular this past quarter was a huge driver in the amount and size of budgets for us. To your point about the network, we've seen so far that those budgets are actually incremental and not fighting against the owned and operated so that the marketers, especially in a couple of the product areas, the objective areas, are looking to scale budgets in that way.
And then I think at the macro level what we’re looking to do is look at this overall secular shift that’s happening with inside of the display advertising business, the bunch of money and underperforming display, what we’ve seen is that this money is starting to move overall into higher performing categories like those on Twitter. And so as we look ahead in Q4 and beyond, we think we’re really well set up with the network in particular. We also have a number of areas as I mentioned that we’re opening up into a pilot here in Q4, Promoted Moments is one. I just mentioned the logged out monetization on Twitter as another and then certainly we continue to scale the Twitter audience platform.
Anthony Noto
And then as it relates to the question on Moments and what we have achieved so far, let me answer the question directly on metrics and then turn it over to Jack to talk about the product in a bigger perspective that we have on it. We’re really excited about the launch of Moments and the potential it brings to Twitter-as-a-service and the reason why we’re excited about the launch is the first time we had a fully integrated launch across all cross-functions which we said we need to do in order to capture the next cohort of users to use Twitter.
Specifically we launched it not just with engineering product and design but also an integrated team across marketing, coms, content and media. As Jack mentioned, our first advertising commercial nationally will be on air tonight during the World Series. If you've been online or on mobile, you'll see your digital video ads, you will see our paid search ads, you will see our display ads and more to come on the marketing and content and media front. So we’re excited about all of those things and opportunity Moments brings to simplify our product and make it much easier to communicate our marketing.
It's only been three weeks. We are really focused on audience and engagement as you would imagine from a metric standpoint. We have nothing to report yet on those two metrics because it’s very early. We are encouraged by the signs that we’ve seen so far, but we still have opportunities to optimize across marketing channels and content quality and our choice and selection on content.
The one other thing I'd just point out from a metric standpoint and I want to make sure investors really appreciate this point is Moments by itself is simplifying our product, but there are many features within Moments that leverage the strength of Twitter, the social aspects of Twitter and the strength of our open communication network. So the retweet, the share, and the favorite, you can retweet, you can share, and you favorite within Moments and what that does is it provides content back to all your followers in their home timeline enhancing their experience. So Moments is about driving adoption without a doubt and engagement, but it’s also about reinforcing the quality and strength of every node in our network and so we’re also focused on those things. Jack?
Jack Dorsey
And Ross, thank you for the question. Moments represents a real fundamental shift in our thinking and the reason why is a lot of Twitter is organized by a reverse chronological timeline. We make people do a bunch of work to find the right accounts to follow and then they actually see the world through those accounts. What Moments does is you can open it up, you can actually see everything that’s happened in the world, that’s most meaningful, it's organized by topics, so you see topics first. You tap in to each one of those Moments and you can actually see really unique insight and commentary on the particular event that you’re interested in.
So it questions the reverse chronological timeline, provides a chronological narrative, a complete story that is human curated, so it gives you much deeper insight and at the same time you don’t have to do any of the work to find and follow accounts, you’re actually following topics and you can actually follow topics as well and you can follow them live. So as you see the World Series tonight, you can follow the World Series moment, it actually appears in your timeline as well. So see it as one source, one conversation piece that makes all of Twitter better and that’s just one initiative around making Twitter to easier to understand, there will be many, many more to come over the year.
Krista Bessinger
Great. And we will take our next question from Ben Schachter at Macquarie. Ben, please go ahead.
Ben Schachter
Hey, guys, a few questions. High level Jack, thinking out a few years from now, how do you view the revenue potential of products such as Periscope and Vine? I mean, do you see these things generating more than, I don’t know, 20%, 30% of revenue, are they still going to be relatively small a few years out from now?
And then separately, Anthony talked about growing a number of SMB advertisers, do you have to do that organically or could you partner with others to have that ramp more quickly? Thanks.
Adam Bain
I won’t talk about the particular revenue mix, but one other things that we’re really focused for both Vine and Periscope is to make sure that we have some of the best experiences within both of those products. I think those are both stellar brands, I think they're great standalone brands, they speak for something very specific in terms of a really creative ability and entertainment network and the Vine case and live streaming, the best implementation of live streaming out there in the Periscope case.
So we’re right now focused on making sure the end-to-end experience around both products is stellar and making sure we’re giving creators a whole lot more tools to express themselves better in a more creative way. And as I mentioned in prepared, Vine, we just added music. Periscope has a really significant and it’s really exciting roadmap coming up, which really stretches a boundary of what it means to see an event live and to see that unfold. And of course we will be looking to turn both of those into businesses and they will complement Twitter in the right way at the right time.
Anthony Noto
On the SMB front, Ben, I would just point out a couple of things and then have Adam add a few things. We have 9 million small businesses on our platform, they are already on our platform that we've identified by their activity and so it’s a great organic pool for us to recruit and to convert them into advertisers, not just consumers and not just content creators.
The other thing I would mention is we've announced a number of partnerships broadly that also are form of partnering. You thing about third-party attribution, we announced the Google deal, the DoubleClick deal, there will be other deals like that that allow us to get access to SMBs and to allow them to get data on our platform. Many small businesses are using DR and they are using that data to measure attribution not on Twitter. And once we are in that pool of measurement, we will have a better ability to compete day in, day out on the ROI which we’re doing such a great job on already.
Adam Bain
Yeah, I think on the SMB side, just this last quarter alone we really started opening up the amount of tools and analytics that are available to these SMBs and it proved to be a great conversion funnel for those small businesses. So we think we’ve got a bunch of opportunity to open up further the conversion funnel and ultimately when I talk about expanding the canvas for marketers that also comes into play in a really massive way I think for the small business segment bringing together things like analytics and ads, actions like customer service into one tight, neat little bundle.
Krista Bessinger
Great. So we will take our next question from Twitter, it comes from the account of Jason Moser. And he asks given early challenges with direct response, can you talk about your progress on DR, learning, goals and partnership?
Jack Dorsey
Yes. So it’s important to know that five years ago we started actually by building the brand business. So just in the last year we really started rolling out direct response tools and products for that marketer base. About 60% of digital display advertising, so there's a huge opportunity for us there. The biggest opportunity in the near-term I believe is on the measurement side. For five years we just haven't had any third-party measurement and attribution. I talked a little bit about some of the reasons why. It was hard for or almost impossible for third-party measurement attribution systems to measure mobile in-app activity accurately and connected downstream to the conversion.
And then also on Twitter, we got this really wide canvas of all these actions that take place, the clicks sure, but also retweets and follows and the like and we want to be able to show the connection between that on Twitter engagement all the way downstream. So I believe that the measurement deal with Google will help marketers better see and attribute value to that.
We also have launched even in this quarter alone a number of tools and improvements targeting the measurement. We just launched our own conversion lift reports for example which in an automated way allows an advertiser to run an AB test and run based on their targeting they’ve selected on Twitter a match that to their own conversion pixel. So a lot left to go for us, really feel like we get started on our DR products.
Krista Bessinger
Great. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley. Brian, please go ahead.
Brian Nowak
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two for Adam. The first one I guess is on the slowing O&O revenue growth. So wondering could you just talk about your agency and advertiser conversations and what do you think is the biggest hurdle Twitter has to overcome to really improve shared ad budgets moving on to the O&O platform into 2016?
Then the second one is kind of a follow-up. I was wondering how you think about the O&O ad load per user per day now and how you think about managing that over time?
Adam Bain
So I’ll take the first one, I will let Anthony take that little question. Our conversations with agencies and also with CMOs have never been stronger. They also look at us as a strategic partner and not just the media partner and that's really important, whereas other people just come in and talk about ad inventory or their scale. We can come in and talk about that and certainly now showing an audience size both on Twitter and across the network of over 700 million people, but we also come with analytics and insights, things around customer service or comps and PR, all these things that feed into the marketing engines of each one of these companies.
Overall in terms of where our focus, that's coming from the agencies or the exact focus that I outlined which is around measurement in ROI. There is a large demand out there for underperforming display to shift and so we think that’s a great near-term opportunity and that will come with improved measurement, improved attribution.
Just to give you a flavor what that looks like, the CEO of Datalogix, who is -- Datalogix is probably the industry-standard now and connecting online to offline behavior like in-store purchases, recently was on stage at an industry event and said, Twitter’s ROI is twice that of traditional display. So we’re excited about the start that we have there in terms of measurement attribution and we’re even more excited about the road ahead.
Anthony Noto
And then Brian in terms of your question on ad load, just to update, if you go back to Q2, we said that our ad loads at one-third of our long-term opportunity. We grew our advertising revenue sequentially 13% this quarter. Our ad load is roughly flat. We’re really benefiting from auto play video, which uses less inventory on monetization basis which really helps our businesses to see a mix shift towards that or so our ad load is roughly where it was in the second quarter which means we saw three times of the opportunity ahead of us.
The other point I'd make is those measurements do not include stuff we are not monetizing. So it does not include logged out, it doesn't include the profile pages that are logged out, it doesn’t include the single tweet detailed pages that are logged out, it does not include Vine or Periscope and it doesn't include Moments. And there are other areas that will continue to build on that drive consumption and audience aggregation inventory for us, but that just gives you sense of where we’re and what we are monetizing today and some areas that we haven't started to monetize yet.
Brian Nowak
Okay. Thanks.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thanks. And our next question comes from James Cakmak at Monness Crespi Hardt. James, please go ahead.
James Cakmak
Hi, thanks. It seems like you guys are making pretty rapid iterations on the tools for advertisers, but not as that I would say on the product side. I mean Moments I think is a very innovative feature, but, Jack, is at a high level, can you just talk about how we can expect the product experience to evolve, is it going to be building on Moments, or is it going to evolve and morph into something more and how should we think about the product iterations there?
And then secondly, as it become more of a platform and then syndicate the content across third party sites, I guess where is the emphasis philosophically for Twitter, is it to become a platform or is it increasingly to become a destination by being a place where people go for everything real time? Thank you.
Jack Dorsey
Thank you, James. So when I came back into the company, one of the first things that we did was really look at the roadmap and looked at what we're building. And we made some decisions to say no to something so we could focus on most meaningful product initiatives that we thought would bring the greatest potential for growth and usage. Moments is one of those bold new experiences that I think does question a bunch of our fundamentals around making Twitter a whole lot easier to understand.
And the goal here is that you open up the service whether on Twitter.com, whether you see it on a website, those not owned by us but it’s actually embedded or whether you open up the app and immediately you see what's going on and it’s the best the Twitter in one place. And it’s done in a very curated story, chronological narrative way that makes sense and gives you insight into an event that you just would not be able to see elsewhere.
So on the roadmap going forward, we have a number of iterations that continue to make Twitter easier to understand and make it far more approachable than has been in the past. And then we’re also looking at some more bold rethinking and some more bold experiences that really speak to some patterns that we've seen on Twitter from day one.
An example of this is we have a huge number of communities on Twitter from people who are interested in very niche topics to actually larger movements like hashtag BlackLivesMatter that we can actually take an opportunity and connect people to immediately, so they can start conversing and talking and sharing whatever they find and whatever they find most meaningful.
Second, we've always seen a huge appetite for customer service, whether that would be praising brands or complaining about a particular service where a brand can actually turnaround a conversation completely. We think there’s a lot of potential to make this a whole lot easier and that's within our app and within our service but also extending out to our platform.
As we said at Flight last week, we do think that the platform, the network aspect of our service is fundamental to both us and to the world and developers make all the possible and we will continue to build great tools to extend the power of all of our developers, but also to extend the reach of Twitter. So we will focus a lot of our energy on a very simple easy straightforward experience when people download the app or they go to Twitter.com. But at the same time whenever someone tweets or uses our platform to share that it goes out to the farthest reaches of the world and that’s why the network is important and building more and more experiences into Twitter but also being able to show more of our tweets everywhere. So it’s a balance of both.
James Cakmak
Appreciate the color.
Jack Dorsey
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Great. And our next question comes from Periscope and the question is, when is Twitter Moments coming to the U.K. and the rest of the world?
Jack Dorsey
So we have an international rollout strategy for the product and we don’t want to preannounce any markets or preannounce any product releases. We want to get it to everyone in the world in their hands as quick as we can. And what I will tell you is that we want to build in the learnings from our launch in the U.S. and do it in an integrated way, the way we have in the U.S. in each one of those markets, so more to come.
Krista Bessinger
And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente at Nomura. Anthony, please go ahead.
Anthony DiClemente
Thanks a lot for taking my questions. I have a couple for Anthony on the metrics and then one for Jack. Anthony, I apologize if I missed it, but what are you expecting in terms of overall fourth quarter MAU trends? And then in the second quarter you gave us engagement as defined by DAUs divide by MAUs, I think was 44%. Can you please give us that metric for the third quarter? And what do you expect it to be in the fourth quarter?
And then Jack, as you look ahead into 2016 and beyond, it seems to us that Twitter as a second screen should continue to be a big opportunity. We see Twitter partnering with media companies like CBS for big events like the debate, you mentioned the Mets tonight. Does partnership with big media around events remain a big opportunity for you or do you look at those types of agreements more so as incremental from here? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Thank you, Anthony. First on your question on monthly active users, we don’t give guidance on monthly active users, but I do want to give you a perspective on total audience and how we think about that relative to the opportunity and give you a perspective on where we see things today. First, I think it’s really important that everyone understands that we’re focused on the total audience opportunity and we really benefit from over 90% global brand awareness in our most important global market.
We have less than 30% penetration in monthly active users in those markets, obviously, higher when you include logged out and syndicate audience but just on a monthly active user base is less than 30%. And it’s our opportunity to turn those numbers of a monthly active users into where are awareness is. And we said in the second quarter that we have to simplify the product. We have to have very clear communications of value. And we have to execute discipline to bring that all together.
And ultimately our products need to change in a fundamental way to appeal to that next cohort. Moments is the first of other product changes that we’re making that are fundamental to attracting that next cohort and simplifying the product. But it’s only been three weeks and so there is no change in a monthly active user outlook, given this product is very as soon as it’s developed.
As it relates to your question on DAU to MAU, we gave that metric to give you an update on where we were since we announced it at the Analyst Day in our top 20 markets. It’s not a metric that we are prepared to keep reporting every quarter. And what we will do is which is our responsibility is that when we see a significant deviation of the top 20 DAU to MAU change, we’ll be sure to disclose that to you. Thank you.
Jack Dorsey
Okay. Thanks. Part of the answer on the second screen piece. We’ve seen great traction in terms of historically when people are watching TV, they also are tuning into Twitter, sometimes exclusively into Twitter. When people are having a conversation about a TV program, it will increase the chance that people turn into linear television. We've made a number of improvements to the core products and also to the content that’s coming out of the platform to coincide.
This past quarter we announced a deal with the National Football League for our amplify program. The program that brings about a 100 video clips a week from the NFL on to the platform. Twitter actually controls the sales process there as well, so there is an added benefit. This quarter we also in New York announced are open amplify program and signed up over 40 television and content partners, people like Fox Sports, MTV, National Geographic, Weather Channel, WWE and a whole bunch more.
Essentially with that platform allows them to do is bring their content into Twitter and have a way to take advantage of Twitter's ad sale and ad serving functionalities to that. When clips are going live on TV, they also are coming on the Twitter in real time.
Anthony Noto
Every event we’ve seen is always better with Twitter. Baseball twitter is greater twitter. Election twitter is great twitter. So hope you follow on tonight with world service.
Anthony DiClemente
Thanks.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thanks. And our next question will come from Eric Sheridan at UBS. Eric, please go ahead.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the questions, maybe one for Anthony and one bigger picture question. Anthony, in terms of the way you're thinking about you guided to Q4 on the EBITDA side, maybe got to understand some of the puts and takes involved in the guidance there on the cost side of the equation, just so we understand some of the velocity, the numbers as we exit the year.
And bigger picture question, you talked earlier about the partnerships with Google, wanted to understand what you've seen so far from public tweets appearing in search results, would that’s mean for traffic coming back to the platform, as well as in the call you can give about inventory going into DoubleClick exchange? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Sure. I’ll take the first two and I’ll put Adam on the DoubleClick exchange. On the EBITDA guidance for Q4, I would note a couple of things, one, we did have some cost that we anticipated in Q3 that will now occur in Q4. Additionally, I said in the past, we really want to balance our -- balance two things, our investment in the growth opportunity in front of us and not under investing that opportunity but not invest blindly that we don’t have constraint.
And so we’re managing to a profitability level that gives us some constraint but make sure that we're investing in the business to maximize its value in the long term. And that’s the philosophy we’re taking in the fourth quarter and we’ll continue to take into the future, balance an important measurement. The other thing I’d say about the fourth quarter is a big part of the fourth quarter is the revenue in December is a very important element to it. Last year, our December month actually accelerated over 110% year-over-year growth versus October and November that had high 80% year-over-year growth, that can provide a lot of operating leverage.
When you get to that month, that’s really hard to forecast in your guidance and so, on the level of scale of revenue in the December month, we’ll also have an impact on ultimate level of EBITDA. But it’s really that investing but we did invest in the third quarter, continue to invest in the huge opportunity you have in front of us and then ultimately where our revenue comes in for the fourth quarter.
As it relates to the Google relationship, there is really three elements to this. I’m going to talk specifically to the search element, the other two elements or the ad attribution deal and then the DoubleClick, which Adam can talk to you.
As it relates to the Google search deal, we are really positive about the deal. It’s been a great partnership, every week the iteration with the partnership at Google have continued to improve. We reached a point now where we have billions of impressions of our tweets on Google’s platforms everyday.
And that provides a great source of traffic back to Twitter that we can monetize in a logged out-state that we can gradually onboard into a logged in-state. But the other important element that Google search deals that expands our reach and reinforces the flywheel we have with this total audience strategy.
It gives those people that contribute to Twitter our brands and our partners, media partners and individuals in other region to tweet. It gives them an ability to reach more of the world as Jack mentioned. And so, there is multiple facets to the Google search deal and we’re rally encourage about what we achieve so far and look forward to more to come.
Adam Bain
On the search side when we talk to CMOs and show them the search integration, they get very excited because as Anthony mentioned, it gives the brand yet another reason to tweet, not just helps their Twitter activity, but also helps their organic search activity as well.
And then on the DoubleClick side, as Anthony mentioned, there is really two parts of DoubleClick. There's the ad measurement side and then there is Ads API or DBM, DoubleClick Bid Manager side.
Demand is strong for both. On the measurements side, we’re going to get started in the -- at the end of Q4 in our first set of pilot partners together with DoubleClick. So we’re excited about the opportunity there, because like I had mentioned before, we’ve gone five years without any third-party management attribution.
And then on the DBM side, there are a set of advertisers who only will spend with inside of DoubleClick. And so we’re excited to get integrated into there as well, because there will be a set of active advertisers that we just currently don't touch today.
Krista Bessinger
Great. And we’ll take our next question from Twitter comes from the Twitter account of Rich Greenfield at BTIG. And he ask world series ads are expensive plus ongoing TV ad campaigns, how do you think about marketing spend in 2016?
Adam Bain
What I’d say is what I’ve said in the past. We want to invest in the opportunity in front of us and make sure we maximize that for shareholders without having no constraints for responsibility as it relates to profitability.
So that's really the flask we will take towards it. We have three and a half month before we report the fourth quarter and share with you a perspective on 2016 and when we get to that point, we’ll give you more details.
Krista Bessinger
Great. And I think we have time now for just one last question. And our final question will come from Brian Pitz at Jefferies. Brian, please go ahead.
Brian Pitz
Thanks. And congratulations to Omid, coming on as Executive Chairman. Jack, maybe some comments on your current vision and approach compared with that of the company historically, and any additional insights on the roadmap and when we may see the largest impact to engagement going forward? Thanks.
Jack Dorsey
Thanks, Brian. We’re not going to get into the details of the roadmap in particular, but what you’ll see from us is against two themes and this is going forward, which is really how do we make Twitter even easier to understand for more people, so that we continue to see more of that usage, people can bring it up and see everything that's happening in the world immediately.
But also how do we get more power to people who are using it to tweet. And that’s not just Twitter but also our properties like Vine and Periscope. How we giving creators more tools to be more creative and to express themselves in a different way and giving the folks on Periscope even more reach in order to share what's happening around them in a very interesting and unique way, which is live streaming.
So, again, we have a number of things on the roadmap, which are iteration, which continue to make Twitter easier. And then we have some things that we think are pretty bold in terms of really speaking to patterns that we've seen throughout our history.
Having to do with communities and running people to those communities much faster, but also with customer service and making all those activities a whole lot easier on Twitter so that anyone can pick it up and use it immediately.
And we’ll continue to increase our pace of execution and ship faster and ship more meaningful things as we continue to really simplify what we’re working on and really making sure that we have a small and nimble team focused on the right things.
Brian Pitz
Great. Thanks.
Jack Dorsey
Thanks, Brian.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thanks everyone on the phone for joining us. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the call to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks, Avogale, and good afternoon. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call and thanks for joining us. We have with us today our Interim CEO, Jack Dorsey; and CFO, Anthony Noto.
Today, in addition to connecting with you on Twitter, we’re using Periscope to show you behind the scenes view of the call. We’ve always used Twitter to bringing closer to the discussion, but now through Periscope, we can bring you inside the room and show you around.
Periscope is the best way to watch, to share and watch live video from a mobile phone. It’s about seeing the world through someone else’s eyes and sharing and experiencing a live moment. It’s not about a overly produced and additive video. So bear with us as we read our prepared remarks and occasionally check our note. But we hope you enjoy what it’s like to be transported into the room with us today and experience how powerful we think this platform can be.
Moving on to the Safe Harbor, we’ll begin with approximately 15 minutes of prepared remarks followed by Q&A. During the Q&A, we will take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the #TWTRearnings.
We’d also like remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call, such as our outlook for Q3 and 2015 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today’s date, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our earnings release. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. This call in its entirety is being webcast from our Investor Relations website and being broadcast over Periscope. An audio replay of the call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.
Jack Dorsey
Thank you, Krista, and hello from San Francisco everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I also want to welcome all of those tuning in to watch our prepared remarks and Q&A live via Periscope.
To start, I want to thank our shareholders and most importantly I want to thank everyone for who uses Twitter. And I want to note that it’s pretty amazing we’re able to follow the commentary about this call and our earnings report live directly through our service. So let’s get into it.
We’ve been very successful at monetization, with a strong Q2, delivering over $500 million in revenue and more than $120 million in EBITDA. However, product initiatives we’ve mentioned in previous earnings calls like instant timelines and logged out experiences have not yet had meaningful impact on growing our audience or participation. This is unacceptable and we’re not happy about it.
Over the past few weeks, I’ve had a chance to get a deeper understanding of where I need to focus our team. We need to do three things. One, we need to ensure a more disciplined execution. Two, we need to simplify our service to deliver Twitter’s value faster. And three, we need to better communicate our value.
Now, let me know go through each. First of all, we haven’t done a great job at aligning the entire company around our total audience strategy. We’re in the process of implementing a stronger discipline of direct ownership and accountability that clearly serves a single strategy in order to increase our reach, value to people and participation. The people, the organizations and the companies that use Twitter must come first and be at the center of everything we do.
Second, you will see us continue to question our reverse chronological timeline and all of the work it takes to build one by finding and following accounts through experiences like why you are away and Project Lightning which launches this fall. Our goal is to show more meaningful tweets and conversations faster, whether that’s logged in or out of Twitter. It’s been awesome to use these new experiences daily and I believe we should strike the right balance of recency and relevance in a way that feels really great that truly show the power of Twitter immediately. And I can’t wait for all of you to experience it yourself.
Third and finally, we have unbelievably high brand awareness globally. People all over the world know of the power of Twitter, but it’s not clear why they should harness it themselves. An answer to why Twitter must be articulated clearly and felt everywhere throughout the service. We are advancing this marketing communications work as fast as possible and ensuring it’s coordinated with the simplification of our service. Anthony will speak to this more in his remarks.
We will take the necessary time to build the service people love to use every single day. And we realize it will take some time to show results we all want to see. A greater clarity of our purpose, our objectives and putting the people that use Twitter first drives the urgency we now feel. So what should you expect from Twitter?
You should expect Twitter to be as easy as looking out your window to see what’s happening. You should expect Twitter to show you what’s most meaningful in the world to live it first before anyone else and straight from the source. And you should expect Twitter to keep you informed and updated throughout your day.
But Twitter can’t just be the best window to the world; Twitter also has to be the most powerful microphone in the world. You should expect Twitter to increase your reach and you should expect Twitter to encourage live and direct conversation and participation around whatever you share.
If we meet these expectations, and we will, Twitter will become the first thing everyone in the world checks to start their day and the first thing people turn to when they want to share ideas, commentary, or simply what’s happening.
And now over to Anthony to provide a perspective on our financial results and outlook before we open up to questions.
Anthony Noto
Thank you, Jack, and good afternoon everyone. I will discuss our financial and operating performance for Q2 and provide guidance for Q3 and the full year.
Total revenue reached $502 million, an increase of 61% year over year and $17 million above the high end of our guidance range. On a constant currency basis, total revenue grew 68% year over year.
Ad revenue reached $452 million, up 63% year over year on a reported basis and up 71% year over year on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue was driven by strong demand as well as growth in our advertiser base which accelerated year over year.
From an advertising products perspective, year over year growth was driven by promoted tweets and specifically promoted tweet features such as video, mobile app downloads and website cards.
Importantly, these features were also the primary driver of quarter over quarter revenue growth as we continue to execute on initiatives to improve targeting, measurement and creative capabilities for our advertisers with direct response objectives. Finally, the promoted video ads feature moved to autoplay late in the quarter, with some of the strictest quality standards for a monetizable event in the industry.
By channel, SMB was again the fastest-growing channel on a year over year basis, driven by growth in new customers. Our DSO channel remains our largest overall contributor. By region, international ad revenue grew 75% year over year and US advertising revenue grew 57% on a year over year basis.
Turning to monetization metrics, year over year ad revenue growth was driven by an increase in both ad engagements and cost per ad engagement. Ad engagements grew 53% year over year, driven by an increase ad load, growth in audience, and the move to autoplay video. CPE grew 6% year over year, driven by both higher pricing of our direct response ad formats and mix shift. Lastly, on ad revenue, we closed the acquisition of TellApart on May 22 and we are very happy to have Josh McFarland and his team on board.
For the five weeks it was part of Twitter in Q2, TellApart contributed $12 million of reported results. As you think about Q3, please note that we do not expect the full quarter contribution from TellApart revenue to increase sequentially relative to the Q2 run rate and it’s possible it may even decline. And to round out total revenue, data licensing and other revenue contributed $50 million in the quarter, an increase of 44% year over year.
Before moving down the income statement, I’d like to highlight a few points related to the progress we’ve made in our direct response capabilities and feature set for advertisers. Overall, we’re starting to see a positive response to improvements we are making across targeting, measurement and creative for advertisers.
First, we are seeing solid improvement in growth of spend through these advertisers driven by improved auction dynamics and higher returns. Second, objective-based campaigns were made generally available in May and the demand continues to be strong with related increase in CPE on a like-for-like basis. We will continue to iterate in these three areas and hope to see continued improvement in the coming quarters.
Moving on to cost and EBITDA, in Q2, total non-GAAP expenses were $443 million, up 50% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by headcount and related overhead costs as well as investments in infrastructure and sales and marketing. We continue to invest in our workforce across all functions [to scale] our business and our total headcount reached approximately 4,100 employees at the end of the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $120 million, an increase of 122% year over year and also above the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA margin for Q2 was 24% versus 17% in the prior year period and in line with that of Q1.
Non-GAAP net income was $49 million in the quarter, up from $15 million in the same period a year ago. Our GAAP net loss in Q2 was $137 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.07 per share, while GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.21 per share.
Now, turning to our audience. As I noted throughout the quarter, MAUs in Q2 did not benefit from the same factors that benefited Q1. Specifically, we did not see organic growth, positive seasonality or growth initiatives seen in Q1. We reached 304 million MAUs in Q2, excluding SMS Fast Followers, compared to 302 million MAUs in Q1 for a growth rate of 12% on a year over year basis. Total average monthly active users, which as a reminder includes SMS Fast Followers, reached 316 million for the quarter, reflecting year over year growth of 15%.
It’s important to note that while sequential growth of SMS Fast Followers was strong in Q2, user activations are not necessarily linear for these types of users. As a result, net additions in future periods could vary. As Jack mentioned, we’re obviously not satisfied with these results. In the couple of months since assuming responsibility to lead marketing, we’ve done a deep dive into the issues driving MAUs and usage and are developing a marketing strategy and plan to address this. I want to share with you a few observations from that process.
First, we are incredibly fortunate to have over 95% brand awareness across the most important global markets. This is outstanding and puts Twitter [indiscernible]. Despite this enormous awareness, we’ve achieved less than 30% penetration of users in these markets.
This low level of penetration implies that we have only reached early adopters and technology enthusiasts and we have not yet reached the next cohort of users known as the mass market. We believe the reason is that we have failed to do two critical things. First, we have not clearly communicated Twitter’s unique value and so that’s reflected in everything we do across product, content and marketing, and as a result, non-users can ask why should I use Twitter?
Additionally, we have not delivered on meeting the new potential user’s expectations of Twitter when they try the product. Simply said, the product remains too difficult to use. As Jack mentioned, we need to simplify the product so everyone get value from Twitter faster. In short, we have not communicated why people should use Twitter, nor made it easy for them to understand how to use Twitter. This is both a product issue and a marketing issue.
We’ve seen other products overcome these same issues and successfully make their transition to reach the mass market adoption phase and we are confident we can do the same. To solve this problem is critical we define our unique value and ensure that uniqueness is reflected in our product or content or marketing.
We’re working as rapidly as we can to put us in a position to launch an integrated marketing strategy and marketing campaign before the end of 2015. We have also begun the process of hiring a CMO and are encouraged by the quality candidates that we are in dialog with today.
To be clear, however, we do not expect to see sustained meaningful growth in MAUs until we start to reach the mass market. We expect that will take a considerable period of time. What I can tell you today, though, is we will be bolder, move faster, and raise the bar in everything we do to unlock value for shareholders by ensuring disciplined execution.
Now, before moving on to the outlook, I wanted to provide an update into some key data points as it relates to the long-term opportunities we discussed at our Analyst Day. First, the ratio of DAU to MAU for our top 20 markets in Q2 2015 was approximately 44% versus the 48% we shared with you at our Analyst Day which is for the first three quarters of 2014. 
Second, ad load, as measured by total ad impressions divided by total tweet impressions is approximately one-third of what we see as the long-term potential. Third, since going public, our revenue growth has primarily been driven by increased users, increased monetization via the load factor and other factors. During this period, supply has been greater than demand. However, over time, we recognized that if we do not grow audience, drive increased engagement or begin to monetize other areas such as logged out, it is possible that [indiscernible] our revenue could be impacted by limited availability for specific ad types.
Now, I’ll turn to our guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue to be in the range of $545 million to $560 million and adjusted EBITDA to be $110 million to $115 million. We expect stock based compensation expense in the range of $190 million to $200 million. Finally, we expect share count for Q3 to be approximately 675 million shares on a GAAP basis and the fully diluted share count to be approximately 708 million shares on a non-GAAP basis.
For the full year 2015, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.27 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be $520 million to $540 million. We expect stock based compensation expense in the range of $750 million to $790 million and we expect capital expenditures to be the in the range of $450 million and $550 million.
To wrap up, I’ve been at Twitter for just over a year. I joined the company because of the significant opportunity I believe we have to build one of the most successful companies in the world. Over the course of the last 13 months, my view in that opportunity has not changed. The unique value that Twitter provides partners, companies and individuals gives us the best aggregated real-time content in the world. Twitter is incredibly unique in that it makes other companies and partners better. That said, we have a significant amount of work ahead of us to turn that opportunity into a reality and we’re committed to doing just that for our company, our shareholders and our partners.
With that, we’d like to take your questions. Operator, can you please poll for questions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler
Thanks for doing the Periscope. That looks great. Just two questions, one for Anthony and then one for Jack. Anthony, on the topic of supply outstripping demand in the ad business, where do you think you’ll be on the DR advertising side by the time we get to the fourth quarter? Do you think that targeting attribution and measurement will be in place? And how much do you expect TellApart to contribute in the fourth quarter based on your full year guidance?
And then Jack, on the product side, I guess, Project Lightening and the Google partnership were the two biggest things you guys have done off late. But can you give us an update on traffic and retention from these? And then do you broadly think that these are the types of initiatives that will break us into the mainstream or the mass market as you guys talked about or do we need full overhaul in the future?
Anthony Noto
First in terms of your question, DR is approximately 25% of our overall revenue, it’s the fastest growing channel that we have. DSO or direct sales, branded advertisers, still is the largest contributor. We don’t have a specific forecast for where DR will be by Q4.
And as it relates to TellApart, we have no plans to monetize the business. We continue to believe – sorry, on TellApart, contribution to the second half of the year, the only comment I’d make is I would tell you that that business is dependent on third party inventory. And we bought the business knowing that some of that third party inventory which are our competitors could go away and there would be a transition time period ultimately to put that inventory to other channels. And so that’s factored into our outlook.
I made a specific comment not to expect the Q2 revenue run rate to be up sequentially and it could potentially be down sequentially in Q3 and that was specifically because of that transition and knowing we’d have to have to make that investment.
Jack Dorsey
As it relates to your question on overall supply, I’m simply stating because our growth rate in users is slowing quite dramatically. We’re giving you a sense in our load factor that there are scenarios where we can have a significant increase in daily revenue demand and specific mix shift towards one particular type of ad category. And if that happens, we could be more constrained than we have been in the past from a supply standpoint.
As it relates to the Google deal, we are very happy with the broad relationship we have with Google. It’s not just about the distribution and search deal, it’s also about the ads deal, ads EPI as well as third-party attribution. And so we enjoy working with them.
As it relates specifically to the Google search daily integration, the deal is only partially implemented; it’s implemented in the US. There are other languages we will expand into specifically within English-speaking countries. Also it’s only on mobile, we haven’t expanded it to desktop.
Additionally, it’s focused primarily on events, celebrities, politicians and the news breaking things, and so it’s a small segment of the overall opportunity that we have with them and they have with us. So far, we’re happy with what we’re seeing, but it’s really too early to have a meaningful impact on our business or to quantify the contribution that it’s making.
Anthony Noto
And on the product side, specifically your question was around Project Lightning, this is not being launched yet. We expect to launch it in the fall. The ideas behind around really pushing up the best content found within Twitter immediately with some human editorial curation to find more context and also to help us find the best tweets. It’s something we’ve been able to play with internally and so far it feels really great. We’re discovering a lot of amazing content on the service. And it does have that immediacy that we love about Twitter, but it also has this great contextual addition as well, which tells a better story. So we’re really, really excited about the direction, but it is early and we’re going to learn from it internally and then can’t wait for you all to see it externally as well.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with Barclays.
Paul Vogel
You guys talked about attracting the mass market, but I guess it looks like over the years, it’s been over a billion unique users created and you have about 302 million, or 304 million monthly actives right now. So A, if we think about that number accurately, how should we think about the mass market you need to attract, do you think you’ve attracted a lot of them and they haven’t stayed or do you think there’s still this huge opportunity of people who never sampled it and you need to expose them to what Twitter is? I guess, how should we think about reengagement versus new customers?
Anthony Noto
I think it’s about addressing both of those. Those that have tried to use to Twitter and found it be too hard to use and those that have not tried. The number one reason from our market research that users don’t use Twitter because they don’t understand why to use Twitter. They don’t understand the value that Jack and I both talked about and we need to clearly communicate what that value is.
The number two reason why users do not use Twitter because they don’t know how to use Twitter. And so our efforts to simplify the product, our efforts to communicate that value clearly are necessary to go to that next cohort of potential users and have them be retained the mass market. So it’s a combination of those that have tried and haven’t stayed with the service and those that have never used it.
Jack Dorsey
And just to add to that as well, we intend to not only answer that with marketing and better communication around that value, but also to meet those expectations that we set forth in the product itself. And we need to make sure that we’re telling a consistent and a cohesive story and I think that’s the biggest opportunity internally as to ensure more of that disciplined execution to think cohesively, to think from the marketing message all the way into when someone gets into our app and utilizes it and is encouraged to use it on a daily basis.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Krista Bessinger
Operator, we can go to the next person in the queue please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Eric Sheridan
Anthony, maybe just to, you talked a little bit about ad base reaccelerating in the quarter. [indiscernible] confirm that it was in terms of the number of advertising user Twitter and what might drive that? And then the second question, when you announced the CEO announcement later in the quarter, about a couple of weeks back, you reiterated the quarter being [NOI] I wanted to see if the strength in beating the numbers actually results from June being better than expected, in which case you exited with a better run rate for advertising revenue growth exiting the quarter?
Anthony Noto
So your first question in terms of number of advertisers, yes, the absolute number of advertisers on a year over year basis grew faster in Q2 than it grew in Q1. We’ve talked about the opportunity to move from tens of thousands of advertisers to millions of advertisers. We’re fortunate in that, we’re just about to pass the 100,000 advertiser mark.
And there is a couple of things that we will continue to do to grow the overall advertiser base. Clearly, continuing to provide new formats, something like autoplay video, it’s an entirely new format relative to just promote a video that will attract new types of advertisers. Additionally, mobile application download is something we launched in July, August of last year in addition to some other direct response products.
So we’ll continue to innovate as it relates to the actual formats advertisers want and that will allow them to better target their particular potential customers and get better ROI. We’ll also continue to focus on improving creative design to give them again a better way to deliver their message to the end user and therefore better ROI and then measurement. And so we’re iterating on all three of those dimensions and that’s what’s allowing us to grow the advertiser base. Our goal is to hit the 1 million to 2 million range that some of our competitor peers are at and we’re still at our first 100,000. So there is a big opportunity in front of us still.
As it relates to the quarter, what I’d say is the performance in the quarter, there was no significant changes as we entered the last month of the quarter. We continued on a trend line that we had throughout the quarter and that ultimately ended up with our total revenue of $502 million.
Krista Bessinger
And we will take the next question from Twitter, it comes from the Twitter account of [Jordon Roberts]. And the question is how does the monetization of SMS users differ from the full desktop or mobile users? And how do you plan to close the gap overtime?
Jack Dorsey
So I think it’s important to put into context what the strategy is behind SMS Fast Followers users, again these are users that are defined as individuals that have signed up for Twitter through SMS as opposed to one of our specific clients. Our MAUs excluding SMS Fast Followers have used a specific client to sign up for the product. They may access the product overtime via any client or any product like SMS.
So these specific users that we’ve coined the phrase SMS Fast Followers are users in growth markets that are largely on feature phones and they’re signing up for the product via SMS. And we’re delivering them information based on specific followers they may choose or program list that we decide to transmit to them. They are monetizable, we did monetize a few of them in the first quarter.
We’re continuing to look for ways to not just drive monetization, but more importantly drive increased engagement. We’re planning to seize in these markets today with a very complicated product. And so as those markets evolve and the adoption of the smartphone reaches these featured phone users, they will be more than familiar with the brand, they already have used it in its most complex state and will build a really tight relationship with them. And overtime, we will trade them up to a more engaged experience and on a smartphone which will monetize at much, much higher rates than what will be monetized in SMS Fast Followers format.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney
Two questions. Jack, could you just give us an update on the CEO search and your personal plans? And then could you talk broadly about the – you talked about the MAU trends, but what about the engagement trends? And I know you’re not necessarily providing metrics, but as you look at what’s happened across Twitter, the Twitter-sphere, the engagement of the current MAUs, any notable trends there and any possibly adverse impact from the rollout of video or is that leading to greater engagement?
Jack Dorsey
I know this is a trending topic on Twitter around the CEO search, but unfortunately we do not have an update to provide today. The search committee does feel the urgency of the search, but it is doing its work to make sure that we arrive at the best answer. And we’ll have updates when there is something meaningful to share.
My focus is entirely on raising the bar of our execution and making sure that we’re focused on the right things. And as I said in my prepared remarks, it’s really around simplifying our service and making sure that people can get in and get to the value of Twitter faster and in a more immediate way, in a more relevant way and also making sure that we have a good communication of what that value is even before they get into the app. And that’s all the work we’re doing with the marketing. So I’m focused on what I believe to be the most meaningful thing and I’m spending a lot of time on it.
In terms of engagement, do you want to talk about other trends?
Anthony Noto
So as we’ve said in the past, we measure engagement in a lot of different ways. Obviously, daily active users is one measure of engagement relative to monthly active users and I just provided an update on where that was in Q2 for our top 20 markets. In addition to that, we look at other things like number of searches conducted, which is actually growing very well, the number of direct messages sent which actually accelerated. There’s not one level of engagement metric that we look at and so it depends on whether or not we’re talking about advertising usability and these other measurements that I mentioned in terms of other activities on the property and service.
The last thing I’d say about video, you referenced that, autoplay video is a win for everybody. It’s a win for the advertiser, we don’t charge them until there is a three-second viewing time with 100% viewability at that point in time. It’s easier for the consumer, they don’t have to click on the ad, they can simply fly through Twitter and see videos as they are playing and decide to stop and view or continue moving on. The engagement rates for them are actually higher than the engagement rates for our other products. And that’s also in that process.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry
I was hoping you could give us a sense of as you look at managing through this transition, how are you approaching employee retention? What kind of increase or changes at all are you seeing in turnover among the type of employees that you’re trying to hold on to? And how in the current environment for talent within the valley is Twitter dealing with attracting the kind of people that you need?
Jack Dorsey
It’s a great question. I am entirely focused on building the best team. And a lot of that focus has to be around not just particular individuals, but the best team dynamic. And great teams love shipping products to people who will use them on a daily basis. And our focus is entirely around making sure that we unblock our team from shipping products faster, in a better way, and we also have the benefit of having a brand and having a tool, having a service that truly empowers people and that aligns a lot of folks who want to come in and have an impact on that tool.
So we definitely need to do a better job in ensuring an execution discipline to allow for people, enable people to ship faster. And I think our shipping cadence has improved over the past six months and we will continue to show improvements there. But there is a lot we could do around aligning folks around our purpose and around the objectives and making sure that we have direct ownership and accountability. That is a work and the discipline we are putting into the organization right now.
Krista Bessinger
And we will take the next question from Twitter; it comes from the account of [Nick Sorello]. And the question is does Twitter plan on integrating Vine, Periscope and Twitter into one app?
Anthony Noto
It’s a great question, Nick. We are always looking for opportunities to provide integration between all of our apps. We have the benefit of having some pretty amazing and engaging brands in Twitter, in Vine, and in Periscope. And we certainly want to make it easy to broadcast live, or to broadcast a six-second video from whichever app you are in. And we’re always looking for those opportunities. But nothing specific to update around today, but our goal is to make that easier and to provide more connection between all three.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan.
Douglas Anmuth
Jack, you mentioned Project Lightning coming in the fall, do you have a similar timeframe for moving beyond reverse chron order and can you talk about just some of the key considerations and challenges there as you think about doing that? And perhaps Anthony can give us an update on the early impact of DoubleClick Bid Manager.
Jack Dorsey
We actually have an initiative in the app today which is why you are away, which starts to break down the reverse chronological timeline and orders things by relevance, orders by relevance and it’s showing some good early results. This is an early product and we need to learn from it, but it is – it does point to the direction that we want to see more of – and again, we need to balance recency with relevance. I think Project Lightning does a fantastic job at that [indiscernible] is doing a great job at that as well. But there is a whole lot more work to do there.
In my own experience of using Twitter and my timeline now, we’re definitely seeing a lot more value at the top of my stream and definitely favouriting and retweeting and replying for those tweets right at the top, so that relevance is having an impact and right now we are finding the balance of how much push-outs versus the recency of the reverse chronological timeline. But we continue to show a questioning of our fundamentals in order to make the product easier and more accessible to more people.
Anthony Noto
And then, Doug, your second question is related to DoubleClick, there is two components to that deal. Obviously, third-party attribution and then what we call the ads API. Third-party attribution we haven’t introduced yet, we hope to do that in the fourth quarter, by the end of the year. We are ready to go on that as quick as a partner is in. It’s really an important element of our DR business and that there is some really large direct response advertisers especially in the financial services space where these partners [indiscernible] third-party attribution from DoubleClick where they have been with us. So we are excited about bringing that by the fourth quarter.
I would say the same thing about DoubleClick Bid Manager being a fourth quarter event. And since I’m talking about the fourth quarter, I’d also just indicate everyone that the TellApart business is something that will have this year for the first time in the fourth quarter and that is retail focused business on the retail vertical, which are really a big fourth quarter bid. So it’s something we have to consider.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal.
Brian Wieser
First, I know growth was stable in the US for the quarter, but I was wondering if you can provide any color around churn. And separately, I was wondering if you could talk about traction or just ongoing progress with MoPub and whether you have any sense where your market share is our ad serving, mediation or marketplace capabilities.
Jack Dorsey
In terms of retention, our retention rate for the quarter was the same as it was last quarter. So there is no change there. And then as it relates and to the MoPub business, we don’t break it out separately, what I would tell you is that the growth rate of the MoPub ad exchange business had a similar growth rate to our overall advertising business. We don’t break out the market share.
Krista Bessinger
We will take the next question from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of [Joe Elk], who asks how do you simplify the UX without degrading the feature set of power users?
Jack Dorsey
This is a great question and something we are very mindful of and one to find the right balance. First and foremost, we all inside the company use the product on hourly, it’s not minimally basis and there is a lot we love about it. But even for us as power users of the service, there is a lot we can do to increase the relevance of what we’re seeing.
And if we’re increasing the relevance of what we’re seeing, we are also increasing the potential of the relevance for people who are not familiar with the traditional Twitter models. We need to make sure that we provide a really graceful and unfolding path to get to more value faster for anyone that comes into the service. And that means they don’t have to consider what Twitter is, they just have to consider what they are there for.
And we think Project Lightning is a good example of showing this. While You Were Away is a good example of showing this. And there’s opportunities where we can place this in our traditional model such as at the top of the reverse chronological timeline; in the Project Lightning case on a separate tab so that you can go to that tab and you can actually discover new content and discover new events and discover what’s happening in the world easily. But also as you follow and as you work to build that following for your reverse chronological timeline, you can go back there as well.
And this is something we want to make sure that we continue to optimize and make sure that we’re speaking to the needs of our more sophisticated folks because it is meaningful, but it is a fine balance. We think search is a big part of this as well. We do see a lot of folks who are familiar with the service use search in really compelling ways and we want to make sure that we’re making that easier and easier as well. So more relevance benefits everyone, but at the same time we need to make sure that we’re balancing that with what we’re known for in terms of recency and live and that roar of the crowd feeling.
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.
Anthony DiClemente
I have one for Jack and a couple quick ones for Anthony. Jack, philosophically, as you look to grow the audience at Twitter, just wondering are all users treated equal, such that you just do whatever you can to grow the audience as quickly as possible or in your mind are there types of users either by geography or by demographic, by cohort that you would focus on organizationally given their monetization capability over the long-term and then just wondering if that will inform where and how you guys roll out your marketing campaign that you mentioned?
And then Anthony, I just wonder to what degree was an increase in the load factor a driver of the reacceleration in ad engagements in the quarter? I know that in your prepared remarks, you talked about ad load of Twitter being a third of its long-term potential, but just wondering if there’s any interplay or any dots to be connected between load factor and engagement in terms of the DAU over MAU numbers that you cited. And then finally, can you just talk to us specifically about MAU trends into the third quarter?
Jack Dorsey
I’ll kick it off. I would say that Twitter is unique in the sense that it has a potential to really reach a global audience and every individual in the world and provide value to every individual in the world. And we certainly have content and tweets that will be relevant to every particular person in the world for different reasons.
I think one of the goals we should always be mindful of is how do we not just increase that reach, but also increase participation. How do we show a path towards participating more with the tweets than participating more with the service and enabling more and more conversation on the platform.
One of the things that’s really unique about what we have is we have some of the best live content in the world, but at the same time we provide a venue for conversation around it. And that venue is both in public conversation and also in private conversation through direct messages. So we certainly want to amplify that and we think there’s value all along the path from just purely consuming tweets and reading tweets all the way to engaging and then ideally tweeting yourself and participating in those conversations more deeply. So that’s what we’re focused on doing and we believe there’s a whole lot of value there.
Anthony Noto
One additional thing I’d say, Anthony. You asked a question how that focus impacts our marketing plans. We do LTVs, lifetime value analysis, on users by market. We’ve identified eight growth markets, we’re focused on those growth markets based on their relative value and we will invest in marketing in each one of those eight growth markets based on lifetime value. And we’ve been doing that since last year when we started performance-based marketing.
Your second question, you asked about load factor and ad engagements. Load factor increased sequentially and year-over-year. I gave you an update on where load factor is versus our long-term opportunity to give you a sense for that. Ad engagements increased both due to load factor, but also the mix shift towards autoplay video which is a net positive.
As it relates to the MAU to DAU ratio and other factors, what I’d say is the DAU to MAU ratio has gone down over the time period that I articulated, because we’ve grown MAUs faster than DAUs and we have not historically focused on driving daily active user growth. And that’s something in 2016 that we will consider more.
As it relates to MAU trends in the third quarter, listen, we wanted to give you a very clear articulation of the opportunity we have in front of us. It’s an opportunity to close the gap between penetration at less than 30% and awareness at 95%. And we couldn’t be more excited about the opportunity to really leverage what we think is the best real-time content in the world to simplify the product so that value could be achieved and then to stream from the building tops on that value proposition and bring people to the product.
But in the near term, our organic growth is going to be very low as it was this quarter and as I think about Q3 it’s marginally better, but I wouldn’t want you to or anyone else to expect a change in our growth rate relative to what you are seeing in this quarter. I think you’ll see that for a while and that was my point.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak
I have two. Anthony, is there any way you can quantify or help us better understand how the CPX transition impacted the growth and pricing versus ad engagements in the load factor in the quarter and how do see that flowing through in the second half of the year in the guidance?
And then the second one, Jack, just going back to the MAU deep dive that you talked about, what has surprised you most since you’ve been getting under the hood on the MAU base and the MAU growth so far and which demos or age groups do you see as the biggest opportunity or the lowest hanging fruit to go after to really grow the MAUs from here?
Anthony Noto
In terms of your first question, objective-based pricing you referred to as CPX, that became generally available to everyone in May. The beta on it was pretty broad. So it’s now generally available to everyone. We saw nice improvements in CPE. We had articulated to you last quarter that we were driving the engagement metric lower in the funnel, the acquisition funnel by giving advertisers a specific vehicle that they were optimizing for, i.e., an objective.
And so we saw nice improvements in CPE this quarter to get us back to our overall CPM where we would have wanted to be after making that investment. So we are encouraged by the trend in CPE as well as the improvement in ROI for the advertiser. In the second half of the year, I would say our outlook reflects the combination of that factor as well as other initiatives we have as it relates to targeting creative and measurement.
Jack Dorsey
No real surprises. They’ve been fairly close to the business. Again, as I’ve spent the last few weeks really considering what’s in front of us and what the present state is and the future, it’s really around lining our execution and simplifying the service and making sure we’re communicating the why of the service more. But we are communicating that to a very, very broad base.
We do think Twitter and everything found within Twitter has mainstream appeal and not targeting particular demographics. One of the benefits is that we do carry every type of event in the world. So you will definitely see us amplify more of those events as they happen and they will certainly target into particular demographics around those events, but we’re going to make that call as those events happen and as we can really understand how we can share that value and then immediately get people into the service and realize it too.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post
Two questions. My first is either for Jack or Anthony. Just your strategy to get Twitter to the mass market, I guess what data or what gives you confidence that Twitter is right for the mass market? Obviously a lot of us on this call use Twitter, but just thinking about the mass market use case, what gives you confidence there?
And then in the second half of the year, if usage and user growth is going to be somewhat slow relative to prior years, what is really going to drive the quarter over quarter revenue growth besides just normal seasonality? What are some of the things you’re excited about for the second half revenue drivers?
Jack Dorsey
In terms of your first question, Justin, the reason why we’re so confident that we can reach the mass market is there’s two things that are required to get there. One, articulating a clear value, what Twitter provides, why should people pick Twitter versus all their other choices. And two, delivering that value and their expectations of the value when they get to the product.
What we start with is great brand awareness. Second, we just have to clearly communicate that value. Third, what we have that people want is this best real-time content in the world and ability to participate with our real-time content. So there’s not an asset that we need to go get. There’s not a component or value that we have to need to go get. We know we have the value that they want. It’s one, communication, which Jack and I mentioned, and two, it’s about making the product simple and easy to use. And I think you’ll see from Project Lightning that we’ve made it very simple.
Users will show up. The content will be curated. It will be curated by editors that are picking the best of the tweets that we have on a daily basis which is a massive number of pieces of content of what’s most relevant in the world and we will give individual consumers an opportunity to see the world now on Twitter. And so we have to do two things. One, clearly state the value, and two, organize and deliver in a way that is an experience that they’ve experienced at other places.
We’ve seen other products that have had the issue crossing the chasm make that transition quite easily. E-commerce and Amazon is one example. Cell phone is another example. But there are many other companies that haven’t been able to do it because they had a structural problem. In the e-commerce space, there has been some brands that really only a third of the people that buy online buy from these really well-known brands. Why? They don’t own the product. They don’t own customer service. They don’t own pricing. Those are the value drivers for e-commerce. Best selection. Best price. Best service.
We have the values that will cause someone to want to come to Twitter versus everyone else. Best content, ability to participate, ability to see the world. We just have to simplify that message and give it to them in a foolproof way where they just have to show up. So we don’t have any concerns if there’s a structural issue. We just have to execute with discipline and we will unlock that value for you as shareholders.
Justin Post
And then on the second half drivers of revenue, what are you kind of most optimistic about?
Jack Dorsey
We’re very excited about having the TellApart business which will really focus on DR and the retail category which we have been underpenetrated in. I’m also excited about the marketing that we will do in the second half of the year that is implied in our guidance. For the first time, we will have an integrated marketing plan in the US behind the launch of Project Lightning which will communicate that clear value I just talked about. And we’ll see how well the product delivers against that.
Additionally, we talked about continuing to expand the relationship with Google from a distribution standpoint to other countries with English language and to other platforms like the desktop. And then third-party attribution is another contributor to that. We also have some product roadmap plans as it relates to monetization and specific things focused on targeting creative and measurement. And really lifting, raising the bar in that area to better meet the needs of advertisers. So a lot of stuff in the second half as it relates to both users, partners and advertisers.
Krista Bessinger
We will take the next question from Periscope. And the question is, how do you plan to monetize Periscope, which is the next big thing?
Jack Dorsey
I definitely agree that Periscope is the next big thing. But we have no plans to share around monetizing it just yet. One of the amazing things about what we’ve done with Twitter and what the team has really pushed is the monetization fits perfectly within the service and actually makes the service better. So we’re always looking for opportunities to do more of that and we would hold the same high bar to what we do with Periscope and with related properties like Vine.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo.
Peter Stabler
Two, if I could. First of all, the 100,000 advertiser count is pretty impressive. I think the last time you gave it to us, it was around 60,000. So at a high level, two ways to increase your ad revenues, one, bring in new customers, two, grow your wallet share of existing customers. Wondering if you could comment on the later? Those who have been on the platform for a while, how are you doing there in terms of growing your wallet share. And then secondly, wondering if you could give us an update on commerce initiatives and what kind of consumer appetite you’re seeing for transactions on the platform?
Anthony Noto
In terms of the number of advertisers, we’re fortunate that we’re benefiting from the growth in both, both the number of advertisers and spend per advertiser. If you think about the pyramid at the top of the pyramid, our branded advertisers, what we refer to as a DSO channel, we’re really fortunate that we cracked the nut on how to deliver value to DSO or branded advertisers very early on. So it’s our most mature channel. But we’re still seeing growth there in both the number of advertisers as well as spend per advertiser.
At the bottom of the pyramid revenues being driven more by penetration of these new SMB advertisers than it is [buying rate]. But over time, we do think we’ll also have the benefit of an increased spending rate, so to speak, not buying rate, by the advertisers as it relates to SMB. So it depends on what type of advertiser you’re talking about that’s predominantly driving it. But we are overall benefitting from both.
Jack Dorsey
On the commerce side, it is still super early for this product, but a lot of our focus has been around making tweets more relevant and delivering more relevant tweets faster to people. And as we do that everything within the action, within the tweet action benefits including something like commerce.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO.
Dan Salmon
Jack, you recently launched a product around event targeting and I know that’s been an area where advertisers take a real long look and use Twitter a great deal. It looks like that helps automate that process around some of the bigger events, World Cup, Olympics and otherwise. Could you maybe tell us a little bit more about the roadmap you see for that product? And in particular, is it the type thing where if an event is more of a breaking event where it might be able to be applied and help advertisers automate that process a little bit more where they’re trying to get engagement around that specific event and subject?
Jack Dorsey
So one of the biggest things that we’ve always seen on Twitter and be really successful on the platform is around events and the engagement around events and certainly we’re going to make sure that we’re building more and more tools to target, to allow people to target these events faster. But these are still super, super early and something we need to learn a lot more from.
Dan Salmon
If I could just have one quick follow up on TellApart for Anthony. The focus on it so far has been around increasing the DR demand on Twitter. Take a step back, do you see that as a tool that advertisers are going to be able to use more broadly as a buy side tool? Obviously, you mentioned some move away from some inventory from competitors, but is that just simply a DR tool to buy on Twitter as you see it or is it a broader one that advertisers are going to be able to use across the web?
Anthony Noto
First what I’d say is TellApart is a great standalone business and that’s the first question we have to answer when we acquire a business. Josh and his team have built a really successful standalone business. It’s been primarily focused on the retail category.
All I’m simply saying is when they source inventory, they source it from a number of different platforms. It has historically not been sourced from Twitter. And so it’s important that as we think about our outlook and as we integrate some of that demand into the Twitter platform that we understand the value that’s created and there’s an investment we’re going to make in the third quarter to start that process and it’s not all completely in our control. So that’s reflected in our guidance and that’s why I made the comment specifically about the 3Q trend versus 2Q trend.
Longer-term, the reason we bought the business was, one, it is a great standalone business, but two, it gives us increased capabilities in the DR category in retail, but we could leverage the broader platform of inventory that we have at Twitter, but we also could leverage the broader platform of demand that we have at Twitter to expand geographically TellApart’s business and also expand in vertical categories. So it’s a holistic strategy. It’s not just about using it as a DSP into Twitter, that’s one small component.
Krista Bessinger
We have time for one last question which we will take from Twitter and then turn it over to Jack for his closing remarks. The last question from Twitter comes from the account of [David Clinch] who asks how much of a role will human curation play in new Twitter products and services?
Jack Dorsey
It’s a great question and something we’re still learning and playing with internally and there’s going to be a balance. The general answer is where it matters and we certainly are going to benefit from that curation and from people looking at the content and looking at our tweets and making sure that we’re constructing the right experience around it, but we’re still finding that balance and we’re going to do our work to make sure it feels great before we launch this.
Krista Bessinger
And then back to you Jack for your closing remarks.
Jack Dorsey
Thank you all for your time. In closing, I’ve never been more sure of the value Twitter brings to people and to our world. People trust us to carry some of the most important conversations, commentary, critique, events, ideas and questions in the world. I’m focused on raising the bar of our execution so we can serve people better and faster and build a company that empowers generation after generation. I want to thank you all for your time, your support and we’ll see you all on Twitter. Thank you.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Twitter first quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Krista Bessinger, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks Patrick and good afternoon. Welcome to our Q1 earnings call and thanks for joining us.
We have with us today our CEO, Dick Costolo; and CFO, Anthony Noto. We will begin with approximately 20 minutes of prepared remarks followed by Q&A. During the Q&A, we will take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the #TWTRearnings.
Before covering the Safe Harbor, as you undoubtedly know by now, this afternoon's planned announcement of the quarterly results was prematurely disclosed. We asked the New York stock exchange to halt trading once we discovered our Q1 numbers were out and we published our results as soon as possible thereafter. Selerity, who provided the initial tweets with our results informed us that earnings release was available on our Investor Relations site before the close of market. NASDAQ hosts our manages our IR website and we explicitly instructed them not to release our results until after the market close and only upon our specific instructions, which is consistent with prior quarters. We are continuing to investigate with them exactly what occurred.
Moving on to the Safe Harbor. We would like remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call, such as our outlook for Q2 and 2015 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our earnings release. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. And finally, an audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Dick Costolo.
Dick Costolo
Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have a lot to cover with you. So we will jump right in. We finished the quarter with mixed financial results and solid operational performance. Total revenue was $436 million, up 74% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $104 million, which represents a 24% margin, up 182% year-over-year and we surpassed 300 million monthly active users with 302 million monthly active users reported for Q1.
After five consecutive quarters of more than 97% year-over-year revenue growth, we underperformed against our expectations. We anticipate the factors that affected our first quarter results will also affect our 2015 guidance. While I am disappointed we didn't continue to exceed expectations on revenue, I am proud of the teams focus, innovation and energy around the way we managed the business in light of the shortfall. In particular, it's reassuring to see we could still exceed our profitability targets and make the strategic investments we had planned in the quarter despite the revenue headwind. Anthony will share a lot more details on our financials and key factors impacting them later on the call.
Also relevant to revenue, we just this afternoon announced our agreement to acquire TellApart, a leading marketing technology company providing retailers and e-commerce advertisers with valuable direct response marketing capabilities. TellApart joining Twitter gives us additional tools for cross device identity, targeting and attribution, along with a very talented and deep direct response expertise and team. Anthony will also provide more details on that.
As we work toward our mission to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers, we continue to focus on our three objectives. One, strengthen Twitter's core. Two, remove barriers to consumption. And three, build new applications and services to increase Twitter as a utility across the world. As I have highlighted repeatedly in the past, product innovation and execution are vital as they will be the drivers of growth long-term and the velocity and quality of work I am seeing continues to improve as we continue to make it a focus. There is incredible unique content on Twitter and our opportunity is to make sure people see something awesome every time they open their phone. We are getting more adept at delivering relevant tweets and content to people in a way that makes their experience with Twitter better and more engaging and I will talk more about that work today.
Our first objective, strengthening Twitter's core, represents are focused to increase the number of logged in users and their daily Twitter use by increasing engagement and improving retention. I have talked in the past about some work we are doing to accomplish this, including providing more ways to share and see rich media, improving the new user experience and group messaging. Let me first provide an update on our efforts around the new user experience and how we are moving forward with that work and then I will discuss a new feature we recently launched on Android called highlights.
To grow our user base, we need to improve new user retention and our strategy here is to provide immediate value and a compelling timeline the moment a user signs up. I talked last quarter about the experiments we were running to test instant timelines. They reduce the time and work necessary to get a great experience on Twitter by giving new users a rich personalized timeline immediately even if they don't follow any accounts during the sign-up process. We have now launched instant timelines on iOS and Android and soon will be testing them on the web. I expect just iterate frequently on instant timelines over the coming months based on the data we are seeing from its use. The results during our experiment were quite positive in terms of engagement and neutral on retention. This is a learning product, as I have mentioned before and we see the opportunity to increase retention alongside the positive results and engagement.
We launched another new mechanism to immediately deliver compelling content to users the moment we have it. Today, the main place people consume tweets is through their home timeline and we want to break out of that context to deliver tweets to people in a way that makes Twitter fits effortlessly into their lives. You can see this work through a feature we recently introduced on Android called highlights. It brings you a summary of the best tweets tailored for you via push notification letting you quickly catch up with what's happening in your world. One of my favorite things about highlights is its new user interface where people are just swiping back and forth between these tweets. Through instant timelines and now highlights we offer people compelling content as soon as they sign up while also creating mechanisms that drive people back to Twitter and show them engaging content right away.
Next, I want to talk about our second objective, remove barriers to consumption. There is great content on Twitter for everyone and we need to bring that to people immediately and frictionlessly wherever they are and however they come to the platform. I will start with an update on the while you were away function which we call recap internally for short. We are seeing perhaps the most exciting results here. Recap brings to the top of your timeline some of the best tweets you missed from accounts you follow while you were away from Twitter. These tweets are not only seeing high engagement, they are bringing people back to Twitter more frequently. Importantly, the machine learning work we are doing for recap is helping us make these algorithms better and driving continuous improvements and engagement, so we are going to double down on recap because of the success we are having here.
Second, just a couple weeks ago we launched the first version of our logged out home page. Every month, as we have described for you, there are more than half billion people who visit Twitter but don't login. By organizing our content in a way that's easily discovered and consumed, we extend the reach of Twitter far beyond the 302 million people who log in every month. We first introduced the logged out home page on desktop in the U.S. and we intend to bring it more places over time, while also iterating on it and making improvements that keep it informative, entertaining and relevant.
On our last earnings call, I talked about the work we are doing to better organize content to deliver a great experience to our total audience. The logged out home page and recap along with the ongoing work we have been doing to make profiles more compelling for people who aren't logged in are just three examples of how we can translate that work into a visible delightful experience.
Our third and final objective is to build new applications and services in order to increase Twitter's utility around the world. I am going to focus today on Periscope specifically and our mobile video efforts more broadly. About one month ago, we introduced Periscope providing people with a way to share, watch and be an active participant in immersive live video experiences directly from their phones. Like Twitter, Periscope enables people to connect to what's happening in their world and it actually takes that connection to an entirely new level.
By transporting you into people's lives, you can now jump into the life of a Paris ballet director, you can see what he sees, hear him speak to his dancers and you can communicate with him as a moment in his day unfolds. Then second later, you can be walking the streets of Seoul with a woman who is showing her friends the city. We have seen tremendous early growth on Periscope. In just the first 10 days alone, more than 1 million people signed into the app and even more have tuned in to live broadcast through the web. This is possible because broadcasters on Periscope can share their Periscopes to Twitter to reach a larger audience.
As we have explained in the past, we know that rich media like photos and videos are some of the most engaging content on the platform and that's why we have also brought native mobile video to both iOS and Android in Q1 and now along with Periscope and Vine, there are even more ways for Twitter users to watch mobile videos within the Twitter ecosystem. When we first saw Periscope in late 2014, we were excited about it for a number of reasons, but mostly because it so nicely fits into our mission to give people the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers.
The same was true for Vine and with both of these products, we now have a suite of mobile apps, including two of the most powerful native mobile video apps and are well positioned as more and more people turn to video as a way to express themselves, share what's happening around them, connect with others and view content they enjoy. From casual users to content creators who are building a career through mobile video, we will deliver products and services that fit their needs and a public platform that can help them build an audience and reach more people.
With the addition of Niche, there is an opportunity for new and emerging professional creators to connect with brands and build their careers. When we combine our native mobile video apps and related services like Niche with the awesome distribution power of Twitter across our total global audience, we offer creators the best way to make incredible videos reach the largest possible audience and build and grow at a career in the Twitter ecosystem.
To close out, I continue to be happy with both the improved velocity and quality of the product releases as we continue to provide tools to create and share media, make it easier for people to get immediate value out of the product, no matter where or how they access Twitter and provide new applications that broaden the reach an appeal of Twitter's products, we make Twitter richer, easier, better and bigger.
And with that, I will turn it over to Anthony to go deeper into the financials.
Anthony Noto
Thank you, Dick and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss our financial and operating performance for Q1 and provide guidance for Q2 and update our outlook for fiscal year 2015. Q1 was another quarter of significant growth for Twitter.
Total revenue reached $436 million, an increase of 74% year-over-year on a reported basis. Using constant currency, year-over-year total revenue growth in Q1 was 80%. Ad revenue reached $380 million, up 72% year-over-year on a reported basis, or up 78% year-over-year using constant currency. Ad revenue growth was driven by strong year-over-year growth in the number of advertisers on Twitter across all channels. From a product perspective, year-over-year growth was primarily driven by newer products specifically Promoted Video ads and Website Cards.
However, while growth was strong, some of our direct response products fell short of our expectations for Q1. Two factors impacted the results. First, some advertisers limited spending at higher levels of scale because the bids required to win incremental auctions were higher than they were willing to pay, which limited additional spending. Second, we have improved the quality of leads for direct response advertisers using our Website Cards by raising the bar on what constitutes an engagement or click. The higher bar provides significantly increased value to advertisers because we are delivering users further down the marketing funnel.
Today, this results in a lower click through rate and less revenue for Twitter. However longer term, we expect the higher ROI that advertisers are getting from these higher-quality leads to result in CPE's that more than offset the lower click through rate we are seeing today. As a result of these two factors, revenue in the first quarter came in 2% below the midpoint of our previously forecasted range. We expect these factors to carry over into Q2, with improvement in the second half of the year. To deliver increased value at scale, we remain focused on providing improved targeting, measurement and creative for direct response advertisers, which we expect will help improve quality scores by improving click through probability and thus less dependence on bid buys to clear auctions at higher levels of scale.
Taking a step back, it's important to emphasize that we are still in the very early stages of development for direct response products, as most of them have been available for less than one year. We are very encouraged by the growth we have experienced thus far, but as often is the case with new products, we have a great deal of iterating and fine-tuning to do as we scale in order to maximize the effectiveness of these products in our complex marketplaces. To be clear, there has been no change for a multi-year view of a growth opportunity for advertising on Twitter. We will continue to innovate and are confident we will improve the product to better meet the needs of direct response advertisers over time.
An important step in improving these areas is our acquisition of TellApart announced today. The acquisition of TellApart provides immediate meaningful benefits across targeting, measurement and creative for direct response advertisers in the retail vertical category and we will extend these capabilities internationally into other verticals over time.
Now moving on to additional highlights from the quarter. By channel, direct sales was once again the largest contributor to year-over-year dollar growth on an absolute basis in Q1. Our SMB channel was again the fastest-growing channel year-over-year with a meaningful uptick in the number of advertisers added sequentially. Looking across products, we continue to see meaningful contributions from products launched less than 12 months ago. Promoted Video was a significant driver of year-over-year ad revenue growth and was up nicely on a quarter-over-quarter basis as well. Our direct response products including mobile application download or maps and Website Cards were the largest contributors in absolute dollars to year-over-year growth in Q1, although these products did see their first decline in revenue on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to the reasons I covered earlier.
In terms of geographies, in Q1 U.S. ad revenue grew 59% year-over-year while international ad revenue grew 103% year-over-year and accounted for 35% of total ad revenue. Data licensing and other revenue contributed $48 million in the quarter, an increase of 95% year-over-year.
Moving on to cost and EBITDA. In Q1, total non-GAAP expenses were $389 million, up 57% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by headcount and related overhead costs as well as an investment in infrastructure and sales and marketing. We continue to invest in our workforce across all functions to scale our business and total headcount reached approximately 3,900 employees at the end of the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $104 million, an increase of 182% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for Q1 was 24% versus 15% in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA outperformed our expectations due to lower G&A expenses and reduced commissions. It's important to know, we are still able to make the investments we have planned for Q1 and exceed our EBITDA expectations despite the revenue underperformance.
Moving on. Non-GAAP net income was $47 million in the first quarter, up from approximately breakeven the same period a year ago. Our GAAP net loss in Q1 was $162 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.07 per share, while GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.25 per share.
Before turning to metrics, I will cover a few items related to cash and CapEx. We ended Q1 with roughly $3.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. Cash from operations was positive $92 million and CapEx was $73 million.
Now I would like to turn to our operating metrics. On users, average monthly active users reached 302 million for the quarter reflecting year-over-year growth of 18%. U.S. MAUs increased to over 65 million for the period and international MAUs grew to 236 million. Please note given our prioritization of emerging markets as a growth vehicle, we are now delivering a more complete experience to users we define as SMS fast followers. These are users who sign up and access Twitter solely via SMS. As we now have specific initiatives in place to grow and monetize this user base, we will begin counting SMS fast followers and our total MAU count going forward.
The number of SMS fast followers in the quarter was approximately six million. For clarity, this was not included in the reported MAU number of 302 million. Including SMS fast followers in each period, total MAUs in Q1 reached 308 million versus 258 million in the same period of 2014, reflecting an MAU increase with SMS fast followers of 19% year-over-year. Please see our supplemental slides on our investor relations website, where we provide the historical breakout for this group of users over the last five quarters for comparison purposes. In future periods, we will focus on MAUs including SMS fast followers when we report.
Turning now to monetization metrics. In Q1 year-over-year ad revenue growth of 72% was driven by both an increase in ad engagements and CPE. Ad engagements grew 32% year-over-year driven by both an increase in our load as well as audience. Cost per ad engagement or CPE grew 30% year-over-year due to both a continued mix shift to higher priced ad units as well as increases in same format CPE for the majority of ad types.
Now I will turn to our guidance. As previously mentioned, we expect the factors which led to our marginally solid growth in Q1 to continue for the full year of 2015. For Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $470 million to $485 million and adjusted EBITDA to be $97 million to $102 million. I say again, adjusted EBITDA to be $97 million to $102 million. We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $190 million to $200 million. Finally, we expect the share count for Q2 to be approximately 660 million shares on a GAAP basis and the fully diluted share count to be a proxy 700 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. Please note that our guidance includes TellApart and it assumes a close of June 1, 2015.
For the full year 2015, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $2.17 billion to $2.27 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be $510 million to $535 million. We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $750 million to $790 million.
With that, we are ready to take questions. Operator, will you please announce the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two. I want to understand, digging a little bit on the direct response side, understand a little bit better when you saw advertisers responding to price or what they are seeing in terms of ROIs in the marketplace? What sort of feedback you have got from investors since then? And how do you think some of the changes you are making with TellApart might change that discussion with advertisers? And then, Anthony, maybe on TellApart, just any sense you can give us of what it would contribute to the guidance that you have given with the June 1 close?
Dick Costolo
Sure. In terms of the revenue shortfall, it was directly attributed to direct response and it was directly attributed to demand as opposed to supply. As I said in the script, as advertisers scale their spending, as they retire levels of spending, they weren't willing to increase their quality score on an adjusted bid basis to get to the next level of supply to clear the auction.
Additionally, we have moved web-based direct response products, Website Cards, from a CPE pricing mechanism and engaging mechanism to a CPX pricing mechanism. And what that means, under CPE there is four different ways to drive engagement to drive a click and to get paid. Under CPX there is only one way to drive a click through rate that we get paid for.
And what we are doing is adding significant value to these advertisers by delivering them leads that are further down the marketing funnel and that lowers click through rate because it's a much higher bar to drive an engagement, ultimately drives up higher ROI and that is resulting in great value for advertisers, lower revenue for us. But we are already seeing some improvement in the CPE the advertisers are willing to pay and we do believe, over time, that CPE will continue to increase until it actually offsets the decline in CTR. So those are the two factors.
What are we focused on? As it relates to direct response, we are focused on three things that we talked about before and I will give you some specifics, targeting, measurement and creative. As it relates to targeting, we are improving our cross device ID capabilities, which is an important element to driving optimization and our ability to target and drive better ROI. Application graph targeting is another feature that we have recently rolled out and we become more pervasive. That's the ability to look at a user's smartphone, understand what applications they have and target based on complementary applications or if someone is not active on an application using an re-engagement approach as opposed to an install approach. Then better prediction models. Today, we have prediction capabilities as it relates to click through rates and we will increasingly move to prediction ability as it relates to actual conversion.
From a measuring standpoint, we announced today a third-party attribution deal with DoubleClick and this is an important development that allows advertisers to not only understand the return that they are driving through attribution from Twitter but also from attribution information from a third party like DoubleClick. It's an important step forward for us as it relates to measurement and an important functionality that our advertisers have asked for and we will continue to get on the path to partner with other third-party attribution models as well.
The second thing under measurement that will incrementally add throughout the year is conversion lift studies and the ability to A/B test driving a lift through different measurements and different formats.
And then lastly on the creative side, we rolled out through in March carousel formats. Today, that carousel format is only being used for map, mobile application downloads. It's an ability in one slot to give multiple choices to the user from a mobile application standpoint and we think it has great prospects to driving better performance for the advertiser overall.
And then lastly, TellApart really accelerates our capabilities in all of these different areas, targeting, measurement and creative. We couldn't be more excited to have Josh and the TellApart team to be part of the Twitter team and we are excited to get started.
The last thing I would leave you with is that the issues we would characterize as growing pains, they are adjustable over time. We couldn't be more confident about the growth opportunity that we have in front of us, at least for advertising. So we are quite excited.
In terms of your second question, TellApart in our guidance, we are not breaking out TellApart in our guidance from the standpoint it's not material. What I will tell you is we are excited about having the team. We are working to close the deal by June 1. The TellApart business is dependent on third-party publisher inventory. There will be a migration of that over time and that will impact the ultimate revenue that we drive from TellApart. So those of you that may have had a relationship with Josh and his team as a public company, you have to factor that into how you think about the contribution of its revenue to our overall revenue as this third party inventory migration.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for the color.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. Operator, we are ready for the next question please.
Operator
The next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler
Thanks. I guess, a question for Anthony and then one for Dick. Just a little more clarity on the revenue guidance. So if we cannot back out the impact from the World Cup that you called out from last year, that implies about 60%, plus or minus, ad revenue growth for the second quarter and around the same for the back half. So I guess the question is, given how low the ad load is, why are you guys not seeing higher growth rates? And what's the constraint? Are you onboarding new advertisers at a similar rate or higher? And then, for TellApart, is there a high overlap between Twitter's advertisers and those that are running on TellApart? And then Dick, just a quick one on Periscope. Any update on total number of users or any metrics you guys are willing to provide? I know it's early. Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Sure. Thank you. So in terms of guidance, we obviously missed first quarter revenue by 2% relative to the midpoint of our guidance range and so if you keep the quarter-over-quarter sequential growth rates constant to where they would have been implied by our original guidance, the full-year should be down by 2%. Obviously, it's down by, I think, 4.5% relative to the midpoint of our guidance. The delta between the 2% and the 4.5% is due to two factors. One, we have lowered the sequential growth rates to factor in a degree of risk that we now recognize from Q1 related to DR. We do think the initiatives that I mentioned will drive strong performance. We are expecting that to come more in the back half of the year than in the second quarter, but the quarter-over-quarter growth rates were lowered to add in some risk there. Second factor is currency. It's not a big factor, but it also factored into lower quarter-over-quarter growth rates. As it relates to TellApart, there is very little overlap in the advertiser base.
Dick Costolo
Hi, Ross, it's Dick. On Periscope, I don't have any additional data to give you other than what I mentioned in my opening remarks. In the first 10 days, more than million people logging into the app. I will just add this additional color. I keep talking about native mobile video and what I mean by that is video produced primarily for mobile consumption. We saw last night with the events in Baltimore, if you happen to be on Periscope, it's absolutely riveting and when we are able to organize these experiences that people are distributing to our ecosystem, whether it by Vine or Periscope or Twitter itself and deliver those experiences to logged out users and in syndication, I am just super excited and confident about the ability to grow that Periscope user base.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thanks. Ready for the next question, operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is open.
Anthony DiClemente
Hi, thanks. A couple questions for Anthony. Just if you can give us a little bit more around your expectation for the MAU trajectory over the next few quarters? Should we continue to expect something in that mid-teens MAU add range and what are the drivers? And then secondly, wondering on the direct response piece, what percentage of your ad spend is direct response to begin with, Anthony? And how has that changed in the last few quarters? And just on a percentage of revenue basis, can you help us with how you expect that to change? And then finally monetization of the logged out users, that seems to remain a major opportunity. Any color on when we could start to see the fruits of your partnerships with Google and so forth, Flipboard, Yahoo! Japan work themselves into the revenue numbers? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
MAUs, the 302 million monthly active users that we reported without SMS follows in Q1 was driven by growth initiatives and a return to organic and seasonal growth and we had the benefit of all those factors working for us as we delivered that number. In Q2, we are not seeing the benefit from those three factors as much and there is also some headwinds. So at this point our visibility is actually limited as it relates to Q2 MAU adds. We are off to a slow start in April and so the visibility is not as strong as it was in Q1 and the trend is not similar to Q1.
Your second question is what percent of revenue came from DR. DR revenue, as a percent of total revenue, is increasing. That said, our direct sales organization which is generally characterized as branded advertisers is still more than 50% of our overall revenue. It's not growing as fast as DR. So DR is increasing as a percent of revenue, but the branded advertising trend is very strong. It was strong in the quarter and continues to be strong.
Additionally Ross had asked the question about our advertiser growth. Our advertiser growth, year-over-year, in the first quarter is very similar to our advertiser growth year-over-year in Q4, which is another indicator of the broad-based growth that we have in both areas from advertisers.
And then as it relates logged out, I am going to pass it over to Dick.
Dick Costolo
Yes. So I will speak broadly about the two fundamental questions we want to address with our product changes which are, why should I use Twitter and how do I use Twitter. We have launched version one of two products here that we think answer those questions. The logged out experience delivers that immediate value to people who come to Twitter and when people see compelling content there, they quickly understand the value they can get from Twitter and why they should use it.
And then secondly, instant timelines removes that friction and shows people how to use Twitter, making it much more immediately delightful and compelling. These are both V1 products. As I have mentioned before, we are going to iterate on them rapidly and frequently before we worry about introducing monetization into things like the logged out experience. And I highlight that a V1 products and iteration because for example, when we first launched ad targeting, we iterated on that regularly in order to get it to the place it was even six months after we launched it and it's certainly much, much different now and I am confident we will do the same with the logged out experience and instant timeline and other initiatives.
Additionally as it relates to the Google deal, I would highlight several things. One, that will be rolling out in May. I don't have a specific date for you, but now I can at least give you a specific month. And that Google deal is all about, that relationship is about driving our total audience strategy. The goal is that people consume content and engage with that content whether they log in or not.
And finally, we are also working with Apple to surface great Twitter content and accounts directly in Spotlight Search on iOS and OS X, that also makes it easier and quicker to find great things on Twitter. So I would sum up by saying, there is absolutely an opportunity to go and monetize that attention and traffic. We want to make sure we iterate on the experiences to get them right first.
Got it. Thank you very much.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thanks and we are going to take the next question from Twitter. From the Twitter account of Rich Greenfield at BTIG and he asks, should Twitter curate content for logged in users the way you are doing for logged out? Is this a priority?
Dick Costolo
Yes. So just following up, thanks Rich, first of all, I am just following up on my last answer. As we iterate on the logged out experience and curate topics, events, moments that unfold on the platform, you should absolutely expect us to deliver those experiences across the total audience and that includes logged in users and users in syndication.
Krista Bessinger
And next question from the phone please, operator.
Operator
The next question comes from Paul Vogel with Barclays. Your line is open.
Paul Vogel
Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. One, first, just on the logged out users, Anthony, just was there anything expected in the guidance that you are now adjusting based on monetizing the logged out users? Second questions is on the direct response, I know app installs have been a big driver across the web. Any commentary on app installs in particular and how they have worked on Twitter? And then just last, I think you guys mentioned in terms of churn that the instant timeline and other new features have sort of been neutral on retention. Is there any commentary on churn overall not just on new users but older users and whether or not users who come on based on events, whether it's World Cup or Super Bowl, churn at a different rate than users who come on for other reasons? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Thank you, Paul. In terms of logged out users driving revenue guidance, there is not revenue in the guidance that we gave from logged out users. In terms of mobile application downloads, the business started in late July, August of last year. It's been a very good growth contributor. It is one of the DR businesses that are underperforming in the quarter, having a very strong year-over-year growth rate, but being down sequentially relative to our expectations to power through seasonality. And so that was one of the DR products that underperformed.
All the things that I mentioned before targeting, measurement and creative, apply to map as it does to DR more broadly and we are really encouraged by the signs we are seeing from carousel which is a direct format change for mobile application download.
In terms of your question on retention, overall our retention was largely the same in Q1 relative to Q4. And in terms of, do event MAU drive different levels of retention or churn, et cetera? The answer to that question is, no. We do get obviously increased activity on the platform engagement around specific events, but to tie it to a churn rate or an acquisition rate, we haven't seen that historically in a real significant way consistently across events and across newsworthy breaking real-time information.
Paul Vogel
Great. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. Next question please, operator.
Operator
The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Pitz
Thanks. Any specifics you can share of the DoubleClick deal? How much inventory will be made available? And what does the rev share look like? And also any early insights into the Flipboard and Yahoo! Japan syndication deals? And when we should see any P&L impact? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Thank you, Brian. In terms of DoubleClick deal, we are not sharing any additional information. We are really excited about third-party attribution. We think it will really help with the measurement element of DR but also optimization. In terms of the ads API that you are referring to, we are not sharing information as it relates to inventory or revenue splits.
In terms of timing of revenue from Flipboard and Yahoo! Japan, Flipboard launched in the quarter. We did see a small amount of revenue from Flipboard in the quarter and that relationship we are really excited about because we have the opportunity in Flipboard to monetize Twitter timelines of Flipboard users using Flipboard to access Twitter. And that's exciting, but it's also exciting that we have an opportunity monetize non-Twitter timeline inventory on the Flipboard.
As it relates to Yahoo! Japan, we don't have a specific launch date as it relates to monetization element of that syndication deal. But the syndication deal has been implemented and is live. The monetization element of it, because it's on web, is more complicated from a product integration standpoint.
Brian Pitz
Thanks, Anthony.
Krista Bessinger
And we will take the next question from Twitter. It comes from Bennett Sultan and here she asks, How has hiring and recruiting performed this quarter? Can you speak towards employee retention and job demand?
Dick Costolo
Thanks, Bennett. This is Dick. I would highlight that first of all, we were named to Fortune's best places to work in the first year. I believe the first year we applied to that, which was fantastic and an extraordinary achievement. So I am proud of that. And then I would say, generally look great people want to work with other great people and as I have sort of highlighted in the last couple quarters, I couldn't be happier with both the team we built out here that not only directly reports to me but that next level of leaders from across the industry who are also operating in the organization now in the engineering organization, finance, media, product, et cetera. So I think that's all having a very positive impact on the kinds of talent we are able to bring into the company.
Krista Bessinger
Great and next question from the phone line please, operator.
Operator
The next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Douglas Anmuth
Thanks for taking the question. Two things, one for Anthony and one for Dick. Just first Anthony, on the changes in engagement growth in CPE growth, some pretty big changes in trend there. I am trying to understand the detail in ad engagements, how much that is tied to exactly what you are talking about in terms of direct response? I understand the cost side is probably there in terms of the bigger growth. And then secondly, Dick, can you give us more color on video. I think the launch of native video is in January. If you can help us just understand anything, any metrics that you can share there? And what you think the awareness of native video is on the platform and levels of engagement that you have seen? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Thanks, Doug. In terms of your first question, load factor from Q4 to Q1 is relatively flat. The difference there would be lower click through rate and that's a function of a couple of factors, most importantly the mix shift towards lower click through rate formats.
Dick Costolo
Yes. And I will quantify video consumption and engagement this way. Since the launch of native mobile video on the platform on iOS and android, we have seen orders of magnitude increases in the volume of native mobile video shared to Twitter across all kinds of the video shared to Twitter, orders of magnitude increases. And again, as I have mentioned, that content is some of the most engaging on the platform in terms of favorites, retweets, clicks, et cetera. So I am delighted with that and that's how I would quantify it.
Douglas Anmuth
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. Next question please, operator.
Operator
We have Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Heath Terry
Great. Thanks. Anthony, when you referenced the rising cost of ad units as being a reason behind the slower growth and budgets, what does that say to you about the ROI that advertisers are seeing in general and maybe more specifically to the app download side of the business? And then also if you can give us an update even just qualitatively on ad load in the quarter specifically in the U.S.? Was there any contribution to the slowdown in growth related to limitations in ad load that you are starting to see?
Anthony Noto
Sure. On your first question, I specifically pointed out that advertisers didn't have high enough quality score adjusted bids, because there is two parts to that. It's both what they bid as well as the predictive click through rate and the combination of those two things. So the value that they wanted at higher levels of scale wasn't equal to what we would be able to deliver based on that quality score adjusted bids. So it could be a factor of CPE, but it also could be a low predictive click through rate which would decrease the quality score on an adjusted bid basis, even if a person had a very high CP that they bid.
In terms of your broader question about, are we running into a supply issue? What I would say is this, the shortfall we had in revenue in the quarter was related to demand. We don't have a supply issue today. Taking a step back from a big picture perspective, the ultimate size of our business will depend on the size of the audience that we build and that audience is broadly defined as logged in, logged out, syndicated users, Vine users and Periscope users, our ability to driving engagement with those users and then our ability to monetize products against those users.
Today, we are not inventory constrained, but we are continuously evaluating our ability to optimize the yield over inventory to make sure we are driving value for both the user as well as the advertiser, So today, it is really demand issue. We will continue to evaluate over time .But that's what the issue is today.
Our load factor relative to what we talked about in November from an opportunity of 5%, we are not close to 5% today. We are meaningfully below that.
Heath Terry
And that's in both, U.S. and international?
Anthony Noto
Yes, the 5% that I am referencing and where we are in load factor is an aggregate worldwide reference. We haven't broken out load factor by U.S. or by international, nor by heavy, medium or light users. They all obviously vary by market and by type of user.
Heath Terry
Great. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
I will take the next question from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of Victor Anthony and he asks, how does this new risk impact how you think about your annualized revenue potential as you laid it out at Analyst day.
Anthony Noto
Thank you, Victor. We couldn't be more confident in the opportunity ahead of us and the team that we have going after it. So no change relative to the opportunity that we talked about at Analyst Day. I would say this is typical growing pains where product that's less than 12 months old. We have a seasoned group of executives that have built DR at other companies that you are familiar with that have been very successful and growing their businesses to over two million advertisers. We still believe we have that same opportunity. We are still in the tens of thousands of advertisers realm and we still think threw is an opportunity to be able to build our DR business to be as effective and capture the opportunity that we had laid out at Analyst Day and the drivers that we talked about previously.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Operator, we will take our next question from the phone line, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Your line is open.
Brian Wieser
Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to take another attack at the DoubleClick question. Without getting into the financial specifics, I was just curious if you can say when that integration might begin? And if it will be possible to track impressions or just clicks? And separately, just curious about what this might mean in terms of plans to integrate with other ad servers and other DSPs?
Dick Costolo
Sure. I appreciate why you are asking the questions on DoubleClick, but we really value the relationship with Google. This is the second major deal we have announced with them. Our search deal will be rolling out in May and we are really excited about that. This DoubleClick deal was just signed recently and the specific plans, we will share with you later as they become more visible and we are comfortable sharing with you.
In terms of what we get from a data standpoint and from a revenue standpoint, we are not sharing that information. It's obviously competitive and information we are not going to share publicly.
Brian Wieser
And in terms of working with other, can be management tools or other DSPs? Is that something you can comment on?
Dick Costolo
We are talking to other third-party attribution partners and we are excited about the opportunity to move beyond just DoubleClick to give our advertisers exactly what they want from a measurement capability and third-party attribution is a key to that. So we want to give them a full 360 degree view, Twitter, DoubleClick and other major third-party attribution platforms.
Brian Wieser
Great. Thank you very much.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And next question please, operator.
Operator
We have Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Ron Josey
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little more about product and specifically we noticed a big cadence in terms of product launches and so, one in particular was interesting around group direct messaging. Just wondering if since the launch you have seen an engagement grow on that product and if you are finding users prefer to talk to via groups or via the traditional open web or open Twitter? Is that another way for those user that use group, do they tend post as much outside as they did inside of the group? Thanks. Appreciate it.
Dick Costolo
Sure. Hi, Ron, this is Dick. Thanks for that question. I would say that we have definitely seen an increase in use of direct messaging with the combined launches of group DM and the share tweet functionality, being able to take the public conversation to a private channel. I don't know that I would characterize the growth or increase in engagement as specifically attributable to one or the other. There is kind of a mix and match, if you will. In other words, what I mean by that is, there is an increase in engagement of the people who are using DM to take a public conversation to a private channel with just one other person, but that's also part of what's compelling group private conversations. In other words, people taking a public tweet into a private room with a group of users and having a private back and forth about the public conversation. So sort of a long way of saying, I think it's the combination of those two together that's really responsible for the growth, not one or the other.
And specific to your question about, do they post more publicly or chat more privately in groups, I don't have any data for you on that. What I will say about DMs is that we will continue to iterate there and you will continue to see a cadence of launches around direct messaging that are all about letting people move fluidly between the public and private conversation.
Ron Josey
Great. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
And next question please, operator.
Operator
We have Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark Mahaney
Thanks. A question for Anthony and then a question for Dick. Anthony, can you say anything about the retention amongst advertisers? I know you mentioned that there is continued robust growth in advertisers, but are the advertisers you already have had on-site on the service on the network, is there spend retention, their ability to renew campaigns with you, has that changed? And then Dick, given the MAU trends and maybe I won't overdo is, but maybe the slowness that you are seeing going into this quarter, is there any rethink on your part in terms of being able to grow MAUs beyond just the product enhancements, but maybe considering a brand advertising campaign? Thank you.
Anthony Noto
Thank you, Mark. On a year-over-year basis, I alluded to the fact that our growth rate in total advertisers was similar in Q1 to Q4. We haven't previously talked about retention rate of advertisers or as you refer to as churn and so I would hesitate to give you that information now. We have to think through it more, so you have a clear picture. But year-over-year growth rate in the quarter was very similar to what it was in the fourth quarter.
Dick Costolo
Hi, Mark, it's Dick. As regard to your specific question about brand advertising, well I have said in the past year, is something I still strongly believe in and I think we are probably closer to it now, which is that as we get these learning products like the logged out experience and instant timeline working and iterating on them into a place where we really feel good about the kind of experiences we are dropping people into the moment they come to Twitter. Yes, you should absolutely expect us to be thinking about things like precisely that, reaching out into the market and then bringing people actively, proactively I guess is a better way to put it, into those experiences. But it will be on the heels of getting to a point where we are really happy about the way those experiences feel and the data we see from them. And I think we are a lot closer to that now.
Mark Mahaney
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And we will take the next question from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of Manish Sheth who asks, can you give insights into in-tweet purchase and what's the strategy for in-tweet purchase beyond just tickets?
Dick Costolo
Sure, I would say that it's actually the case that tickets are one of the more recent examples of in-tweet purchase we have started exploring and we will continue to run those explorations. I have highlighted in the past that it's in the moment commerce that we are particularly excited about when we think about in-tweet purchases and we continue to explore different kinds of ways of thinking about in the moment commerce. I don't have any additional plans to announce there yet.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. Operator, next question from the phone line, please.

The next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Peter Stabler
Thanks for taking the question. I guess, one for Dick and one for Anthony. Fully appreciate, I think all of us do that the timeline view metric had fully outlived its usefulness and that's great. Just wondering if you have any thoughts on how we should be thinking about monitoring engagement going forward? That's first one. And then secondly, with regard to your own analytics and measurement products, wondering if you could step back and give yourself a self-evaluation, where you think you are in the development curve of analytics on your own platform and what could we expect from a product development cycle going forward this year? Thank you.
Anthony Noto
Sure. In terms of engagement metrics, there is a lot of different metrics that we look at internally. There is not one metric for engagement. And so I can give you a sense of some of them and quite frankly, we would like to be able to give you more visibility in this, but there is just a number of different measurement. So DAU is one measurement of engagement. We talked about that at Analyst Day. It's a measurement that is dependent by market and you can have mix shift. So it could be a little bit misleading, but DAU to MAU ratios in the quarter were similar to what they were by market relative to Analyst Day.
Other engagement metrics that we look at are tweets per day, favorites and retweets, direct messages, searches. Our number of searches actually accelerated on year-over-year growth basis in the quarter. Direct messages also accelerated on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. Favorite and retweets had strong growth and we had growth in tweets per day as well. So those metrics all were generally positive.
The timeline view metric, we don't look at internally. It is a metric that we are doing things that actually hurt it and that was one of the reasons why we eliminated it. So we continue to look for metrics that could be helpful to you and we will try to give you color from time to time across these different metrics. But there is not one, the all-in metric.
Dick Costolo
Yes and Peter, this is Dick. I would say, to the analytics question, what we are really doing now, we are really focused on internally is bringing together the various analytics systems we had around measuring logged in audience, logged out audience and syndicated audience into a single system, for really understanding things like total views of a tweet across the entirety of the audience, as one example. And once we have those integrated capabilities, we will be able to highlight those to publishers and Twitter users. I think that will give people a better sense of their own total distribution across the entire ecosystem. And I am excited for us to get those wrapped up and launched.
Peter Stabler
Thank you.

The next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Ben Schachter
Anthony, you mentioned that the number of advertisers is in the tens of thousands, but I am wondering, how many advertisers do you think you will end the year with? And then separately, is it fair for us to expect that the SMS only users will monetize at significantly lower levels? And if so, why include them in the combined MAU count? And then finally, the third was, will the Periscope users will also be included in MAUs? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Sure. As it relates the number of advertisers at the end of the year, we are not providing a forecast or guidance for advertisers at year-end. As it relates to SMS fast followers, just a couple point of clarification and then to your specific question. So our MAU definition in our filings has included SMS users, but to be very clear those are users that signed up for Twitter on a client other than SMS, desktop, mobile web, the application, many other clients they could have used. And then they have chosen to get notifications or tweets sent to them via SMS. And that's different than a SMS fast follow user.
An SMS fast follow user is a user that is an emerging market. It is an important growth area for us. These SMS fast followers have only signed up for Twitter via the feature phone via SMS. And so they are getting tweets sent to them in either a list from individual followers to their feature phone. And the reason why we are investing in this type of user is it could increase the top of our funnel, it allows us to build relationships with future users. It's probably the most technical interface a user can have with Twitter compared to a smartphone, which is much easier with an application or desktop web. And so these users are relatively sophisticated and over time, we expect that they will move from a feature phone to a smartphone or a desktop computer and access Twitter that way. But today they are solely accessing Twitter through SMS and we clarify that by calling them fast followers.
In terms of their ability to be monetized, we do have the ability to monetize them. In fact we have just started monetizing them in a very small way through Promoted Accounts and we did that with one partner around IPL. In terms of long-term, we would hope that these SMS fast followers over time would graduate to smartphones and desktop usage. As they do that, their magnitude of usage will increase and our ability to monetize them will increase. But today, the monetization rate of SMS fast followers is going to be meaningfully lower than the monetization rate of any of our other users.

We have time for just two last questions. We will take one from Twitter and then one from the phone line. From Twitter, we will take a question from Jennifer J who asks, can you comment on your M&A strategy? Should we expect to see similar pace of acquisitions in the future quarters?
Dick Costolo
This is Dick. I will start and then Anthony can chime in. Thanks, Jennifer. Listen, I would say that while it's super early days for Periscope, I don't want to get too far out on that. We are really delighted with how acquisitions like that and Vine have worked out for us. So we will continue to be really opportunistic about looking for those kinds of teams and companies in the market, even when they are prelaunch as both Vine and Periscope were when we acquired them.
And I don't know if you want to add anything to that.
Anthony Noto
Sure. The only thing that I would add is that, we really want to make sure that investors are grounded in how we think about M&A from a functionality standpoint or strategic standpoint. And Dick has reiterated those three areas we are focused on and it's those areas that we look for acquisitions, those that will strengthen the core, those that will reduce barriers to consumption in new apps and services and these two acquisitions Periscope and TellApart fit squarely in that third bucket. And you should expect we would continue to look for other opportunities in all three buckets.
Krista Bessinger
Great. And operator, one last question from the phone, please.
Operator
We have Mark May with Citi. Your line is open.
Mark May
Appreciate you taking my questions. I have two, please. It seems like your move to CPX or CPA or whatever your calling it, is somewhat differentiated versus peers and it also seems like it puts a bit more of the onus on Twitter to have a lot of ads to choose from and to be able to target those ads really well. And so the question is, do you think you have the scale with those ads and advertisers and the targeting down so that this transition to CPX will be smooth and incremental in the short to midterm? Or do you think that this may take a little while to play out? And then secondly regarding DoubleClick Bid Manager, can advertisers buying Twitter via DBM, are they able to fully leverage all the data available from your own self-service tool through that channel? And are you guys able to protect like data leakage to Google and others when using platforms like DBM? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Sure. Thank you, Mark. On the move to CPX, we are definitely taking a long-term view and driving towards quality. We think advertisers love our Twitter advertising platform. We started with the hardest to convince advertisers, the branded advertisers Adam and his team built the native product and really pioneered that. So we are very fortunate in that we have formats that our advertisers love and we continue to iterate on making them even better for advertisers.
And the move to CPX is 100% about improving quality for them and it's also about improving quality for the actual user, because it's a much higher bar for someone to win that auction when it's on CPX basis, when you think about predictive click through rates and quality adjusted bids. And so in the quarter, we did see a headwind. It was in the $4 million to $5 million range, if we hadn't switched to CPX from CPM/E formats. CPE didn't offset it, unfortunately we are actually starting to see in the last of couple weeks an improvement in the CPE as it relates to the specific CPX engagement mechanism. So we are encouraged by that. But our guidance reflects that we expect it to take place over time not immediately. I wouldn't want to mislead you that we expect it to happen right now. It's going to take place over the next several quarters and more broadly, we will continue to drive towards quality, even if it comes at the expense of some revenue in the near term, like it did this quarter.
As relates to buying via DBM, what I would say is, I appreciate everyone's questions. A lot of things you are talking about, we obviously would think about when we were striking this deal and we are ensuring that we protect the Twitter franchise and Twitter value by being a great partner. One of the neat things that I can tell you is that DoubleClick is willing to give us Twitter specific attribution mechanisms that are unique to our tweets from a promoted and favorite standpoint, et cetera.
Mark May
Thanks.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thanks everyone for joining us. We appreciate your time and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

Dick Costolo
Hi everyone and thanks for joining us.
I'll be giving you an overview of our financial results and then I would like to spend some time following up on the product initiatives we discussed at our Analyst Day in November regarding all the work we're doing to grow our audience and our business.
Before we jump into the financial results, I want to point out that our pace of execution across the company, which I noted is an area of focus in our Q3 call is already improved and I am delighted about that and about the results I am seeing from the team.
You already see evidence of this improvement in our recent cadence of product launches that are making Twitter better for current users, people who are new to Twitter, developers and marketers.
Okay, financially we had another great quarter with strong revenue growth and very strong profit. Total revenue was $479 million, up 97% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was $141 million, more than doubling since last quarter when it was $68 million and up, 216% year-over-year.
Our adjusted EBITDA reached 30% margins, also up significantly from 18% margins in Q4 of 2013. That quarter closed out a very strong year of financial results for us. In 2014, we had $1.4 billion in revenue, up 111% year-over-year.
Our revenue growth accelerated in 2014 compared to 2013, which was itself a year of significant growth for us. So I want to publicly congratulate everybody involved in building the business engine at Twitter. It's a remarkable collection of people really doing tremendous work.
Okay, moving on to operating metrics. We ended the quarter with 288 million monthly active users. We added four million users this quarter and 47 million across 2014. There are quarter-specific factors that impacted our net ads in Q4, which include seasonality and a couple issues related to the launch of iOS8, we will discuss that in more detail later in this call.
Importantly, I want to highlight that the user numbers we saw in January of this year indicate that our MAU trend has already turned around and our Q1 trend is likely to be back in the range of absolute net ads that we saw during the first three quarters of 2014.
We have a number of projects underway to growth our user base and provide a compelling valuable experience to anyone in the world, whether they have a Twitter account or not. I would like to give you an update on a number of those improvements we made that served the three objectives I discussed with you at Analyst Day and also on our Q3 call.
First three objectives are one; strengthen the core. Two, remove barriers to consumption and three; build new applications and services. When I talk about strengthening the core, what I mean making Twitter more engaging, valuable and easy for logged in users.
On our Q3 earnings call and again at our Analyst Day, we outlined three specific things we would do in this area. One, introduce better media creation and consumption. Two, enhance private messaging between users and groups and three, improve the new user experience and it easier for people to immediately get value out of Twitter, the moment they sign up.
We have launched or have begun testing products in each of these areas. Let me talk first about native mobile video. We're clearly at the very beginning of mobile video sharing and we'll see with video what we've seen with photos on abundance of creation and consumption happening from the device we have with us all the time.
We started our foray into video with Vine, which continues to do quite well and is seeing significant growth in consumption, they're now seeing, they're now seeing more than 1.5 billion Vine loops a day and we've also been bringing video to Twitter through publishers and advertisers over the last several months via both our amplify program and our rollout of video.twitter.com tools to professional publishers.
The data all tell us that people love watching video on Twitter and marketers are seeing great engagement along with tons of earned media.
Just last week, we brought native mobile video to all Twitter users. Now anyone can capture, edit and share videos right within the Twitter app. In expanding video to more people, we want to develop features that make video fast and easy. The simple video editor now in the tweet composer makes it super easy to capture moments as they happen with video on Twitter.
We have a lot more coming on the mobile video front and I am personally investing a good deal of time in this area.
Next, I want to talk about private messaging, which we've long made available through direct messages on Twitter or DMs for short. You've heard me talk before about taking public conversations private and we've launched a number of new features and improvements to make that even easier.
Just last week, we introduced group DMs. Now people can have private conversations with a group of people on Twitter in addition to having those one-on-one conversations. When you couple this release with the ability to share, tweet via DM, which we shipped in Q4, you can see some of the work we're doing to more easily move between public and private conversations on the platform.
Importantly, direct messages give people a way to reach and talk to people they're connected to in some cases only connected to on Twitter. Finally, for the new users who sign up for Twitter every day, we're experimenting with instant timelines as a new way to help people get started more quickly.
We discussed the instant timeline capability at our Analyst Day and I am excited that we've already launched instant timeline experiment in our mobile app. The idea behind this capability is to remove the friction of finding a large set of accounts to follow when you first sign up.
So with instant timeline, a new user gets a rich timeline the moment they sign up and by immediately dropping users into a high quality timeline of great content we believe we will be better able to convert those new signups into healthy long-term users.
The second objective I discussed with you is to remove barriers to consumption from our most active users to someone visiting Twitter for the first time to making it really simple for publishers who want embed Twitter content in their websites or apps, we want people to immediately get value out of Twitter and all we see content that is meaningful and relevant to them.
There are more than 6,000 tweets a minute every day. What one person sees on Twitter is just a very narrow slice of all the amazing content we have on the platform and we have an obligation to better organize content and deliver it in compelling ways to our total audience.
As we've discussed with you before, every month more than a half a billion unique visitors come to Twitter but don't log in. I want to now give you three examples of what I mean by removing barriers to consumption, two of which are already out to users and another that's coming in the next couple weeks.
First, we've been working hard on a compelling product for logged out users and just this week we launched an initial experiment of a logged out home page. We're going to learn a lot from this initial experiment and I expect just iterate quickly based on those lessons learned.
The content people see will be based on algorithms as well as curation. Secondly, it has to be just as easy for logged in users who follow a large number of accounts to quickly catch up. A couple weeks ago, we introduced a new feature called Value or Away. The name is fairly self explanatory. It shows you a few tweets you might be interested in that you might have missed if you haven't been logged into Twitter for a few hours.
We've been testing this for sometime internally and I think it's an elegant way of delivering compelling and engaging tweets to users, the moment they come back to the platform.
Finally in a couple weeks for the Cricket World Cup, we're providing global cricket fans with an immersive experience similar to what we provided for the FIFA World Cup last summer.
The difference will be that this time anyone with a feature phone or smartphone will just as easily be able to see and enjoy these experiences even people without Twitter accounts. You may recall we recently announced our acquisition of ZipDial. We'll be working with them to bring key moments and commentary around the Cricket World Cup to a much larger audience on Twitter.
Our third objective is to build an ecosystem of new applications and services. We closed out 2014 with the introduction of fabric, our new mobile software development platform that makes it easy for developers to build great apps.
I believe fabric can become the infrastructure software layer of the mobile application ecosystem. This is a significant opportunity because fabric helps us build the largest audience in the world and creates new monetization opportunities for us.
Fabric makes it easy for applications to integrate tweets and Twitter timelines with just one line of code and as more and more mobile app integrate Twitter content, the Twitter audience grows.
Furthermore with Fabric, we have the technology in place that makes it easy for Twitter to the monetization engine for mobile apps.
So, as I've highlighted on this call, we’ve launched or have public experiments out for nearly all of the new features we talked about at our Analyst Day in November.
Across our three objectives; strengthen the core, remove barriers to consumption and build an ecosystem of new apps and services will leverage the power of our monetization engine and I've got some exciting business updates to discuss with you today on that front as well.
Because our primary ad unit is a Tweet, the ads can go wherever Tweet go and our monetization engine follows our content on sites across the web or another mobile apps.
We recently announced that we started syndicating ads starting with Flipboard, which launch promoted Tweet in its Twitter section on February 1 and just last week we signed an agreement with Yahoo Japan to monetize our syndicated Twitter timeline on their web properties.
By syndicating ads, the same way we syndicate Tweets, the audience that our marketers can reach obviously extends far beyond our owned and operated mobile apps and websites.
These ads leverage the same rich data and targeting that marketers have access to through Twitter today and ultimately the same measurement. Only now we’re bringing this advertising technology to the rest of the mobile ecosystem.
That we’re beginning to realize the potential for our ad product, by showing relevant timely ads wherever there is Twitter content is a huge accomplishment.
So to wrap up, our product updates introduced improvements to Twitter that make Twitter better for existing users, they make it easier for new users to get started and get immediate value out of Twitter, they provide important tools to developers and make it easy for them to build great apps and they give marketers more channel through which they can take their messages to consumers.
I hope to see the impact of these releases from both a growth and revenue perspective over the coming quarters.
To close out, let me just take a minute to acknowledge that 2014 brought with it a lot of change for the company particularly at the Executive levels. Those changes have brought us to where we are today. We have a great team. Our pace and quality of execution is the best it’s been.
I’m proud of the way the Company has embraced and been fueled by these changes and I couldn’t be more excited about where we’re going and the profound impact Twitter will have along the way.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Anthony to go deeper into the financial.
Anthony Noto 
Thank you, Dick and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll discuss our financial and operating performance for Q4 and provide guidance for Q1 in fiscal year 2015.
In terms of revenue, Q4 was another very strong quarter for Twitter. Total revenue reached $479 million, an increase of 97% year-over-year. Ad revenue reached $432 million also up 97% year-over-year.
Once again ad revenue was driven by strong growth in both the number of advertisers and average revenue per advertiser in each channel and geography.
Our direct sales channel remains the largest contributor accounting for nearly half of the year-over-year growth as we saw particular strength in the U.S., Japan and Canada.
Our expansion efforts in the mid-market and small medium business channels continue to pay off. As growth reaching these channels once again significantly outperformed the overall growth rate of our ad business.
In particular year-over-year growth in SMB revenue accelerated for the second quarter in a row, benefiting from new markets, growth in advertisers and increasing the average revenue per advertiser.
Looking across our products, the vast majority of our year-over-year revenue growth was again driven by promoted photo Tweets up 113% year-over-year.
Website cards, mobile app downloads and promoted video were the primary drivers of promoted Tweet growth. I would point out that two of these three products were introduced in the back half of the year and promoted video currently remains in beta.
In terms of geographies, in Q4 U.S. ad revenue grew 78% or international ad revenue a 141% year-over-year and accounted for 36% of total ad revenue.
International growth was driven by strong growth in both APAC and EMEA. Major movers year-over-year in EMEA included the United Kingdom and Ireland.
In APAC, Japan once again performed well and was the primary driver results in the region. We continue to expand our sales force globally entering 13 new markets in Q4 and in fact we now have a sales presence in 73 countries around the world and see significant room for continued international revenue growth as we continue to sign up new advertisers and further expanding grow each channel around the globe.
Data licensing and other revenue contributed $47 million in the quarter, an increase of 105% year-over-year. We signed an important new partnership with IBM in Q4, which allows enterprises to incorporate Twitter data into their decision making. IBM will be a key channel partner for us in that regard.
Our mobile ad exchange business continues to see very strong growth in the exchange with revenue more than doubling versus the prior year.
Moving on to cost and EBITDA, in Q4 total non-GAAP expenses were $390 million, a 73% increase year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by headcount and related overhead costs as well as infrastructure investment.
We continue to invest in our workforce to scale our business and drive continued product innovation. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $141 million a 216% year-over-year increase.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for Q4 was 30% versus 18% in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA significantly outperformed our expectations through the outperformance in revenue and the challenge of reinvesting revenue upside on such a real-time basis.
Non-GAAP net income was $79 million in the fourth quarter, up from approximately $10 million in the same period a year ago. Our GAAP net loss in the fourth quarter was $125 million, which includes $177 million of stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.12 while GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.20.
Before turning to metrics, I’ll cover a few items related to cash and CapEx. We ended Q4 with roughly $3.6 billion of cash and marketable securities unchanged from Q3. Cash flow from operations was $43 million CapEx totaled $99 million, $30 million of which was financed through capital leases.
Now I’d like to turn to our operating metrics. First on users average monthly active users reached 288 million for the quarter reflecting year-over-year growth of 20% or four million net additions on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
There are a couple of specific factors that negatively impacted net additions in Q4. First we lost approximately four million net users due to the rollout of the iOS8 integration, which primarily impacted our third-party pulling MAUs, but also to a lesser extent impacted Twitter owned and operated MAUs.
Additionally as we mentioned before, Q4 is our seasonally weakest period. Importantly, we’re pleased to see that our current Q1 trends in MAUs will likely result in our Q1 MAUs returning to the level of absolute net ads that we saw during the first three quarters of 2014.
Although we don’t expect the product launches and test announced over the last two weeks to have a meaningful impact on Q1 user growth we’re hopeful that these product initiatives will contribute in subsequent quarters.
Timeline views increased to 182 billion up 23% from the year ago quarter and timeline views per MAU totaled 631 billion up 3% year-over-year and better than our outlook for timeline view per MAU to be flat versus Q4 2013. As we announced in November, we do not intend to disclose timeline views for any future periods.
In terms of monetization ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views continues to show strong growth reaching $2.37 in Q4 up 60% year-over-year and 34% sequentially and better than our outlook of up 28% to 30% sequentially.
In Q4 ad revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in ad engagements importantly CPE also contributed as demand outweigh the supply we made available.
Ad engagements grew 78% year-over-year driven by both an increase in ad load as well as in total ad request. Cost per ad engagement grew 10% year-over-year due to both mix shift to higher price and higher performing ad units as well as an increase in same format CPE.
We’re seeing strong demand for advertising our platform and are encouraged by the continued increases in CPE even with the increase in coverage.
Now I’ll turn to our guidance, before I provide the detail on Q1 guidance I want to quickly provide some color on a relative outperformance with our guidance for Q4.
Last quarter we told you our guidance placed more weight on the opportunities in the quarter coming to fruition versus balancing the opportunities and risks as we had in the past and our advise was to not to deviate meaningfully from our guidance range.
Clearly our reported results exceeded guidance by a significant margin. The significant outperformance was driven by greater than expected acceleration in December, as many brand advertisers ramped spending around the holiday shopping period particularly in the U.S.
In fact when we gave revenue guidance on October 27, the high-end of our revenue guidance range implied 86% year-over-year growth or actual October 2014 revenue had increased 86% year-over-year.
So our guidance at that time was very much in line with the growth rate we’re actually seeing and our expectation for the remainder of the quarter.
That said we’re once again attempting to be more accurate in our revenue guidance relative to results as we continue to place more weight on the opportunities in the quarter coming to fruition.
For that reason and based on current visibility, we do not recommend projections that deviate meaningfully from guidance.
In terms of guidance, for Q1 we expect revenue to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million and EBITDA to be $89 million to $94 million. We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $160 million to $170 million.
Finally, we expect the share count for Q1 to be approximately 645 million shares on a GAAP basis and our fully diluted share count to be approximately 690 million shares on a non-GAAP basis.
For the full year 2015, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.3 billion $2.35 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be $550 million $575 million. We expect stock-based compensation expense of $700 million to $750 million and we expect CapEx to be between $500 million and $650 million.
Finally I would like to note a few things on guidance before taking your questions. First, these guidance ranges are based on currency rates as of January 31, 2015. In fact currency has naively impacted our first quarter and full year 2015 outlook, specifically our Q1 2015 revenue guidance is $6.5 million lower just due to the currency change from Q4 2014 to January 31, 2015.
Second as you think about modeling quarterly estimates in 2015, please consider the following factors. First revenue in Q1 2014 benefited from the Olympics, which is obviously not going to occur again in 2015.
Without the Olympics, our sequential revenue growth in Q1 2014 would have been minus 1%. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2014, we benefited from the World Cup. Without the revenue from the World Cup, our second quarter 2014 sequential revenue growth would have been 15%.
We are sharing these additional considerations with you to provide a proper context as you think about each quarter of 2015. However, even with these considerations, our guidance still calls for a continued robust growth and we look forward to executing with excellence in order to have another year of significant outperformance in 2015.
With that we’re ready to take your questions. Operator, would you please announce the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Mahaney
Thanks. Two questions please on the slew of third-party deals Yahoo Japan, Flipboard, Google congrats on getting those. How could we -- how should we look for the impact of those in the P&L any broad details you can provide would be great.
And then on the engagement metrics going forward Anthony, what should we be able to look at in order to track what’s happening to engagement whether it’s improving or declining if you no longer disclosing timeline views. Thank you. 
Dick Costolo
Thanks Mark. This is Dick, let me jump in there with a brief overview of the way we’re thinking about these third-party relationships and I’ll let Anthony chime in on the details and address the engagement question as well.
First of all, on the third party relationships, really think about those in two ways. There are deals where we’re distributing our content to third-parties that we’re now starting to monetize and that’s new and exciting for us and that’s the Yahoo relationship and the Flipboard relationship.
And then the second kind of deal that we’re looking at now and talking about are the Google type deal. So I do want to confirm that we have a relationship that we’ve agreed to with Google I don’t have any more detail to share about it at this time.
But those -- what’s new about those deals is that they will drive traffic and distribute traffic to our logged out experience and that’s the way we’re thinking about those relationship now differently than we were thinking about them previously and Anthony, why don't you jump in and take the rest.
Anthony Noto
Sure. Mark, in terms of the impact of these third party deals, they were all considered in the guidance that we provide you today, so we’re in that consideration.
In terms of engagement metrics, as I mentioned we no longer going to provide the metric of timeline view and the reason for that is, it’s really a measurement that doesn’t reflect the initiatives that we’re doing.
In fact if anything, we’re taking specific initiatives and product changes that will hurt timeline view. As an example, the recently launched product, While you were away, will cause you not to have to go through many timeline views to find something that was really important to you eight hours ago.
And so -- and that’s why we decided to eliminate the timeline view metric given that we have specific product changes that will hurt that metric.
More broadly as we think about engagement, there are number of different way that we measure engagement. There is no one perfect way. When it comes to advertising it's going to be click-through rate and it’s actually different by each format.
A mobile app download click-through rate is very different than a regular promoted tweet that could be either re-tweeted or favorite as a measurement of payment. Additionally on the consumer side many companies use DAU to MAU and while that is a long-term goal of us -- of ours to become a daily product, today we have great variance in DAU to MAU across geographies.
In our more mature markets we have very high DAU to MAU 50 plus. In the emerging markets, we have very low DAU to MAU at 20% range, they all migrate up to a higher rate over time and so as we get to point where we have a metric that’s going to really reflect what we're trying to do we'll share that with you. At this point there is a number of them that we look at and no one metric to share.
Mark Mahaney
Thanks Anthony. Thanks Dick.
Krista Bessinger
Great, thank you. Next question please operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Paul Vogel
Great, thank you. Just two questions one, first on the MAU number as we think about the first quarter if you add back the $4 million you lost, the run rate getting back to where you were in the first three quarter is in acceleration.
So is that just seasonality? You mentioned that's sort of new products really having clicked them yet. So I’m just really curious as the acceleration there, but seasonality or something else.
And then on the advertising side, if you could just talk about the pitch you're making to advertisers on terms of monetizing the non-logged in users, how that’s being received and how you’re selling that advertising relative to what you sell on sort of a core logged in user. Thanks.
Dick Costolo
Sure. Thank Paul this is Dick. In Q1 I would say it’s a combination of seasonality or return to organic growth and the set of product initiatives we’ve created to drive growth, I mean again at a high level, I’d like to say that I’m thinking about growth and our product were as your changes were making now as helping us grow across logged in, logged out and our syndicated audience across the web and third party mobile apps.
And the user numbers we saw in January again indicate that our MAU trend is already turned around and that Q1 trend is likely to be back in the range of absolute net ads that we saw during the first three quarters of 2014, so on a great place there again I would stress that is seasonality or return to organic growth and product initiatives all taken together.
Anthony Noto
Paul one thing I want to clarify as you mentioned the word acceleration so for everyone’s benefit we added 14 million monthly active viewers on a net basis sequentially in Q1 of 2014. 
In Q2 of 2014, we added 60 million net monthly active users and then in the third quarter we added 13, when we say that Q1 trends are likely to indicate that we back towards the trend of absolute net ads in Q1, Q3 of 2014 we’re referring to those specific numbers ’14,’16 and ’13 not anything else from a percentage basis. 
Dick Costolo
Paul, just Dick again to address your second question specifically it's going to be the very ad unit that we brought to our Twitter own in properties and now are syndicating into this third party experiences that we will be brining to the logged out experience on Twitter. 
It’s important for me to highlight that we are first going to be very, very focused on delivering a delightful user experience I talked in my prepared remarks little bit about the fact that it will be a combination of algorithmic, algorithm generated timelines and duration. 
We want to really nail that down but once that’s nail down we’re already step to go on delivering that promoted Twit ad unit into the logged out experience.
Krista Bessinger
Great, next question please operator?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Ross Sandler
Thanks. Just two quick questions, Dick we know its early but the recent product releases can you just talk about which are showing the most traction and how they are impacting engagement?
And then Anthony on the full year guidance about 70% high end including FX and lack of Olympics and World Cup, so that suggest not a lot of deceleration, can you just talk about where you expect ad load to be in 2015 and what that the growth look likes for me same advertiser basis versus new advertisers? Thanks.
Dick Costolo
Hi, Ross its Dick. In answer to your first question, it's just -- it's simply too early to have any data to share as to the impact of those features we’ve released in January, I would say that when I think about them in the context of how their growth drivers.
The features we’ve released in January is like made a video and group them, make Twitter richer and more enjoyable experience both for a new users and as an increasingly daily use case for existing users.
I'm also finally particularly excited about instant timeline, when we talked about at Analyst Day, one of the reasons all of us here are so enthusiastic about it is because we know that the follow action is the high friction action for new users and removing that action completely and dropping users into a really high quality timeline right away we’re hopeful, we’ll drive immediate engagement and create long term users out of that large group of people have coming into the top of the funnel.
Anthony Noto
And then Ross, as it relates to your advertising question at the Analyst Day, I talked about an opportunity over the long term to get the 5% at load and we didn’t see that was a limit that was opportunity overtime and how we would get there. 
We’re so far from that 5% today and that’s not how we actually model the business, the way we model the business is really on a demand basis which you alluded to, which is the amount of spending of existing advertisers plus advertising spending from new advertisers. 
And I can tell you the bottom of forecast and top down forecast that we put together for 2015 that we share with you on revenue, we still won’t be near that 5% to get there, obviously the amount of inventory in that 5% will grow with our user base but we’re far from getting to that 5% opportunity long term and our forecast reflects, the demand side equation related to supply, given such access supply compared to demand.
Ross Sandler
Great, thanks guys.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. And the next question we’re going take from Twitter, it comes from the Twitter account of Dan Ernst at Hudson Square. And he asks why wouldn’t a logged off visitor to Twitter be agreed by a curated best of breed and set of trending tweets and also a brand out?
Dick Costolo
Hi Daniel, it’s Dick. That’s exactly correct, that’s exactly what we will be doing. I would say once again that it’s important to me that we really deliver a delightful user experience, first and foremost. 
One of the reasons we launched that logged out experience on web first and so that so we update quickly as we learn, how users are engaging with and what’s already we will be delivery promoted tweets from all sorts of our advertisers into that experience.
Krista Bessinger
Great, thank you. Operator next question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Douglas Anmuth
Thanks for taking the questions. Two things I wanted to ask, first can you use the algorithms from instant timelines and then also while you were away to like people develop more customized timelines within their own experience kind of take that beyond just logged out or just the initial experience through instant timelines.
And then secondly as you enhance the experience of logged out users, particularly with the launch of the home pages, is there a concern that you could go too far in delivering a good user experience for logged out that would not let people or drive the incentive for them to log in as much. Thanks.
Dick Costolo
Hey Doug this is Dick Costolo. I think that, that algorithm that really powers both that recommendation engine for while you were away and Instant Timeline and others is an algorithm that we've been working on for some time.
It’s gotten solid enough that we really like the instant timeline it delivers, but I think it will be a while as we continue to learn and roll out instant timeline before we use it in some new and additional way that we -- that’s beyond what we're using it for now.
So do think it will be on a period of learning around instant timeline and iterating on that and improving it because we have such a great opportunity there with new users they come to the platform.
And as it regards, does the, is the logged out experience going to cannibalize logged in experience in anyway, actually view it kind of a flip the around. And it’s the case today that we have got this, really incredible opportunity and around the people that hear about Twitter or aware of Twitter and are driven to the platform because they see it on TV or they hear about it on press somewhere.
And we've drawn this well in front of them today and force them to go through all of these hoops in order to get started. So I'm actually of the mind that, that logged out experience will be a way to show them what Twitter is and how valuable it is and all the amazing content that’s on the platform and then as they want to engage with it they can become logged in users.
Douglas Anmuth
Okay, thanks guys.
Krista Bessinger
Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Heath Terry
Great, thanks. Dick, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of the engineering priorities for this year, how important were product introductions like while your way be versus improving the algorithms around personalization for existing products like the discovered timeline.
Dick Costolo
Yeah, sure thanks Heath. That’s -- it can be very straightforward answer about it. The algorithms -- the backend if you will around the capabilities that are driving these algorithmic while your way, instant time etcetera, it is the number one priority.
It drives so much of the high quality engagement on the platform that, that’s probably first and foremost where we'll devote a lot of resources.
Having said that, lots of kinds of product experiences will emerge from network, the Magic Racks product experience emerged from network. As I mentioned once we get through instant timeline, there are lots of other things we want to do with that capability.
As another example we’ve got an experience out to users who come back to the platform who registered while ago haven’t been with us and come back, they previously would come back into whatever, however many or few accounts they followed before.
Now we can drop them into sort of resurrection instant timeline if you will, I will focus on that more as we like the results of instant timeline. So that backend is going to power a lot of experiences and we’re spending a lot of time and energy there.
Heath Terry
Great, thanks. Dick.
Krista Bessinger
Great, and we will take our next question from Twitter from the account of [Matt Sullen]. And he asks do you see impact to revenue in 2015 as a result of strength in the U.S. dollar versus other currencies?
Anthony Noto
Thank you, Matt, its Anthony. Our 2015 revenue guidance of $2.3 billion to $2.35 billion is in fact impacted by currency. On a constant currency basis to January 31, 2015, it would have been $55 million to $56 million higher than what we actually gave as guidance.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. Next question please operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Eric Sheridan
Thanks for taking the questions. Anthony two for you may be on the guidance going forward. Over the last couple of quarters you really demonstrated a tremendous amount of leverage in the business in terms of the margins and the beats on the EBITDA line.
Any update you can give us some sort of what other than just incremental revenue is driving that leverage and whether its informed any new way you're thinking about the long-term profitability of the company.
Second on CapEx, that was maybe a bigger increase than we thought year-on-year in the way you're forecasting ’15? Anyway you can carve out sort of the priorities for those dollars in the capital budget 2015. Thanks so much.
Anthony Noto
In terms of leverage at Analyst Day, we took the time to give a new perspective on our long term margins. During the IPO, the company had articulated our long term margin profile of 35% to 40%. 
And on Analyst Day given the leverage of performance that we achieved as a public company during the first year and having more information about the business more broadly, we’d raised our long term adjusted EBITDA margin to 40% to 45%.
The leverage that we are getting today is primarily due to the our performance in revenue and not being able to reinvest fast enough and while we have contingencies in the quarter on the positive side, the investment certain areas of things do I perform it’s just a really hard thing to do in a real time basis.
There are productivity initiatives, as you would imagine in addition to just operating leverage but that contributes a very small component to the overall operating leverage that you are seeing today at this point but this is a long term opportunity for us and that’s why we give the long term margin of 40% to 45%.
As relates to your CapEx question, there's two big investments in CapEx. In 2015 one is a third data center. We have two data centers now and a third data center importantly will allow us to have greater redundancy. Today we have to completely replicate what's in one data center and the other data center. Having a third data center will allow us to get some productivity leverage as well.
The second thing that's impacting CapEx in 2015 is real estate capital expenditures. We're building out additional space in San Francisco and in New York and those are two big expenditures as it relates to building out CapEx, but we're also in the process of continuing to upgrade our locations from a capacity standpoint internationally and so we're seeing CapEx go up quite meaningfully over 100% from real estate.
Eric Sheridan
Great. Thanks for the color Anthony.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. Next question please operator.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Justin Post
Thank you. Just looking and I know you don't want to disclose the churn. Can you just give us your high level thoughts on user churn maybe some kind of numbers around what percent of people have churned off of Twitter? Any thoughts you can provide there?
And then what initiatives you're doing to get those people back that might be working so far and are you optimistic you can bring a lot of these people back this year? Thank you.
Anthony Noto
So as it relates to churn broadly we don't release the specific number, but I will tell you churn has improved in November and December compared to the prior months and we're encouraged by that.
Our growth team has a number of initiatives that are specifically addressed at converting unhealthy users to healthy users very early in their life time on Twitter and more where Dick talked to in timeline.
The whole goal of the timeline is to make end user healthy user day one, second one for that matter and so there is a lot of initiatives against the whole concept of having healthy users from day one and if they're not, addressing that very quickly after they've come on to the platform before we missed the opportunity to improve there.
So I am encouraged by the churn and ensuring there is a lot of initiatives there.
Justin Post
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Great. And we will take our next question from Twitter. It comes from the account of [Kevin McGoldrick]. He asks how do you see Vine's relationship with the new native video option and how do you see that interaction playing out?
Dick Costolo
Yes, thanks Kevin, this is Dick. Maybe let me pan back and talk about video across the Twitter ecosystem between Vine, consumer video and Twitter professional video on Twitter etcetera.
Our mission is to give people the power to capture and share ideas and information instantly without barriers and that work instantly capturing life or a moment or an event as it happens and communicating it as it happens is how we think about Twitter video being vital to consumers.
And it's one of the reasons we created that simple capture and share capability in the Tweet composer. You can think about all those benchmark moments on Twitter New Year's Eve, Ferguson etcetera, imaging being able to capture those on video and sharing them instantly with the world, that's where we think we're really going to stand out.
I think Vine as really a creative medium in its own right, an artistic medium in its own right. You see the emergence of all these Vine stars and what they've been able to do on the platform as distinct from, but complementary to native mobile video across the Twitter ecosystem.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. Operator, next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Anthony DiClemente
Thank you very much. Just one for Dick and one for Anthony. Dick just a follow-up on your commentary just now about video, can you just elaborate on where professional video fits into that? Maybe give us an update on Amplify and your professional video efforts.
And then Anthony just on monetization, you mentioned that CPE grew 10%, that's a strong number, you did mention that part of that was attributed to mix shift and a part of it was growth in same format CPE. I am just trying to get a little bit more dig into those two in terms of what was a bigger driver?
And then moving forward what are the higher price ad products? Is there is a mix shift to a higher priced ad product be it video or another as we head into future quarters that will potentially continue to drive CPE growth as driven by mix shift, thanks?
Dick Costolo
Sure, this is Dick. On to your first question regarding professional video, I think of that as being a continuum from -- at one end of the -- our content partner like the NFL and the NBA and the broadcast networks at maybe one end of the spectrum to you and me and our friends at the other end of the spectrum.
And then all these sorts of folks like the Vine stars if you will in the middle there who are increasingly becoming professional and migrating from consumer uses of video to professional, we want to provide tools across that spectrum.
So what you’re seeing from us now is one, broadening the role out of our amplified program globally to more than 130 partners now and layering on to that capabilities like SnappyTV and video.twitter.com for other kinds of content creators who may not be a broadcast network or the NFL or the NBA, but seek to monetize their content and distribute longer than 30 second video on our platform.
What I mentioned briefly earlier in my prepared remarks that we will also be providing more and more capabilities there, that’s what I was referring to, that sort of middle tier of content creators who were looking to do more will see more and more capabilities and tools from us on the platform.
Anthony Noto
And then Anthony as it relates to your question on CPE versus engagements, engagements was the broader driver of our overall growth up 78% year-over-year. From a CPE perspective, it’s somewhat of a complicated answer.
From a pure mix perspective, our faster growing newer units are higher priced units but click through rate unit. As an example a mobile app download or a video they have different mechanisms that are the pay for phones mechanisms that drives the click through rate.
And we’re charging differently for them based on a click through rate that’s lower in the overall funnel from a marketing perspective and so CPE should improve as that mix shift continues in that direction and click through rate could in fact decrease as we do that, which is what we saw this quarter.
But there’s one underlying economic trend that also matters and that’s the balance between supply and demand, which is driven by our load factor. And so there could be circumstances, where our supply is significantly greater than our demand and you wouldn’t see that increase in CPE, because of the excess supply relative to demand.
In this quarter that was not the case. In this quarter, we did increase load factor, but demand was still greater than supply and that’s why we saw CPE increase both due to mix and same format CPE.
Anthony DiClemente
Got it. Really helpful. Thank you.
Anthony Noto
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Operator, next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Ben Swinburne
Thank you. Anthony, in the guidance do you assume much contribution from the new syndicated advertising partnerships you have and will add and if you do, could you just help us think about gross versus net if there is any kind of rev share associated with that?
And then Dick, can you just give us some color on why Twitter ended its Google integration years ago and why it made sense then, it doesn’t make sense now and now it makes sense to get together. Some color there would be great.
Anthony Noto
Sure, on the first part of your question, Ben, what I would say is these deals were considered in our guidance. I didn't provide a perspective on whether there is revenue or not -- revenue or how much as if they were considered.
In terms of how revenue will be recognized as it relates to these syndicated monetization deals, it really comes down to what channel it goes through. We have two channels. One is in exchange and that revenue is recognized on a net basis. If it goes through a ad network, that revenue is recognized on a gross basis and it depends on whether demand is coming from and who the winner of a specific ad is.
Dick Costolo
Hey Ben, it's Dick, let me try to answer the Google question this way if I may. We've obviously had a relationship with Google over the course of the years with all the bunch of the executives here and a bunch of the executives there obviously know each other quite well.
I would say that the way we think about the Google deal now without again -- without going into any of the details distinct from the kind of relationship we had in the past is that we've got the opportunity now to drive a lot of attention to an aggregate eye balls if you will to these logged out experiences, topics and events that we plan on delivering on the front page of Twitter. And that's one of the reasons this makes a lot more sense for us now.
Ben Swinburne
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. Operator, next question.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Ron Josey
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just I wanted to come back a little bit on product improvements. I know we talked a lot about it, but specifically on the on-boarding process I am wondering if the revised process has helped to really convert the logged out users to logged in users.
And if that is the case, that's just given you all confidence in seeing in new trends return to where they were a year ago. Thank you.
Dick Costolo
So I would say that none of the work we've done to date around a logged out users or experiences for users who aren’t logged into Twitter has had any impact at all yet on the kind of outlook we provided to you for Q1.
And then again over time, we think about our ability to get people excited about Twitter content and experience Twitter content by coming to the front page of the site or other ways they might get to a logged out Twitter experience as sort of an on ramp or an on-boarding vehicle into eventually becoming a more engaged logged in user.
Ron Josey
Great, thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Twitter from the account Wayne Fowler. The question is do you have forecast as they have beneficial the new Google deal will be with regard to user growth. 
Anthony Noto 
So we’ll excited about the new Google’s deal, everyone is asked questions about, thank you. Dick mentioned very clearly that we’re doing this because we have a great opportunity to leverage the tremendous audience they have and their interest in relevant real time information and bringing that to their logged out home page.
The logged out home page doesn’t necessarily mean those users will translate into monthly active users. If we do our job and given the right type of content and causing them to be engaged and given the right experience over time that will happen but today that’s not what we are focused on nor what we expect over the course of time there is an opportunity though.
Dick Costolo 
Let may be may be just chime in one more piece of information this is not something that you’re going to see launch or rolled out for several months. I would just make that very clear.
Krista Bessinger
Great, thank you. Operator next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Mark May
Thank you. I had two and Anthony I’m actually going to ask another on Google. I believe that you are generating data licensing revenue from that deal and so given Google scale or I would seem that could be material incremental new source of revenue. Can you give us a sense of how that’s impacting Q1 and full year revenue?
And then if you can provide a little more color on what exactly happen with the iOS8 update that you referenced and as your expectation that you will be able to recover most if that all of this 4 million users that you talked about in the New Year.
Anthony Noto
Sure. As it relates to Google and any revenue considerations, we’re not providing any perspective on that at this time. The one perspective relative to your question, I would provide I'll just echo Dick's point that this is a relationship that we will roll out in several months from now which means not in Q1 since we're already in February.
In terms of your second question, let me just give you some specific numbers as it relations iOS. So we said we lost four million monthly active users due to the iOS8 integration. One million of those monthly active users were Twitter owned and operated monthly active users and three million were on Safari, what we call Auto point MAU’s and we lost those.
We don’t expect to get the three million Autopoint MAU’s in Safari back and that’s a non-Twitter owned and operated Autopoint MAU. The one million that number was actually higher at a different point in the quarter when we were able to bring it back down to just one.
Dick Costolo
Hey Mark, this is Dick. Let me, may be I’d leave in a little bit more color there that might be helpful. We obviously have a great relationship with Apple. I've talked about that at length over the course of the last two years.
On the second part of what Anthony talked about there, there was unforeseen bug in the release of iOS8 as it relates to the specific Twitter integration into iOS that’s why it was particular to us.
Once we understood the issue, we move just quickly as we could on multiple fronts to minimize its impact, but it wasn’t -- it wasn’t a one size fits off fix, which is why you've seen some of the complexity that we talked about here in brining those users back. The problem was a complex and affected different users differently.
Mark May
Thanks.
Krista Bessinger

Our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, this is [Steve] filling in Peter. Thanks for the question. Some very nice developments on the content side here this quarter, hoping you can provide an update on commerce efforts and retail initiatives in the fourth quarter.
We know that brands, left with other stories to the Twitter users, but we also think the ability to prove our ROI through e-comm and direct transactions and increased efforts in the area of attribution could play a larger role, did you comment on successes with direct response advertising, your driven communication or click through buy from Tweet.
Dick Costolo
Sure, Peter this is Dick. I’ll comment on commerce generally and then Anthony, if you have anything you want to add, chime in. We continue to experiment with buy now and offers and commerce on Twitter.
You may have seen some of the -- some of the things we're running during the Super Bowl of some of the people and events and groups participating in the Super Bowl and we don't have anything new to add on top of that or don't have anything additional to announce right now other than those continued experiments that we're running.
Anthony Noto
And as it relates to a direct response, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that the SMB channel saw a second consecutive quarter of faster year-over-year growth rate and acceleration. So we're encouraged by that, but it's still very early days.
We had shared with you the number of advertisers that we had in that channel at Analyst Day. The number is growing very nicely. It's very encouraging, but it's still sub of 100,000 and so there is still big opportunity for us as it relates to DR.
Unidentified Analyst
Great. Thanks for the color.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. Operator, I think we have time for just one last question please.

Our next question will come from the line of Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.
Youssef Squali
All right. Thank you. Two quick questions. First what was the impact of the self service ad products over this quarter or you guys open the whole bunch in the last quarter and maybe can you comment on the mix between the direct sales and self service ads over season?
And second, the impact of -- I know this is early, but just the impact of promoted video in the quarter and kind of pricing you're seeing there?
Anthony Noto
As it relates to self serve, that exist in both the MMS channel and the SMB channel. We haven't broken out those specific revenue segments and we're not prepared to do now, but as I mentioned, they both performed very well and grew faster than the overall growth rates.
As it relates to self serve international versus domestic, domestic self service, they're bigger on absolute dollar basis than international, but we haven't broken out those segments either.
Youssef Squali
Thank you.

And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Dick Costolo.
Dick Costolo
Hi everyone and thanks for joining us.
I want to spend some time giving you a view of our strategy to build the largest audience in the world, a strategy we've started to lay out for you on the last two calls, but first an overview of the quarter.
We had another very strong quarter financially; revenue growth of 114% year-over-year, totaling $361 million. Adjusted EBITDA rose to $68 million, up from $9 million just a year ago.
We continue to make progress in user growth adding 13 million net new users in the quarter, including another three million net new users in the U.S. for the second straight quarter. That brings us to 43 million new monthly active users for the year and 284 million monthly active users in total.
We've talked in the last several months about the size of our total audience and the additional reach of our ad exchange, so I want to put all the pieces together for you today and what you'll hear will echo some of my comments from last week at Flight, our mobile developer conference.
You should think about the size of our total audience as a series of geometrically eccentric circle. At the core, you have our monthly active users. They are our most engaged users contributing and consuming the vast amount of great content on Twitter. Those contributions are the fuel that powers the entire system.
In the circle beyond that, we have the logged out audience on our owned and operated properties. Hundreds of millions of users that come to Twitter every month, but don't log in. We've talked about the size of this group of users as another one to 2X the size of the core and that remains the case.
In the third circle beyond this are the people we reach in syndication via embedded tweets and timelines across the web and now across the mobile app ecosystem through our new mobile developer platform Fabric, which I'll talk more about in a minute.
We think about everything we do in the context of this set of geometrically eccentric circles and think it's useful for you too as well. Then I would say we have three objectives that we're focused on across this total audience. One, strengthen the core. We have to continue to grow our monthly active users and make Twitter an increasingly daily used case for them.
Three of the priorities to strengthen the core include improving the new user experience and getting new users a high quality timeline the moment they sign up for the service.
Second, providing much better rich media creation and consumption tools and experiences to drive more breadth and depth of content and lastly, adding functionality to our direct messaging service to enable users to move fluidly between the public conversation and private conversation all on Twitter.
This quarter saw several launches along those lines as one example we rolled out a brand new web on-boarding flow that dramatically simplifies the sign-up process and that automatically creates a timeline based on what topics users choose as well as our browsing history.
We get them into a fully populated timeline that does not require them to immediately know the language of Twitter or who is on Twitter etcetera. Expect to see this on mobile in short order.
Not only is the breadth and depth of content expanding, but that content is some of the best across the digital landscape just looking at television and music we hosted the season premiere teaser of Showtime's hit show Homeland and one of ABC's new show Selfie and exclusive videos and music form such diverse musicians as U2, One Direction and even a Michael Jackson video, all exclusive to Twitter.
Our second objective is to reduce barriers to consumption to help build the largest total audience in the world. We will continue to innovate on ways to better organize our content to deliver the right experiences at the right time for all types of users logged in, logged out and on syndicated partner properties.
And the third objective is building new applications and services. Our announcement of Fabric, a week ago at our develop conference is the most recent initiative in this area and components of Fabric are already in use by tens of thousands of developers around the world collectively reaching well over one billion IOS and Android users.
We believe Fabric can be the one SDK that any global app developer needs to embed in their application. We provide crash reporting, beta testing and analytics from the moment a developer is getting started, when developers are ready to launch their production apps, we provide identity services in the form of Twitter log in and Digits, our next generation native mobile sign-up service.
Digits provides developers with multiple competitive advantages over other sorts of identity services including building their own native mobile sign-up and finally developers can easily turn on the MoPub kit, our mobile ad exchange when they're ready to monetize their apps at scale harnessing our best-in-class ad mediation and exchange technologies.
In closing, I am happy with the strategy and the quality of the work we're doing, but given our significant aspirations and the breadth of the opportunity in front of us, it's more critical than ever that we increase our overall pace of execution.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Anthony to go deeper into the financials.
Anthony Noto
Thank you, Dick and good afternoon everyone.
I'll discuss our financial and operating performance for Q3 and provide our guidance for Q4. Q3 was another strong quarter for Twitter. Total revenue reached $361 million, up 114% from the year ago period, and $21 million above the high end of our guidance range.
Ad revenue reached $320 million, up 109% year-over-year. Growth was strong across all channels with the DSO channel being the largest contributor, while the MMS and small-medium business channel growth rates outperformed.
Looking by product, the vast majority of our year-over-year revenue growth was driven by promoted tweets, up 136% year-over-year as we saw a meaningful contribution from new ad formats including mobile app downloads website cards and promoted video ads.
In Q3, USR revenue grew 88% while international ad revenue grew 164% year-over-year and accounted for 35% of total ad revenue. International growth outperformed the U.S., driven by strong growth in both APAC and EMEA countries.
In Q3 we expanded our sales efforts to 12 new markets in Europe. We also expanded the reach of Twitter self-serve ad platform to 12 new countries. We now cover over 45% of our consumer footprint with the ability for advertisers to use our self-serve platform.
We now have a sales presence in 60 countries around the world and see significant room for continued international revenue growth as we further expand and grow each channel around the globe.
Looking by platform, our mix of revenue from mobile also continues to grow with 85% of total ad revenue now generated from mobile devices up from approximately 70% from the prior year period.
Data licensing and other revenue contributed $41 million in the quarter, an increase of 171% year-over-year. This growth was driven by both mobile ad exchange business and a full quarter of the Gnip data licensing business.
Moving on to cost and EBITDA. In Q3, total expenses were $341 million, up 85% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by headcount and related overhead cost as well as infrastructure investment. We continue to invest in our workforce to scale our business and drive continued product innovation and begin to drive broader trial of the product.
We ended the quarter with approximately 3,600 employees. Adjusted EBITDA margin for Q3 was 19%, more than three times that of Q3 2013 and up 200 basis points sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $68 million, compared to just $9 million in the prior year period and above the high end of our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA significantly outperformed our expectations through the outperformance in revenue and lower than expected hiring in the period.
Non-GAAP net income was $7 million in the third quarter up from a non-GAAP net loss of approximately $17 million in the same period a year ago. This includes approximately $600,000 in interest expenses from the convertible notes for the partial period as well as an unrealized FX loss of $8 million from the mark-to-market balance sheet accounts.
Excluding the cash interest expense and the convertible notes, in the unrealized loss from FX adjustments, non-GAAP net income would have been $15 million.
For modeling purposes, we expect the quarterly interest expense to be roughly $20 million to $25 million on a GAAP basis and $4 million on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP net loss in the third quarter was $175 million, which includes $170 million of stock based compensation expense.
Before returning to metrics, I want to cover a few items related to cash and CapEx. We successfully completed a convertible note offering, raising approximately $1.7 billion, net of the convertible hedge at very attractive rates.
We ended Q3 with roughly $3.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. Cash used in operations was $88 million, CapEx was $101 million, $62 million of which was financed through capital leases.
Now I would like turn to our operating metrics, first on users. Average monthly active users reached 284 million for the quarter, reflecting 13 million net additions in the period.
We added three million users in the U.S. and 10 million internationally. Net ads in the U.S. were in line with Q2, while international net ads slowed a bit sequentially due primarily to the implementation of increased authentication measures, which negatively affected users in a number of APAC countries.
In addition Q3 did not have the benefit seen in Q2 from elections in India and news events in South Korea. Timeline views increased to approximately 181 billion up 14% from a year ago time period. Timeline views per MAU were down 7% versus the prior year to 636 as expected.
The year-over-year decline primarily reflects the changes we've been making to allow users to more efficiently access to our content. We will continue to focus on driving the better product experience, which may pressure timeline views per MAU over time.
That said, based on our current trends, we expect timeline views per MAU in Q4 could be flat on a year-over-year basis.
Switching to monetization, ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views continue to show strong growth reaching $1.77 in Q3, up 83% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. U.S. ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views reached $4.28, up 66% year-over-year and international ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views reached $0.84 up 132% year-over-year.
We continue to see steady improvement in monetization as we expand geographically, roll out new ad products and improve targeting, attribution and ROI. Given this and the expected seasonal fourth quarter strength in advertising demand, we expect to see sequential growth of approximately 28% to 30% in ad revenue per timeline view in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to cost per ad engagement, in Q3 ad revenue grew 109% on a year-over-year basis despite a decline of 17% in cost per ad engagements. The increase was driven by total ad engagements, which grew more than 150% year-over-year, reflecting higher quality ads, improved prediction and targeting and media forward.
Cost per ad engagement grew 3% quarter-over-quarter due to the increased adoption of higher price and higher performing ad units. Now I would like to turn to our guidance.
Before I provide the detail on our guidance, I wanted to note that in the past, we've outperformed our guidance approach balance the opportunities and risk in setting expectations. This quarter however we're attempting to be more accurate in our revenue guidance relative to results.
As we've placed more weight on the opportunities in the quarter come to fruition. For that reason and based on current visibility, we do not recommend projections that deviate meaningfully from our guidance.
For the fourth quarter of 2014, we're raising the range for total fourth quarter 2014 revenue to $440 million to $450 million, which is $23 million higher than the previously implied fourth quarter range established after our Q2 results. We're raising our adjusted fourth quarter 2014 expected EBITDA range to $100 million to $105 million, which is $60 million above our previous range at the midpoint.
We expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $175 million to $185 million and we expect CapEx to be between $120 million and $150 million. We're raising our range for total revenue for 2014 to $1,365 million to $1,375 million, which is $50 million above our previous range at the midpoint.
The increase in revenue guidance for the full year 2014 reflects our Q3 outperformance and our increased expectations for the fourth quarter. Moving on to adjusted EBITDA. We're raising our range for adjusted EBITDA to $260 million to $265 million, which is $43 million above our previous range at the midpoint. The increase in adjusted EBITDA guidance also reflects our Q3 outperformance and our increased expectation for the fourth quarter.
Before we take your questions, I want to take this opportunity to remind all of you of our upcoming Analyst Day on November 12. We look forward to seeing you there.
With that, we're ready to take questions. Operator, will you please announce the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Thanks for taking the question. Two things, first, can you guys just talk about the experiments that you're doing so far around content organization and when you think about your ability to potentially move away from somewhat reverse [cron] (ph) or give additional choices beyond that, how do you know when is the right time to implement that?
And then Anthony can you also just comment on the impact and explain a little bit more around the authentication efforts that you mentioned around the international user number? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Sure, Doug on your first question, I think the keyword that you mentioned is experiments. Obviously, Twitter will always be a real time network. That is our number one priority when we think about the user experience.
But there are time periods when something incredibly relevant to you as a user could have occurred hours ago before you open up the Twitter app and we will see unique opportunities like that to give you content that's incredibly relevant even if it's not based on what happened most recently, but I want to emphasize more than anything else is Twitter will always be a real time network.
We have been experimenting with a number of different initiatives. One example would be for user repeatedly post a refresh on the mobile app and there is no content delivered to them instead of giving them an [all set] (ph), we're now providing something that we think would be relevant to them and that's just one of the examples where we're trying in that area.
In terms of the authentication efforts and impact on MAU, over the last two quarters, we've taken a more deep view of what can we attribute to our actions within a quarter through our over net MAU growth.
And the specific comment I made about the authentication issues in Asia and that region, we saw a negative impact from a higher level authentication standard that we applied, that cause us to lose one to two million monthly active users because of that specific initiative.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Okay. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Paul Vogel - Barclays
Great. Thanks so much. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about your retail initiative on the advertising side as well. So the experimentation on the buy button and the recent acquisition of CardSpring and how those all are going to play out together?
Dick Costolo
Thanks Paul, this is Dick. The CardSpring acquisition is definitely related to tying that team together around our ongoing commerce efforts. I wouldn’t extrapolate too much from what you’ve seen around the Buy Now button that we've launched on Twitter to any sort of forward-looking expectation.
We're continuing to explore the way we think about in the moment commerce and now commerce and the different kinds of opportunities we see in that area and also to continue to play around with explorations there and look at opportunities in that area, as opposed to thinking about what you're seeing today as what we're launching permanently.
Paul Vogel - Barclays
Okay. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Thanks guys, just two quick questions. First on the off Twitter users and then a comment on the guidance Anthony. So can you guys just help us understand the behavior of logged off users specifically how often do they come to the Twitter pages on average per month and what percent of these folks are seeing content today versus a registration wall and then can you talk about maybe new products that might increase that level of engagement.
And then Anthony, you just made the comment that guidance is kind of the guidance going forward and that implies about 80% ad revenue growth in the fourth quarter versus the 110 to 130 we've seen over the last couple of quarters and the comp looks to be about the same.
So can you talk about where you think ad load is currently and what you -- is that the right way to think about the fourth quarter? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Thanks Ross. First on the logged out users, we haven’t provided specific metrics beyond the fact that our total audience consisting of logged in and logged out is 2X to 3X the size of the logged in and that hasn’t changed.
There are -- let me give you a little sense for qualitatively what's going on as opposed to giving you the specific numbers. We do know the specific numbers. We do study this. We're trying to create unique experience. Again each one of the four things I am going to articulate.
The first used case that a logged out user comes to Twitter is mainly to do a search on one of the major search engines person and that person clicks on hash tag, person's name and then come to Twitter to a profile page.
That is the one experience that we've actually experiment the most with and enhancing that profile page for the user and I'll share with you in a second on that on what we've seen since that initiative.
The second experience is when someone does a general search not on a name, it could be on a topic or it could on an area of interest, they would land just on a Tweet Detail page. No other tweets just that one tweet, no advertising, no merchandizing, no collaborative filtering, just literally that one tweet.
The third experience is when someone comes to our Home Page or Application and hasn’t logged in and is looking to probably do a search, but they're looking for what's going on right now, they get nothing. They have to log in and many people do not log in and they bounce off of that page.
The last experience is when someone sees one of our tweets on one of our syndicated partners like CNN or ESPN and they click on that tweet and come to our Application or our Home Page and that situation again, they'll get minimal content without logging in and so each one of these used cases is unique opportunity for us to create an experience that's immersive.
It gives the user the value that we have in content in both breadth and depth and brings them into Twitter in a way that they want to come to Twitter and not the way that we historically provided the information or the requirement for them to log in.
In terms of some stats on the profile pages, we launched the profile page and talked about it last quarter and we're measuring the impacts over that time period and what we've seen is an 83% increase in the number of profile impressions, a 77% increase in profile scrolls of the tweets on that profile page, over a 500% increase in media timeline impressions, over a 200% increase in media timeline scrolls, 11% increase in re-tweets on profiles and a 15% increase on favorites on profiles.
So this just starts to highlight how we're scratching the surface on giving these individuals unique content that meets their specific need on that specific used case in which they come and we'll continue to experiment with the user base to capture the opportunity.
And then in terms of the guidance, what I would say is this, our load rates or coverage as we refer to it remains very low. On a year-over-year basis, the bulk of our revenue growth, the majority of revenue growth came from click improvement, also coverage to contribute.
And what we do believe we've significant upside in the monetization of our user base as we've talked about previously and none of that has changed. The change in the guidance outlook is nothing more than we've been a public company for over a year.
We've a better understanding of the data that we have in quarter and it's predictability and have historically been there conservative and a highly confident number that we provide to the street and now we're just putting a little bit more of the balance towards the opportunities coming to fruition instead of equally balance between opportunities and risks.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank
Great. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thanks and so the next question comes from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of Rich Greenfield at BTIG and he asks, as you reengage with third party developers, why are you not syndicating ads to TweetDeck, Flipboard etcetera?
Dick Costolo
This is Dick. First of all let me just set come context for the comment around reengaging with third party developers. When we announced Fabric last week, our mobile software development platform, that platform is all about providing services to developers, mobile app developers across platforms from the day they start developing their applications to the day they launch those applications and want to measure growth to the day they need to monetize and want to monetize usage at scale.
When we think about the opportunity afforded by being part of the foundation of the entire mobile app landscape, we know that there are going to be enormous opportunities there. Those of course include helping developer monetize their apps which is why MoPub is such an integral part of the Fabric SDK.
We will think about and look for opportunities to provide our native advertising units in syndication both to other Twitter based properties like TweetDeck and across the entire mobile application ecosystem.
Krista Bessinger
Great, thank you. Operator, next question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
I want to ask about engagement trends and I know that in the past you've maybe had some misgivings or caveat in the views or looks on that timeline views per MAU. Any updated thinking on other metrics that you could disclose in the future that may have a better, give us a better picture on what's happening with the engagement?
And then secondly, if you just look at engagement trends amongst different cohorts whatever different cohorts you look at do you see anything in there that shows a real gap of opportunity? Did you have a kind of a profile, I mean a cohort in mind that shows dramatically higher than what your average engagement levels are and that's where you're trying to steer the rest of the user base to? Thank you.
Anthony Noto
Yeah what I'd say is timeline view per MAU remains our measurement for engagement that we disclosed publicly. We look at a lot of other measurements as well. In terms of the engagement with re-tweets and favorites and those trends all remain positive. What I'd say about timeline view per MAU, we spent a fair amount of time digging into the cohort analysis and in fact relatively encouraging.
If we look across 14 different cohorts the seven most recent cohorts which would be a cohort that just joined in the second quarter although back in time across 14 quarters, the seven most recent cohorts have lower timeline view per MAU than the seven oldest cohorts. But the trend that they show is they ultimately get to the average of those seven older cohorts. And we're seeing a convergence to that overall number.
It's just the newer cohorts start out lover and then as they become more familiar with the product, they become more engaged and they actually reach the levels that state that the older seven cohorts have. So it's actually an encouraging sign.
Dick mentioned that we have an aspirational goal having the largest audience in the world. We obviously do not provide the daily active user measurement. We really do not have specific initiative against that today. As those initiatives change in any or over time we could consider other measurements, but we're not doing that today.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Okay, thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs
Great thanks. Dick well I know you are focused on continuous improvement. When you think about the impact that your relatively new heads of product and engineering are having on the way that users see Twitter, how close are they to getting to what you would consider a normalized pace of development? And how would you characterize their vision for product and technology compared to what we've seen at Twitter over the past year?
Dick Costolo
Well, I would say that again I would go back to some of my initial comments and my remarks that I feel good about the strategy that we have in place and that we have been executing against over the course of the year and the quality of work that I'm seeing against that strategy.
As I mentioned, it is critical that we increase the pace of execution and you just referenced that. Let me talk about what I mean by that maybe in a little bit more detail.
When I talk about pace of execution, I'm really talking about faster iteration from hypothesis to prototyping against that hypothesis, to experimenting against that prototype, to launching against that experiment, and the iterating across that cycle.
It's that kind of clock speed and coordination that I want to see more of from product and engineering working together and that's a combination of both one, as a CEO I think you always want to see those kinds of things and then two, infrastructure capabilities we need to develop to enable the team to move more quickly.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs
Great, thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And the next question comes from Twitter, comes from the account of Victor Anthony of Topeka Capital Markets and he asks on the Q2 call you mentioned that there was nothing structural keeping you from monetizing at the same levels as other social networks. Over what timeframe do you see the gap closing and how are you getting there?
Anthony Noto
Yeah what I'd say is the overall statement holds true. We see nothing structurally preventing us from reaching the monetization levels of our industry peers and we needed about $10 of average revenue per user and getting to that level or higher. The key drivers from where we are today to getting there, today our load rate remains meaningfully below our industry peers and we have significant upside on absolute basis as well.
The drivers that will ultimately result in monetization at that level or higher that we've mentioned with first the advertisers, today, we continue to drive nice growth in advertisers and spend per advertiser as we continue to improve the ROI that we provide for them, but importantly continue to offer new product, new advertising products as I mentioned our promoted video ads as well as the improved SMB platform in addition to mobile app downloads and then web based cards.
These specific formats allow the advertisers pick the specific marketing tactic or initiative they want and better suit their needs, which provides better ROI.
So as we continue to do that improve the ROI then advertiser will growth meaningfully. And where we are today versus the numbers cited by industry peers is we're at a very, very, very, low level and we have magnitudes of upside there. That would be number one. As that demand increases we'd increase our cover to load factor to meet the demand.
Additionally, the more information we have and the better dashboards we have will drive continued higher quicker rates and that will result in better ROI. So it's a combination of those factors that allow us to really unlock the monetization opportunity that lies ahead of us. We continue to see nice improvements in the advertisers and the spend per advertiser and that's the bulk of what's driving it today. 
Krista Bessinger
Great, thank you. Operator, next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. The first question is on app downloads and video ads, how much did they contribute in 3Q and could those get big enough to kind of stem the rate of revenue deceleration as you look forward? And secondly, maybe a little bit more color on the deceleration in 4Q guidance and is there any FX impact? Thank you.
Anthony Noto
Thank you for your question. We're not providing the specific magnitude of revenue from app downloads or video. We're encouraged by both the quantity of revenue we've achieved in both of those products as well as the trend versus prior periods. Obviously the video promoted video is still in beta and we haven’t released it for general availability where app download has now been available for a quarter.
In terms of the FX impact, what I'd say is, it really depends on what your starting point is. If you go back to July 1, versus our guidance today, the magnitude of the impact of FX would be a negative of $5 million. I would just emphasized it depends on what point you pick to have that reference point.
In terms of the guidance for the fourth quarter, what I'd say is there is nothing inherent in that guidance that deviates from the other drivers of our business that we see and the only comment we have made philosophically is that it is a greater balance towards the opportunities coming to fruition versus an equal balance versus the risks.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Operator
The next question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital
At a high level just three to five years from now do you expect the majority of the revenue to be driven by the core logged in MAUs or it can be logged out and network users? And then more specifically on the Analyst Day what are the key focus area of the day is going to be and should we expect multiyear financial guidance? Thanks.
Dick Costolo
Yeah Ben, there's not a specific answer to your question three to five years from now, but the way I would qualitatively answer it is this, we always have a very large audience and logged out users to one to two acts the size of the monthly active logged in users. And so with a sizeable audience one that we feel confident we can monetize once we know the consumer experience and our approach has been to really now the consumer experience and to have high levels of engagement for introducing advertising.
Our advertising team, led by Adam Bain are very much in favor of being able to monetize this universe of users because they come with a very specific intent, especially when they are coming from a search engine or do a search on our own properties where they come from embedded tweet on someone else's property.
We know what their interest is and that's a key element of being able to target the advertising for them. So I think your question may be are they monetizable in our view is yes at the right point they are monetizable, but the exact magnitude differs between one versus the other. We would tell you our goals have the largest daily audience in the world and that will drive the largest value for shareholders.
In terms of Analyst Day, it's been a year since we went public and I would characterize the vision for Analyst Day in the following way. Our strategy has evolved over the last 12 months. It's a much more aspirational strategy and one that can allow the company to be much larger than just going after a logged in user base.
And so we wanted to at Analyst Day is lay out the opportunity that sits in front of us the specific strategy that we're using to capture it, where we are relative to that opportunity and what are the key priorities that lie ahead of us so you can track us relative to the opportunity. 
Krista Bessinger
Great, thank you. And the next question comes from Twitter. It comes from Daniel Ernst at Hudson Square and he asks would love to know DAU as a percent of MAU on the network on any given day.
Dick Costolo
So we get this question on every conference call and what I'd like to clarify is a couple of things. When the question is asked and what you DAU to MAU it depends on what time of the year it is and what portion of the overall user base you are focused on.
So I want to provide more specificity on this call and then just be very clear that we're not going to continue to update DAU to MAU until we have a specific strategy behind driving this measurement. So if you look at our top-five markets in the second and third quarter because there is seasonality differences, you'll see that in our top-five markets the DAU to MAU ratio is in the low 50% range.
If you look at our top 10 markets during that same time period, 2Q and 3 Q you'll see that our DAU to MAU is in the high 40s to low 50% range and if you look at our top 20 markets which make up 80% of overall user base you'll see in the second and third quarter that our DAU to MAU is in the high 40% range.
It is pretty consistent with what we've told in the past, but I want to make it clear that certain markets are above 50% and certain markets are below them depending if they are emerging market or not and also depends on what time of the year you ask the question.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. Next question please operator?
Operator
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Eric Sheridan – UBS
Thanks for taking the questions, so may be two, one, I wanted to know if we can get a little bit of color on self serve ad products, the countries and regions that have launched it what you've seen to date as those have launched and how that will form your view about going forward with self serve?
And then Anthony maybe I could take a swing one more time at the Q4 ad revenue. You are implying in the guidance where the comments made on the call that engagement actually gets a little bit better per MOU your timeline per MOU in Q4. So I wanted to dig in on the Q4 ad comment to whether that implies either ad load or price per ad might moderate in Q4? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
Thank you. On self serve what I'd tell you is we're very encouraged. We're not going to go through every country that was released in the most recent quarter we mentioned 12 of those and the footprint that it now covers.
What I would tell you is the number of SMB advertisers that are coming to Twitter using our advertising product accelerated in the quarter and that's a direct result of the adoption of the self serve platform and we're very encouraged by that.
In terms of Q4 guidance you know what I would say is our guidance reflects a combination of top-down and bottoms up and you're coming out from a bottoms up perspective. The top-down perspective is one driven by what we see already having been accrued in revenue in the quarter what we see in booked revenue and what we see in our pipeline revenue.
We do not. We're not constrained by supply. So your question implies that there could be some constraint there and what I will tell you is demand is the key driver of our revenue and demand is obviously a function of ROI and advertisers current businesses. And so that's what's reflected in our guidance.
Eric Sheridan – UBS
Thanks Anthony.

Our next question comes from Mark May from City. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Mark May - Citigroup
Thanks, I think most of it has been captured, but just wondering if you could talk a little about how the adoption of self-serve which I think is still kind of early in the process has helped improved coverage or sell through it or whatever you want to call it, and kind of where we are in that process, because we know from other similar businesses the adoption can be quite quick and I just want to get a sense of where we are in the process and how that's been impacting coverage?
And then a question around content, just wondering what role exclusive or unique content plays in the value that your users get from the service and what if anything that you guys are doing to kind of secure the rights to more exclusive and unique content from celebrities and other brands? Thanks.
Anthony Noto
On your first question in terms of self serve and impact on coverage, our self serve business is relatively small compared to our overall business, we're still a predominantly direct sales organization without accounting for the bulk of our revenue. The trends we see in self-serve are very promising, but it is very early days and it is not really having an impact on how much we have in load or coverage.
Dick Costolo
The answer to your second question Mark, this is Dick, is that that kind of unique content and I would say unique regional content around the world plays a very important role in the value we can deliver to our users and we have a global media team led by Katie Stanton who focuses specifically on securing that kind of unique content from all sorts of verticals, be it film, TV, music, politics, et cetera.
Krista Bessinger

Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities
Thanks. First for Anthony on international, can you just help us with the timing of the international expansion to those 12 additional markets in the quarter in Europe that you talked about in the release?
And then if I may what proportion of new MAUs in the quarter may have come from those 12 new markets versus the existing? And then for Dick on video you talked about exclusive video content in you’re prepared remarks, on the advertisers side you have promoted video in Beta are in experimentation mode with video at this point or should we start to see Twitter rollout video app products more aggressively from here?
Anthony Noto

Anthony, on the international comments the rollout over SMB markets internationally didn’t have an impact on MAU and I would tell you the initial performance financially from a market that’s opened into quarter doesn’t really have a significant impact on the overall SMB number. I think your MAU question I would answer in the following way.
We’ve done a number of different initiatives in the third quarter and the second quarter that we’ve gone back and have been able to tie the specific results of those initiatives against outcomes.
And in the third quarter if you think about our MAU growth and the 13 million MAUs that we announced, about 3.3 million of those came from specific actions that we took and contribute their adoptions to the platform from and they would form the categories like discovery notification.
Which leads you roughly 9.8 million that came from what I would call organic growth, the actual number for organic without the negative impact that I mentioned from the authentication bug would have been an 11.8 but it turns out to be 9 point because of that bug. 
So we drove 3.3 million net MAU growth sequentially from exclusive actions we took in the categories of discovery notification. And that was a little bit better than what we saw in the second quarter it was 3.1 million. 
Dick Costolo
Hey Anthony, this is Dick. Regarding your question about rolling out video products more generally speaking, I would say yes a reference in my opening remarks that we want to focus on communicating through media and delivering both creation and consumption experiences that are more media centric and that applies to both images and video absolutely.
So you will see us invest in both on the user side of that and in the Amplify side of that, Amplify being our professional video brought into the platform. I guess I’ll leave it to Anthony to comment on the advertising services related to video that we're providing.
Anthony Noto
And so today in the video side of the business we have two add products, one is Amplify which we launched last year remains a very important advertising vehicle where we partner with key content owners like the NFL.
The second part is what we just release in beta which is promoted video which has got an very nice uptick an as you know well mobile obviously is benefiting from the secular advertising trend, additionally social advertising is benefiting from a secular trend and video mobile, social is even better.
So we’re happy to have a product in this specific segment for our advertisers and so for the adoption has been really positive.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities
Ok, thanks.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks and the next question we are going to take from Twitter comes from the account of [Krim Delco] (ph) and he or she asks, are there any events this quarter that are similar to the World Cup last quarter that drove engagement and what did you learn from that?
Dick Costolo
Yeah, so the one thing I’d like to make clear is when we did World Cup last quarter it was an experience that was focused on monthly active users and was not broadly advertised to nonusers and we saw nice engagement with the product, but we didn’t see an impact on monthly active users.
And we’ve gone back and looked at the numbers a number of times now that we’re in the second quarter and want you have the same confidence that we have that the World Cup did not have an impact on monthly active users in the second quarter and then I’ll give you a sense for what we’ve done in the third quarter as it may have been similar to the World Cup.
As it relates to the second quarter monthly active users contribute to the World Cup, what we would say is the following; in Europe there was no change in monthly active user growth over the time of the world Cup. In fact monthly active user grow slowed in line with expected seasonality in each successful month of the World Cup.
In Latin America there was a slight acceleration of net ads on the World Cup, but at most of the World Cup added 600,000 users which is immaterial and quite frankly we probably saw a derogation of those users in the following month before the quarter ended. The U.S. actually added more net ads this quarter than last quarter which is interesting on a sequential basis.
We added 3.6 million net adds in Q3 versus Q2 and in Q2 we added 2.6 million net ads versus Q1. In terms of what have we done in this quarter, we have currently in the marketplace hashtag NFL and hashtag NFL leveraged the technology that we talked about or will be repeatable on other tailored timelines and other event timelines.
We pulled together with the hashtag NFL initiative very late in the summer. You will continue to see it improve as it has since the season started. We currently don’t have live scores. You can expect that to come over time. We've seen a nice influx of unique content from NFL teams, the NFL league as a whole and then a number of media properties.
And quite frankly one of the experience is nowhere near what we think it can be over time as we continue to evolve it. The most encouraging thing I've seen is the amount of content that's been created by the NFL and the NFL teams themselves that's going into that timeline.
I can't remember the last time the NFL actually created content for another third party to use at no cost.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks Anthony. Operator next question please.

Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Pardon me Mr. Squali. Please check your mute button.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Can you hear me?
Operator
Yes sir, please go ahead.
Dick Costolo
The next question please.
Operator
And our next question comes from Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brian Wieser - Pivotal Research
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just refining an earlier question, you mentioned APAC and EMEA performed well, but I was wondering if you could call any particular international markets that stood out for revenue growth, but also for net user additions, I was wondering what you thought roughly user growth was particularly pronounced.
And separately you mentioned your last Q that I guess it was 8.5% of equity users used publications automatically contacting your servers with the user initiated action as the phrasing goes. I am curious if there is an updated stat for the supporter?
Dick Costolo
Yes, on your second question, 11% of our monthly active users come solely to third party clients, so that's just the third party client part of what we disclosed last time and your specific question, third party client and the use that maybe auto-pulling and you emphasized the word maybe, was approximately 8.5%, really there were two things we disclosed.
The first was MAUs. Registered MAUs coming solely through third party clients was approximately 11.5% and the third party client MAUs that maybe auto-pulling was approximately 8.5%.
And then in terms of user growth, the user growth is seasonal in different regions. We know that Japan continues to be a very strong contributor to growth and we see growth in many of the other Asia markets as well, but Japan is the largest of the strength in APAC markets, so to give you some more additional detail.
Brian Wieser - Pivotal Research
And inside of Europe, are you seeing any particular markets that are outperforming in terms of year-over-year revenue growth?
Dick Costolo
We're not going to get into the specific detail, but Europe continues to be a nice contributor overall revenue growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. It was the second largest contributor to the sequential growth in revenue as a whole and APAC was the largest contributor outside the United States of course.
Brian Wieser - Pivotal Research
Okay. Thank you very much.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Operator next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Arvind Bhatia from Sterne Agee. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee
Yes, thanks for taking the question. Related mainly to the user growth discussion, I was wondering if you guys when you think about the ratio of logged out to logged on users, if you see any material differences across various geographies?
And then also in the fourth quarter, are there any events that you would like to call out for the last year that are not repeatable that we should keep in mind? I know you had your IPO for example.
Dick Costolo
Yes, thank you for your question. In terms of logged out users versus logged in, on a geographic basis we're not prepared to share any deltas of segmented information at this point in time beyond the overall user size and then obviously the user cases that we have today with them.
As it relates to our outlook for monthly active users, I gave a couple of piece of information and specific intent around timeline use per MAU and revenue per timeline view and then of course overall revenue. The combination of those three inputs will give you a range of outcomes for our outlook for MAU growth in the fourth quarter and is the best indicator to how to think about it.
Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee
Okay. Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Operator we'll take the next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Blackledge from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company
Great thanks. Just two questions. On promoted video, could you just talk about who the beta advertisers are and how long you expect it to be in beta? And then Anthony, I think you mentioned the engagement cohort analysis that you did. For the oldest cohorts, what's the trajectory of their engagement? Is it growing flat or down? Thank you.
Anthony Noto
On the promoted video, we're not disclosing specific advertisers. Obviously, Twitter is public and so you could spend some time going through your home timeline and see a number of instances in which we have big branded advertisers advertising promoted video tweets on the platform in addition to amplify, which is the other form of video that we have.
In terms of the oldest cohorts, so we're anniversarying the big changes that we made in media [forward] (ph) last year in the third quarter and that had an impact on last year's fourth quarter. In fact, our timeline views per MAU in the fourth quarter of 2013 were down 10% sequentially. So we actually have a quite easy comp there.
As you think about the cohorts, the older cohorts even though they're anniversarying those changes are relatively stable and there is a possibility that those cohorts over time will continue to increase, but right now they're still seeing those product changes that make it more efficient for them to find our content quickly as opposed to having spiraled through timeline view after timeline view to get to the score the Giants versus the Royals last night or a conversation that took place around that.
So they are stable, the cohorts timeline view per MAU are stable, but they're still -- they're still anniversarying some of those changes and without those changes, they could possibly [indiscernible].
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company
That's great. If I could ask just one question, can you talk about ad targeting ability of Twitter versus industry peers? I know you gave some other benchmarks for Twitter versus industry peers, how do you view your ad targeting ability. Thank you so much.
Anthony Noto
We think we have and Dick has mentioned the interest graph and how it gives is so many signals about an individual of interest and that is very valuable to advertisers, we obviously do ROI now, it's an attribution analysis to compare ourselves versus competitors and we couldn’t feel better about the value that we provide to advertisers.
If you think about it the toughest advertisers that went over are those advertisers the top of the pyramid, the big branded advertisers and we've had great success and have started with the most challenging advertiser and the only way to continue to drive increased spend per advertiser, which we're seeing in our biggest channel the DSO channel still today is by delivering that ROI.
So I would tell you that's the best way to measure us is the fact that our average revenue per advertiser in DSO is still growing.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company
Thank you.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thanks. And our next question comes from Twitter. It comes from the Twitter account of [Carter Mansbach] (ph) and here she asks are there any plans to monetize Vine?
Dick Costolo
Yes, this is Dick. Thanks for the question Carter. I would say that our near term and immediate term focus in Vine are continuing to build beautiful content creation tools or all of the users of that service.
We have some really world-class content creation capabilities there that are allowing people to create these one of a kind experiences that you can only get on Vine and we want to continue to invest behind that.
When I talked earlier about broadly speaking investing in communicating through media as a company, that of course applies to Vine and that will be our continued focus for the foreseeable future.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks Dick. And I think we have time now for just one just one last question. So operator we'll take our final question please.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question comes from Brian Nowak from SIG. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Brian Nowak – Susquehanna Financial Group
Thanks. I have two please. The first one Anthony you made a lot of changes to improve the user experience and the on-boarding. I was wondering if you could talk about rough user churn rates now or even direct certainly whether they're going up or down?
And then secondly, on the quarterly MAUs, understanding that they're lumpy and every seasonal, can you just talk to the rough size of the impact of the India elections as well as the [soft] (ph) and news events?
And then did you see a benefit from the Brazil Presidential election that you -- as well as the U.S. midterm election that you're embedding in the 4Q guidance?
Anthony Noto
Thanks Brian. So on the user experience, one of the things you mentioned, new user experience that we launched, I would like to share with you a few stats on the performance that we've seen since we launched the new user experience.
First, after 30 days after launching we saw the number of new users that allowed us to have access to their contacts increased by 2X, which is an important piece of data that we can use to build a timeline for them and to also drive other engagement factors down the road.
Additionally we saw 13% increase in those that have started the registration process actually making it to the home timeline and getting the benefit of all the great content we have and then we saw a 200% increase in the number of accounts followed, again an important measurement that ensure that we're delivering value to these new users as they come on Board.
So in addition to reducing the number of steps it takes to be a new user from 12 steps to approximately six or seven and building our a very strong and robust timeline, we're seeing an improvement in some of the underlying metrics.
In terms of the funnel dynamics I would say, nothing has really changed significantly on the funnel dynamics and that the changes that we're making will over time improve the funnel dynamics, but we're focused on both the top of the funnel as well as the bottom of the funnel.
Brian Nowak – Susquehanna Financial Group
And then on the quarterly MAUs.
Anthony Noto
In terms of your specific question as it relates to India and South Korea, it was around 1.2 million users in total.
Brian Nowak – Susquehanna Financial Group
And then did you see a bump from Brazil yesterday and are you expecting a bump from the U.S. midterm as you in the fourth quarter and your guidance.
Anthony Noto
We don't comment on specific events into the quarter. Use the three variables that I gave you to triangulate to the overall view for the fourth quarter.
Brian Nowak – Susquehanna Financial Group
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thanks everyone for joining us. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Twitter Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference Krista Bessinger, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Ma’am you may begin.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks, Sam and good afternoon. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call and thank you for joining us. We have with us today our CEO, Dick Costolo; Current CFO and SVP of Strategic Investments, Mike Gupta and incoming CFO, Anthony Noto. We'll begin with approximately 15 minutes of prepared remarks followed by Q&A. During the Q&A, we will take questions submitted via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the #TWTRearnings.
We'd like remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call, such as our outlook for Q3 and 2014 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our earnings release. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Also, please see our earnings slide deck posted on our IR site for additional information about metrics we will discuss on this call. An audio replay of this call will also be available via Twitter and on our Web site in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Dick Costolo.
Dick Costolo
Thanks, everyone for joining us this afternoon. We had a strong quarter. We made progress on multiple fronts across the business and our financial performance was truly exceptional. I would like to run through a few highlights here and then we can dive into the details. We generated $312 million in revenue which represents 124% growth on a year-on-year basis, that’s our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Ad revenue growth also continues to be remarkably strong, and accelerating to 129% year-over-year. That growth is primarily driven by higher engagement which translates into improved ROI for our marketers.
Our monthly active users also grew to 271 million in the quarter, an increase of 16 million, the highest number of absolute net new user adds in five quarters. And then finally, we generated $54 million in adjusted EBITDA, more than doubling margins year-over-year to 17%. Later on the call, Mike will provide more details on this past quarter’s results and Anthony will talk more about our going forward outlook. I would like to start by talking a little bit about the progress we are making on our consumer products.
First, during the World Cup, we delivered a kind of events experience that I have wanted to see from us for some time. We served up tailored experiences for each individual match and for the overall World Cup and these experiences felt alive. They felt wonderfully complementary to the matches themselves. That has given me confidence that we can create great user experiences by organizing content around topics and live events. Second, we have a team focused specifically on building a fast and frictionless Twitter experience for users in geographies with sub-optimal connectivity. We are seeing really positive results from the work there and I am excited about our growth opportunity in developing markets around the world.
I want to continue to highlight the reach and impact of Twitter across the mobile landscape beyond our owned and operated properties. As one example, during the Germany-Brazil World Cup game alone, we had approximately 2 billion Tweet impressions off of Twitter in addition to the 4.4 billion impressions on Twitter’s owned and operated properties. So, it’s nearly 6.5 billion impressions in a single match, highlights the continued expansion of our global reach and impact.
And beyond our 271 million monthly active users, there are hundreds of millions of additional unique visitors who come to Twitter every month but don’t log-in. When you consider the combination of monthly active users and unique visitors, the size of our audience on our owned and operated properties is two to three times that of just our monthly active user base, which we believe ranks us among the top-10 largest digitally connected audiences in the world.
We have started to experiment with improving the experience for this group of unique visitors. Profile pages are an example of the limited content we offer to unique visitors who come to Twitter and don’t log-in today. In the last quarter, we improved profile pages to make them more engaging, more visually appealing to everybody who comes to Twitter, whether they are logged-in or logged-out. And we will run experiments and continue to run experiments to improve the overall experience for logged-out unique visitors. To be very clear, our central focus remains on improving product experiences for our monthly active user base. But make no mistake, our total audience and reach represent a significant opportunity and we will continue to invest in maximizing the size of our audience.
We are already the world’s real-time information network and by giving everyone the best of Twitter, no matter where or how they consume our content, logged-in as unique visitors or in syndication we will position ourselves to reach the largest audience in the world and every person on the planet. I want to conclude my introductory remarks by expressing my personal thanks for Mike, who as you saw will be transitioning from the CFO role into a new one, heading the Company’s strategic investments. I am excited obviously for Mike and for the Company as he takes on this new challenge. And we have also brought on a stellar individual in our new CFO Anthony Noto, who will join us for Q&A and looking forward guidance. Mike and I had the good fortune to work closely with Anthony during our IPO process and we are lucky to now get to work day-to-day with him in-house.
With that I will hand it over to Mike to jump into the financials.
Mike Gupta

Thanks, Dick and good afternoon everyone. I will discuss our financial and operating performance for Q2 and then hand it over to Anthony to cover guidance before we open the call for your questions. Q2 was another very strong quarter for Twitter with continued acceleration across both total revenue and ad revenue on a year-over-year basis. Total revenue reached $312 million, up 124% from the year ago period, faster than the year-over-year growth we saw in the prior three quarters. Ad revenue reached $277 million, up 129% from last year. This is the highest rate of year-over-year growth that we have seen in advertising revenues in the last six quarters.
Strength in our advertising business is broad-based across all channels and geographies with particular strength in international markets due to strong advertiser demand around the World Cup. Our promoted products continue to deliver high levels of engagement and marketers are increasing budget and spending in response to the ROI that they are seeing on our platform.
In Q2, international revenue accounted for 33% of total revenue, up 168% year-over-year. We now have a sales presence in more than 40 countries around the world. And we see a significant room for international revenue growth as we continue to expand the direct sales, sales support staff, reseller efforts and the continued roll-out of our self-service advertising platform. In Q2, we introduced self serve ads in three new countries Spain, Israel and South Africa. While self-serve advertising touches less than 40% of our global user base today, we intend to roll-out our self-serve platform to many more countries over the course of the year.
Mobile also continued to be a strong driver in the quarter with 81% of total ad revenue generated from mobile devices. This is up from 67% in the prior year. Data licensing and other revenue contributed $35 million in the quarter, an increase of 90% year-over-year. This line item includes significant contributions from both our mobile ad exchange and the Gnip data licensing business.
Turning to expenses, unless otherwise noted, my comments will focus on our non-GAAP financial measures which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and income tax effects related to acquisitions. For the GAAP financial measures as well as the reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release posted on our IR Web site. In Q2, total expenses were $296 million, up 94% year-over-year. The increase was driven primarily by headcount and related overhead cost as we continue to invest in our workforce, scale our business and drive continued product innovation. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,300 employees.
Operating expense by line item was as follows; cost of sales for the second quarter was $80 million, R&D costs were $85 million, sales and marketing costs were $101 million, and general and administrative costs were $35 million. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of $54 million compared to $10 million in the prior year period, representing an EBITDA margin of 17% in Q2, more than double year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $15 million in the second quarter, up from a non-GAAP net loss of approximately $16 million in the same period a year ago. Our GAAP net loss in the second quarter was $145 million which includes $158 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Before turning to metrics, I will cover a few items related to cash and CapEx. We ended the quarter with roughly $2.1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Cash flow from operations is $82 million and CapEx was $75 million, $31 million of which was financed through capital leases, the remaining 44 million was purchased outright.
Now I would like to turn to our operating metrics, as Dick mentioned, ongoing product improvements are continuing to drive growth across all key metrics including users, engagement and monetization. First on users, we saw improved growth in monthly active users in the second quarter with average MAUs reaching 271 million, reflecting 16 million net additions, up from 14 million Q1. We saw strong growth in both U.S. and international markets. U.S. MAUs reached 60 million, reflecting 3 million net additions in the second quarter, consistent with the 3 million net additions we saw in Q1. And international MAUs reached 211 million, reflecting 13 million net additions, up from 11 million net additions in Q1.
Timeline views increased to approximately 173 billion, up 22 billion or 15% from the same quarter last year and up 16 billion or 11% from the first quarter. Timeline views per MAU were also up modestly quarter-over-quarter. Note, that these timeline view metrics do not include the curated World Cup experience that Dick spoke about earlier.
Going forward, we will continue to improve the product to make it easier and more efficient for users to find the content they are looking for. As we succeed in doing this, we expect to see the current trend of year-over-year declines in timeline views per MAU to continue along with improving interactions for timeline views consistent with what we have seen in recent periods.
Switching to monetization, ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views continues to accelerate, reaching $1.60 in Q2, up 100% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. U.S. ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views reached $3.87, up 79% year-over-year. And international ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views reached $0.75, up 152% year-over-year. We continue to see steady improvement in monetization and we expect those trends to continue. We do not see any structural reason that the levels of monetization for our monthly active users can’t reach or exceed that of our industry peers overtime.
In Q2, ad revenue grew 129% on a year-over-year basis, despite a 35% decline in cost per ad engagements. The increase was driven by total ad engagements which grew more than 250% year-over-year, reflecting higher quality ads, improved prediction and targeting and the increased use of rich media by advertiser. On a sequential basis cost per ad engagement increased 18%. This is our first increase in reported CP that was due impart to strong advertiser demand around the World Cup and a mix shift towards higher performing and higher priced ad units. Ad engagements also increased 4% quarter-over-quarter, significantly improving overall yield.
Before turning it over to Anthony for the financial outlook, I want to take a moment to say thank you. As Dick mentioned, I will be transitioning out of the CFO role to head up Twitter’s strategic investment arm. Over the past few weeks, I have been working closely with Anthony to ensure a successful transition. I am looking forward to starting my new role and importantly I continue to be optimistic about the future of Twitter.
With that, here is Anthony.
Anthony Noto

Thank you, Mike. I am incredibly excited to be here and it’s a privilege to be part of the Twitter team especially given the opportunity in front of us. I want to highlight a couple of recent initiatives on the advertising front before turning to guidance. We have had great success in advertising, helping fuel our growth has not only been the success of our existing products, but also the steady pace at which we have brought new advertising products to market. Our innovation continues. Just a few weeks ago we announced the general availability of our mobile app promotion suite both emerging apps as well as brands in highly competitive categories are seeing great results.
In August, we will launch the beta version of our new promoted video offering which provides a way for high quality content producers and brands easily upload, share and measure the distribution and effectiveness of their video content on Twitter. And finally, we have closed the acquisition of TapCommerce, an important asset we have added to our mobile ad technology stack. Now with our existing ad tech stack, we can help advertisers drive conversions and ROI with mobile consumers on and off of Twitter.
With that I want to now switch to outline our guidance for Q3 and the full year of 2014 then Dick, Mike and I will take your questions.
For the third quarter of 2014, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $330 million to $340 million with an adjusted EBITDA in the range of $40 million to $45 million. We also expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $180 million to $190 million. For full year 2014 for total revenue, we are raising our range to $1.310 billion to $1.330 billion which is $95 million above our previous range at the midpoint. The increase in revenue guidance for full year of 2014 reflects our Q2 outperformance and our increased expectations for the remainder of the year.
Moving onto adjusted EBITDA, stock-based compensation and CapEx, we are raising our range for adjusted EBITDA to $210 million to $230 million. We continue to expect stock-based compensation expense to be in the range of $640 million to $690 million. We continue to expect CapEx to be between $330 million and $390 million.
With that, I would like to take your questions. Operator, if you would please announce the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities

Two questions, one for Dick and one for Anthony, Dick you talked in your prepared remarks about the growth of off-network. So how big Twitter can be over and above kind of just the existing Twitter users? And I just wondered you talk about impressions, if you could talk a little bit about what that contribution could be in terms of revenue perhaps what off-network revenue was in the quarter? And then just thinking about how should I, how should we think about revenue per user in the context in fact that’s probably more -- probably an increasing percentage of your revenue is coming from off-network?
And then Anthony if I may, you were at the NFL, one of the biggest media enterprise in the world, you’ve been a media analyst, you’ve been a media Internet banker, we’d just love to hear you talk about the opportunity that you see for Twitter as a media company as opposed to Twitter as a social network perhaps? And then within that, where do you see the curation of content fitting into that equation for example reverse chronological on the timeline do you think that changes and where do you see Amplify fitting into Twitter’s media strategy? Thanks.
Dick Costolo

Thanks, Anthony, this is Dick. So as regard to your first question which was in relation to my prepared remarks about our reach and impact off of Twitter and the World Cup impressions in syndication and then the size of the logged out audience, I will say this: we see that as a big opportunity obviously. Why are we sharing all that information with you now? One is we’ve made changes we like to the profile pages that make them more engaging and visually appealing and that has led us to be excited about other experiments that will be running for those audiences and those -- as those changes become more visible to you, I want you to have context for why you are seeing them vis-à-vis revenue contribution of those audiences, we’re focused 100% on user experience today and we are not monetizing those audiences. As we eventually think about that, it will probably over the long term in the context of the way we same kinds of ad units we deliver to our own network logged in users but we are focused right now on leveraging the content that’s created by the majority of those 271 million monthly active users that come to the site to create the appropriate experiences for both the unique visitors and syndicated audience.
Anthony Noto

In terms of the opportunity for Twitter, I wouldn’t try to characterize this as a media company, or a technology company, the bulk of our employees are technology people and so we’ve always said that we are a technology company first and we are using a very simple format with a very complicated technology to be able to become the largest information network in the world. And I came here with one belief and since being here, that belief has only been reinforced and that’s that we can build the largest audience in the world. Dick talked about that in his prepared remarks and that’s something I came here believing was the case and I believe it more now that I have been here for five weeks.
To your point about curation fit, what I would say is Dick made some comments about tailored audiences and tailored audiences are challenging to do and the company has did a enormously successful job as it relates to the World Cup in creating a tailored experience for those that were interested in it to really drive engagement. I think Twitter is unique in that most technology companies disrupt other industries and disrupt other business, but Twitter actually makes other companies and other brands better than it otherwise be. I think that’s a unique complementary nature of our information network that really makes us partner with so many types of companies which increases the amount of information we have and content which aggregates a larger audience and it just continue that virtual cycle.
As it relates to the third part of your question Amplify fit, Amplify is a great example how Twitter makes other companies and brands better. Amplify allows us to partner with TV companies or content creators, increase the tune-in to their audiences. One example you mentioned the NFL, last year Twitter created a partnership with the NFL help drive tune in. This summer their games during the week that were less viewed or there was a lower awareness of the product beyond being on days other than Sunday and Amplify is the perfect example of how we can increase that tune-in, create a bigger audience for the content producer and the content licenser which drives more advertising dollars ultimately it will pay more for that content and that content producer want to partner with Twitter.

Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now opened.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan

First I was hoping that you could just comment on the trajectory of MAUs through the months of 2Q and then you talked about how it’s more products and the experiences rather than the World Cup itself, but how do you maintain some of the new users that may have come in around that event? And then can you also just comment on your early thoughts on commerce on the platform and how that’s rolling out through cards at this early stage how successful that’s been? Thanks.
Dick Costolo

Sure Doug. Thank you. On the trajectory of MAUs we don’t give a perspective on each monthly MAU number but on overall quarter as mentioned we’re quite pleased with the outcome of 60 million new monthly active users sequentially, but the thing I would note which needs to be clear is that the World Cup itself didn’t really add to the MAU net ads it helped drive engagement and it is a product that is really focused on engagement the way we have positioned it now. So in terms making end users you don’t really see that we benefited from new MA user growth because of the World Cup.
The last question you asked was about commerce I think Nathan Hubbard is leading that charge for us we’re excited about it commerce has been occurring on Twitter for some time even before the initiatives that Nathan is behind. We recently completed the acquisition of CardSpring which is an important proportional platform so it complements our commerce strategy and we’re very excited about the opportunities lies ahead of us and we’ll give you further updates as they occur.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan

Thank you.
Krista Bessinger

Great, thank you. And the next question comes from the Twitter account of Colin Sebastian at R. W. Baird and he asks, how much usage improvement is attributable to the World Cup and are the buy buttons indicative on an ecommerce push?
Dick Costolo

Thanks Colin, this is Dick. As I mentioned and as Anthony has reinforced it’s really been the case that the World Cup experiences drove engagement, increased engagement from our existing users and it’s been the product changes that we’ve made over the course of the year that have driven new user growth. So that’s how I would categorize that, vis-à-vis the buy button specifically that’s another example of the kinds of explorations we’ve got Nathan and his team are focused on and you will continue to see explorations and other experiments like that.

Our next question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs

Great, thanks. Dick is it possible to parse some of the impact that you’re seeing from the new features and some of the user services that you’ve rolling out over the course of the last couple quarters in terms of what that’s having on users and engagement and as Daniel begins to have his finger prints more on the user experience, what kind of I guess sort of road map or timeline would have investors thinking about in terms of really seeing his version of what Twitter is going to look like.
Dick Costolo

Thanks Heath. So vis-à-vis your question about parsing the impact from new users on MAU and/or engagement I would say that we don’t think of it that way and view it as the collection of changes that we’re making in service to delivering value more immediately to users when they come to the platform and create account to log in that are driving that growth. It’s the combination of those things that we have described from the beginning of the year that we’re moving forward on now and not -- we don’t slice those up by feature vis-à-vis the road map and the timelines being Daniel’s vision for Twitter I would say a couple of things specifically.
One, the product road map that we talked to you about at the beginning of the year and last quarter is the road map that we continue to leverage and continue to move down the path on and those include organizing content for new users and as I mentioned in my remarks I loved the way we did that during the World Cup with those experiences making it easier to on-board new users and as I mentioned last quarter the continued work on the direct messaging platform that we will be focus the remainder of the year.
Not only has Daniel made a great impact in coming to the company along with Anthony and quickly I would say quickly integrated into the fabric of the way we do things here but we’ve also added a number of other folks to the product team or the product leadership team that have done a similarly great job and I like the way they have come in adopted the work that the teams have already been doing in service to their road map and are continuing with that same road map down the future path.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now opened.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank

Thanks guys. Just another product related question I guess for Dick. So following up on the comments on non-logged-in experiences, what kind of additional products could we see for that cohort of users? And there has been some chatter out there that Twitter could at some point roll out timeline based on algorithm versus self curation or setting up your own follow list, how complicated is that and how long until we could potentially see a product like that shift? Thanks.
Dick Costolo

Yes. Thanks Ross. Vis-à-vis the additional products we could see I mentioned that I really again the kinds of experiences we created around topics and live events during the World Cup. We will run a number of experiments to that broader audience those unique visitors I talked about and I wouldn’t want to be specific about the sequence with which roll those out or when you would see those. On your second question, algorithmic timelines for example versus manually curated follow lists I think it’s fair to say that we are not ruling out any kinds of changes that we might deliver in the product in service to bridging that gap between signing up for Twitter and receiving immediate value and you will see a number of kinds of experiments that we produce there. 
Krista Bessinger

Thank you. Our next question comes from the Twitter account of Rich Greenfield at BTIG and he has a two part question. The first part of the question is about U.S. user growth and he says, what is the biggest challenge to growing domestic users to 100 million plus? Does the product need to radically change?
Dick Costolo

Yes. Thanks Rich, it’s Dick. The short answer is as I just referred to, it’s that delivering immediate value to new users when they come to the platform and signup for Twitter and shortening that distance between signup and receiving immediate value and no, the product does not need to radically change, we have everything we need to deliver that value to users.
Krista Bessinger

And the next part of Richard’s question is about time line used for MAU. He says U.S. timeline use for MAU fell sequentially, why? Are new users increasingly lighter or less engaged users?
Dick Costolo

So in terms of first part of the question, as it relates to U.S. timeline use per MAU falling sequentially, the U.S. market benefit in the first quarters from some big event to drive engagement specifically the SuperBowl as well as the Oscars and those events are not repeated in the second quarter including the World Cup which we didn’t count timelines for. So that’s why you see that trend in U.S., timeline use per MAU. As it related to the bigger question, our new users increasingly lighter or less engaged users, we would say that the trend that you are seeing currently in timeline use per MAU is really driven by product changes as the predominant driver of that decline.
And essentially what we are trying to do is reduce every friction that exists. When a user comes online to find information, they want quickly and easily. And we’ve made small product changes overtime such as media port and other initiatives that make it a lot of easier for someone to find that they want and consume more during the time that they are on Twitter. And so we really encouraged by the trends we are seeing behind these initiatives and we will continue them as Mike mentioned in his prepared remarks.

Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities

So Dick a question for you, third-party data suggests that twitting activity along users who signed up in 2012 and 2013 is declining on a sequential basis. First of all is that the case or not sure of course? And then secondly, how should we think about that given that marketers tell us that Twitters are more valuable than passive non-twitting users from an engagement perspective. Particularly when it comes to re-twitting and earned media from an advertizing perspective? Thanks very much.
Dick Costolo

Yes, thanks Peter. I am not going to comment on any third party data or rumors. It remains the case that the majority of our monthly active users are content creators on the platform that includes twitting, replying to twits, et cetera. To your second question, our marketers receive value from everyone who engages with their twits. And neither we nor our marketers make a distinction between whether a active user on the platform as they customer of theirs is a Twitter or non-Twitter and I think that it’s reasonable to assume that all of our monthly active users get engaged with our marketers on the platform are just as valuable to them as any other cohort for the active user.

Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now opened.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch 

My questions are really on high level on ad loads and engagement. I am just wondering if you could tell us where you feel you are on advertising loads. Do you still see a lot of room there? And then on engagement, obviously tremendous growth there, maybe you could call out a few of the fabs that are driving higher engagement, are they ad formats on Twitter cards or is it just better targeting overall by your algorithms? So maybe give us a little help on that. Thank you.
Dick Costolo
In terms of ad loads, what I’d say is they increased marginally on a quarter-over-quarter basis but they are still very low relative to our industry peers and even the best in class industry peers we still feel like. We have significant upside as it relates to ad load or coverage. As a least engagement, I think it’s important to understand that overtime, as we add new ad formats such as we did this quarter with mobile app downloads, it will have an impact on engagement rates or clicking rates. Specifically to think about the app download card, it’s a card that we don’t get paid and look for with the paper performance mechanism is when the individual clicks on the twit is actually is in the click on the install button and this is a much higher hurdle than just clicking on the twit or re-twitting or some other mechanism to drive engagement. And because that action is further down the funnel, the clicking rates slightly lower but the price that the advertiser is going to pay is higher and that’s a great trade off and we will continue to add different types of add format that could have that type of impact on the mix overall.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Let me follow up. You mentioned a benchmarking versus competitors. When you look at some of the big competitors, do you think your activity as far as time or page views or timeline views is comparable as you think of that some of the other big social networks out there? Thanks
Dick Costolo
We can make an apples-to-apples comparison as it relates to the commonly used term ad load and that’s what I am making the reference point from.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

We love the partner as I mentioned earlier Twitter makes other brands and their content better and so we benefit from a ton of world-class partners. The NFL is a partner, last year as I have mentioned we entered into relationship as it related to Amplify Dick mentioned we will continue to look at opportunities to create tailored experiences and so that’s one area and Sports League is something we can look at as we do the World Cup and I know someone at the NFL so maybe I will reach out.

Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Eric Sheridan - UBS

Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two on costs, one on the gross margin was up very big year-on-year. I wanted to understand what is driving that improvement in gross margins and how sustainable it is on a going forward basis? And then Anthony on the guide for Q3 it applies EBITDA margins actually go back the other way I wonder what sort of investments might be driving a treat in the EBITDA margin in Q3 based on the guidance you gave since it wasn’t called out on the call? Thanks. 
Mike Gupta
Yes hey Eric it is Mike. Just on the gross margin year-over-year what we’re seeing again is as we’ve talked about it as we make these investments into the infrastructure to make sure we can scale with users and usage we’re seeing leverage come into that model as we improve the structure of our infrastructure in those investments. So really it’s just the scale kicking in overtime that you are seeing on a year-over-year basis. And we continue to optimize that infrastructure spend to make sure we’re doing it the most efficient way possible.
Dick Costolo

And then Eric on second part of your question as it relates the guidance I would first start by saying philosophically as we think about guidance, we really want to balance the opportunities versus the risks in a quarter when we give you guidance and that’s what the outlook represents. As it relates to sort of the specific margin question I’ll tell you we want a balanced growth versus investment, the multitude of growth opportunity we have in front of us is enormous and we don’t want in anyway short change the long-term size of the business or opportunity to become largest audience in the world. And so we also want to be prudent though that we’re not investing without any constraint.
And if you look at our fiscal year 2014 guidance as a whole we’re guiding to almost 100% year-over-year revenue growth with margin expansion up about 500 to 600 basis points which is a significant amount of profit improvement relative to that fast growth rate. So as you think about the third quarter specifically want to make sure that we’re still investing in the growth opportunities the second quarter 75% of the upside revenue dropped to the bottom line we would have liked to have spend some of that back given the multitude of growth opportunities we have and just didn’t have the ability to do it quick enough so we are going do in the third quarter but still for the full year really deliver that balance of growth and profitability.

Our next question comes from Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now opened.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald 

Thank you very much. Two quick questions, first Dick you talked about the hundreds of millions of unique that come to Twitter but don’t log in, just trying to understand why they don’t log in, is it a friction in the process or is it a lack of a value proposition that these guys are seeing and clearly what is it that you’re actually doing short-term to kind of remediate there? And then on the -- my other question is around the MoPub maybe can you just refresh us on the opportunity around that acquisition and it is performance and contribution to the quarter? Thank you.
Dick Costolo

Sure. Thanks Youssef. The answer to your first question, Twitter is everywhere right it’s all over TV when the NBA commissioner gets on TV and talked about his sanctions against Donald Sterling there are twits all along bottom of the screen during the course of that discussion. When events happen in the world whether it’s the joy of the World Cup or the tragedy of MH-17 all over television all over the news, all over the news papers people talk about everyone on Twitter is talking about this, this is all happening on Twitter right now. So along with this great work we do in servicing our syndicated audience across the entirety of the web and our TV and news partners they bring all of this attention to the state as users come to Twitter looking for the content they’ve been told is happening and unfolding on Twitter right now and many of them brows around some of them search, some of them look at profiles and obviously from the numbers we’re seeing most of them decide not to log in.
So we’re serving this huge syndicated audience we have that growing we’re serving that 271 million monthly active users who do log in well and that’s growing and we feel like we provide limited content to those hundreds of millions of other users who are unique visitors to our proprieties and we see an opportunity, a bit opportunity to serve them just as well as these other two audiences. So that’s how I would frame what you’re seeing in that first group of users there.
Your second question, MoPub, we continue to see just that our big best on programmatic buying, mobile buying and the accelerated investment in mobile advertising all map so directly to for the kind of work we’re doing in MoPub and continue to believe that’s just a significant opportunity for us. I will kick it over to Anthony to comment on the future opportunities there.
Anthony Noto
Sure, no problem I would say I would characterize that we are seeing very strong growth of 170 billion ad impressions in the last 30 days request that were fulfilled out from $130 billion in April, so very strong growth there. From a bigger picture perspective, I’ve mentioned the closing of the acquisition of TapCommerce that’s a DSP that we will tie into MoPub which is a mobile exchange. And essentially it allow us to take the demand that we’re seeing both into Twitter and across the web and aggregated across not only Twitter inventory, but network inventory through the exchange that MoPub can help facilitate on this supply side and tap commerce is a nice addition adding additional demand on top of the exchange.

Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets

Two questions please. In a note about the metrics there is that reference to the 14% of users that making result from automated activity. Can you give us any context around that was it smaller number in the past or a higher number? And then Dick over the last three quarters you’ve talked about it seems like an intense, greater focus on the user expense. So just at a high level, where do you think you are in terms of getting Twitter to the optimal user experience and I am sure there is no optimal but as you -- how much of this is serendipities how much of this is a product plan, product pipeline that you’ve led out over the last three quarters over the last year. How much better can user experience should it get and can it get is the basic question? Thank you.
Dick Costolo

So I will take that second question first and then would go up from there. So thanks Mark, vis-à-vis the greater focus on user experience how much better can it get, to be perfectly frank we think it can be a lot better. We have I think a lot of great thinking on the teams about how we can make it better, surfacing that kinds of great conversation, the pop up in timelines from time to time making sure that for those users we follow hundreds of accounts, they don’t miss the very, very best pieces of those, streams as they flow by and then once again for those users who are new to the platform and are coming to the platforms for the first time getting them value immediately. So I think it’s a case that we believe that across the spectrum of our users, even our core users who are on the product every day, we can deliver much better experience to them and I think the answer to how much better is significantly.
Mike Gupta 

Yes, Mark this is Mike. To your first question and I believe the number we disclosed in a fellow slide below the 14% I think closer to 11 but this refers to I think it was 12% actually, it refers to automated poling requests we get from third-party apps and that switches frankly back and forth depending on the application. So I think of that as the high end and we think we are within that. But again these are users who are getting pooled Twitter content and then in any cases they are viewing that content coming in an automated way.

Brian Wieser - Pivotal Research

So while we know the U.S. and the UK are important, I was wondering if you might be able to rank order the next several markets perhaps for revenue or perhaps get some identify which countries contributed disproportionately to growth? And then one separate question just following up on earlier comment you made, 40% of users live in countries where self-service advertising is available. I was wondering how much of your actual ad revenue is self service? Thank you.
Dick Costolo
In terms of the other countries, in terms of the year-over-year growth rate in absolute dollars, the U.S., the UK and Japan contributed the most in year-over-year absolute dollars to give a perspective on that from a geographic standpoint. In terms of percentage of a revenue that’s coming through self-service, that’s not a metric that we’ve shared and we are not prepared to share at this time. We are encouraged by the impact that self-serve has on the SMB advertiser base and I think it’s a big opportunity for us obviously if it’s only covering 40% of our user base or less than 40% of user base at this point, there is a lot of opportunity ahead of us but at this point the percentage of revenue is not disclosed.
Brian Wieser - Pivotal Research

I should actually clarify, is the self-service advertising primarily being used by the small businesses or do you see opportunity still for the self-service advertising on the core platform from the bigger brands?

Thanks.
Dick Costolo

Ben, could you repeat the first part of your question, you broke up as you’re saying.
Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital

So just like Facebook is focusing on getting more content from public entity such as celebrities, is Twitter going to work to get exclusive content from such entity or do you think [indiscernible]. 
Dick Costolo

Hey Ben, you broke up again, but fortunately you broke up on a different part this time so I think we got just a bit I would say that we love the relationships we have with both those kinds of public figures in all walks of life and the content producers and broadcasters who work with them and the kinds of content that they deliver into Twitter and more confident and love the way that we’re growing both those kinds of relationship I think that will just continue to be a strength for us. And then I think your second question was future guidance and Anthony?
Anthony Noto

Thanks Ben. I was fortunate as banker start working with Twitter under the coverage for the speak over a year ago and really getting a good understanding of metrics and the business and I can tell you in that more than one year that this change meaningfully in a number of different regards giving all the initiatives the company has rolled out and successful in the TV. That’s a long way we’re saying we’ll continuously evaluate what are the best metrics to disclose that best represent the drivers of our business as it relates to building shareholder value. And so as we go into the 2015 planning process we will do a deep dive in all the key metrics and we entirely represent the company to the public investor and make the appropriate changes we find in that time was the very beginning of that there is nothing I will talk about today but it’s a process every year getting how fast to comes innovating and how quickly the business is changing.

Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein

Thank you. Two quick questions if I may, do you guys believe you can build an accurate reliable graph for visitors and if yes, how? And if not, is it reasonable to assume that the monetization potential for visitors will be significantly lower than the potential for your logged on users. And secondly what are that would causes for the difference in timeline views between domestic and international users and how you can do a both? Thank you.
Dick Costolo

Hi Carlos this is Dick I will take the first question there. The interesting thing about the different audiences again when you think them in sort of three groups those 271 million monthly active users for whom we have a great interest graph, that audience that we see indication and then thirdly those hundreds of millions of visitors who come to Twitter there is frequently tremendous signal from those visitors who come to Twitter, they may have come directly from specific search intent and then today already when we look at the kinds of profile that many of them view and navigate between you get some great signal for the kinds of content they’ve come to Twitter to consume and we think that long term those kinds of singles will provide us with the data that we need to deliver the right kinds of monetization experiences to that audience. Again I would make very, very clear that we will focus initially and for some time on user experience and make sure we get that right before we go down their path.
Anthony Noto
I’ll talk about the difference between timeline use per MAU U.S. MAU versus the international MAU and the difference in magnitude, point there is the U.S. market obviously more mature as it relates to MAU use one concentrated geography while the international number represents many disperse geographies and in each one of those geographies the amount of content that has been twitted or can be engage with is going to be different in the level of quality and breadth and depth that we have in the United States.
And as that breadth, depth and quality improves our content then the consumption measuring timeline use for MAU also change. The other thing I say about the international market is they’re all very different than U.S. the devices they use to access Twitter are very different they talk earlier about some of the issues we have in developing markets and because of that different device the experience is different and doesn’t lend itself to use much consumption, but as devices become more technologically advance with greater penetration we’ll see those two start to converge more.
Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein 
Thank you.
Dick Costolo

Great, thank you. And the next question comes from the Twitter account of Victor Anthony, Capital Market and he says, -- that you can potentially close the monetization gap with the industry overtime, how do you see your business model changing in order to narrow that gap and what level of investment with that require those organically. And so the way I’d answer the question is taking a step a back and thinking about the big drivers of monetization. The first obviously the level of monetization is what’s our ad load. And we are at a very, very low level of advertising load or coverage and we have the significant opportunity to increase that especially relative to our public peers but also just generally. The second driver of our monetization is click-through rate and that’s a function of improving the prediction of the individual users attractive us to that advertising or targetability and also formats to more formats that we can provide advertisers for the specific objective they want to accomplish. From a market perspective, the better the put through rates can be, the more appropriate that pay for performance engagement metric can be to their objective.
And then the last point I’d mention is price. And as we continue to drive scale which advertisers are looking for in a specific target, we continue to have new products, that are more targetable and more appropriate for the specific marketing objective, ROI will go up. And as ROI goes up, advertiser demand will increase and that will continue to drive price. So it’s a very wide open opportunity for given where we are in the add load side of the equation and relative to the number of advertisers in the formats that we have.
So we think there is a big opportunity to not just reach where industry peers are but potentially to exceed it. In terms of the investment, we don’t see a step wise change in our investment in order to get there we’re just doing more of what we are doing. Building a big audience, giving in the right ad, products that they want, the right data and measurability and targeting and ultimately it will continue to drive the growth that we expect.

Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee

A couple of actually, first one is I wonder if you could maybe speak to some of the user trends post the World Cup? And then also in light of how might have been exceeding your guidance for EBITDA margins et cetera. Wondering if that has changed your thinking on the long-term margin potential, which you’ve led out at 35% to 40% in the past. So wondering if that’s starting to change in your mind at all? Thank you.
Dick Costolo

So, on the user trends we don’t update the specific monthly user trends. There is an implication in our guidance that could tie back to users we gave you, revenue guidance obviously for the third quarter. We also provided a perspective on the expected trend in revenue per time line view as well as in time line view per MAU and the combination of those three things as well as considerations for seasonality overtime can help you triangulate into MAU number. Bit we remain very optimistic about the product changes that we have and we are just balancing the opportunities versus risks in our guidance to give you a perspective on that specific question. Your second question is long-term margins and the answer to that is no. During the IPO road show to company talked about 35% to 40% long-term adjusted EBITDA margins and that still remains the case for that.

If you go back to Mark’s question earlier on the disclosure on the 14% end users that are being impacted by the application, what would MAU’s have looked like kind of year-on-year or sequentially if we excluded any user that didn’t have any active -- any action involved within and you’ve excluded those guys from the user base? And then secondly, any help on kind of rough-sizing for duplicative accounts. So if I have three accounts, one for Michigan Football, one for politics and one for finance, what -- any idea for kind of duplicative accounts in the MAU number? Thanks.
Mike Gupta

Hey, Brian it is Mike. Yes, just on the 14% and as I mentioned it is up slightly from 12 we saw in Q1. This is I would say is a maximum number so we have many applications that are pulling into Twitter for Twitter content. This is predetermined timelines and twits that users are looking for. So we don’t have a very reliable way to know exactly how many of that -- how much of that pool of activity is actually user seeing that content. So we wanted to be conservative here and share kind of the outer bound but, historically we’ve seen that content is in fact being driven and those actually active users. But we don’t have an actual number that we can share. On duplicative accounts, there is some usage of multiple accounts by single users but again that’s not a number of that we just…

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Twitter First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Krista Bessinger.
Krista Bessinger
Great. Thanks, Jenny, and good afternoon. Welcome to our Q2 (sic) [Q1] Earnings Call, and thanks for joining us. We have with us today our CEO, Dick Costolo; and our CFO, Mike Gupta. We'll be starting with approximately 15 minutes of prepared remarks followed by 45 minutes of Q&A. During the Q&A, we will take questions asked via Twitter in addition to questions from conference call participants. Questions submitted via Twitter should be directed to @TwitterIR using the hashtag #TWTRearnings.
We'd like remind everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call, such as our outlook for Q2 and 2014 and our operational plans and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Please take a look at our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the factors that could cause our results to differ materially. The forward-looking statements on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in our earnings press release. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. Also, an audio replay of this call will be available via Twitter and on the website in a few hours.
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Dick Costolo.
Richard Costolo
Thanks, Krista, and thanks, everybody. I'll kick it off here with a few opening remarks, then Mike will walk through the numbers in detail and we'll come back for questions.
We had a great first quarter. Revenue growth accelerated year-over-year by 119% to $250 million, fueled by 2 things: increased engagement and user growth. Seeing revenue acceleration in Q1 is particularly gratifying coming off our strong fourth quarter revenue numbers.
Last quarter I spoke about a number of initiatives we have underway to drive user growth and engagement, and I like the progress we've made there. Monthly active users grew to 255 million in the quarter, including re-acceleration in our largest market, the U.S., which added 3 million net new users. We had great engagement increases as well, and Mike will talk about those.
We're continuing to execute on the product road map I laid out for you on the last call. I love the work we've done, making the platform more visually engaging, for example. And you'll start to see more in the areas of organizing content for new users and innovating on direct messages, to name 2 other areas.
I want to speak a bit about the broader Twitter platform that's unfolding, specifically our ad exchange and the impact of Twitter across the entirety of the web and mobile landscape. Content creators, publishers and marketers care about 2 things: scale and engagement, and our platform increasingly delivers both of those.
First, I'm proud of the speed with which the teams here integrated MoPub, our mobile ad exchange into Twitter. It now reaches over 1 billion iOS and Android users, making it one of, if not, the largest in-app mobile ad exchange and the only one at scale to offer publishers native in-app advertising. Our recently announced mobile app download suite is the first product to take advantage of this integration, but there's a lot more to come.
In Q2, we will offer even greater reach and scale to advertisers with the launch of an integrated bidding system, which will allow them to bid across this combined inventory through a single interface for many kinds of ads. To be very clear, there are few other companies with this kind of reach, and we see a strategic opportunity here to assist marketers in making a shift from desktop to mobile.
Second, I want to quickly highlight the reach and impact of Twitter across the entirety of the web and mobile landscape, as this will be an important area for us as we scale. In the 2 days after the Oscars, there were over 3.3 billion views of tweets just about the show. That kind of reach and impact is why we now have TV measurement and ratings partnerships in 11 countries, and it's what's enabled us to build a partnership with Billboard for the first real-time chart to highlight the music of the moment.
We're going to continue to invest in scaling our syndication capabilities to include new ways to distribute our content. As we do, there's significant opportunity for us in leveraging the widely distributed characteristic of public tweets.
These 2 pieces, our ad exchange and the reach and impact off of Twitter, are just parts of a larger platform strategy, and you should expect to see us offer even more tools to help content creators, publishers and advertisers make the most of the real-time data that only come through Twitter, the richness of our interest graph and our incredible mobile scale.
To wrap up, I'm happy with the company's focus, the remarkable quality of people we're attracting into the company and the positive reaction I hear from customers and partners that I visit around the world. We have an obligation to all our users to be the best companion experience to what's happening in their world, and I've never seen the team more fired up about the opportunity in front of us.
And with that, here's Mike to walk you through the numbers.
Mike Gupta
Thanks, Dick, and good afternoon, everyone. I will walk you through our financial and operating performance for Q1, and then touch briefly on guidance before opening the call for your questions.
At a high level, we are very pleased with our Q1 results. It was a strong quarter despite the challenge of seasonality, and both total revenue growth and ad revenue growth continued to accelerate on a year-over-year basis. Total revenue reached $250 million, up 119% from the year-ago period and up 3% sequentially. Ad revenue reached $226 million, up 125% from last year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter.
A number of factors contributed to our strong performance, including a full quarter of media forward, our rich media experience; continued improvements in our prediction and targeting capabilities; and strong demand from advertisers, especially around live events in the U.S.
We continue to see very strong growth in ad engagements, up almost 700% year-over-year and up 28% quarter-over-quarter. We saw strong advertiser demand around live events in Q1, including the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the Oscars and the Grammys. And we saw strong adoption of our TV product set, which includes Amplify, keyword targeting and TV conversation targeting. Advertisers are using these tools to achieve the share of voice they're looking for, and we're seeing them increase their mobile budgets around live events.
As a percentage of revenue, mobile performed well in the quarter, with approximately 80% of total ad revenue generated from mobile devices, up from approximately 60% in the prior year.
In Q1, international revenue accounted for 28% of total revenue, up 183% year-over-year. We continue to expand internationally with both our direct sales effort and our self-serve product. And as a result, we expect to see continued strong international growth in the future.
Data licensing and other revenue contributed $24 million in the quarter, an increase of 76% year-over-year. This reflects an increase of 6% quarter-over-quarter, which was driven by better-than-expected performance from our mobile ad exchange.
Turning now to expenses. I want to remind you that unless otherwise noted, my comments will focus on our non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and income tax effects related to acquisitions. For the GAAP financial measures, as well as a reconciliation between the non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release posted on our IR website.
In Q1, total expenses were $247 million, up 104% year-over-year and up 10% from the previous quarter. The increase was driven primarily by headcount and related overhead costs, as we continue to invest in our workforce to scale our business and drive continued product innovation. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,000 employees.
Operating expense by line item was as follows: Cost of sales for the first quarter was $71 million, R&D costs were $71 million, sales and marketing costs were $77 million and general and administrative costs were $28 million. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of $37 million compared to $12 million in the prior year period, representing an EBITDA margin of 15% in Q1.
Non-GAAP net income was $183,000 in the first quarter, up from a non-GAAP net loss of approximately $11 million in the same period a year ago. Our GAAP net loss in the first quarter was $132 million, which includes $126 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Before I turn to metrics, let me cover a few items related to cash and CapEx. We ended the quarter with roughly $2.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our CapEx was $67 million, $17 million of which was financed through capital leases. The remaining $50 million was purchased outright. Our total CapEx in Q1 reflects continued investment in co-located data centers and office facilities.
Now I'd like to turn to our operating metrics. As Dick mentioned, we are seeing early signs that the product enhancements we are making are driving increased growth in monthly active users, timeline views and interactions per timeline view. These metrics also benefited from new device activations and a significant number of live events in Q1.
First, on user growth. We saw good growth in monthly active users in the first quarter. Average MAUs reached 255 million, reflecting 14 million net additions in the first quarter, up from 9 million net additions in Q4. We saw strong growth in both U.S. and international markets.
U.S. MAUs reached 57 million, reflecting 3 million net additions in the first quarter, up from 1 million net additions in the fourth quarter. And international MAUs reached 198 million, reflecting 11 million net additions, up from 8 million net additions in Q4.
Timeline views increased to approximately 157 billion, up 20 billion or 15% from the same quarter last year and up 9 billion or 6% from the fourth quarter. Timeline views per MAU were stable quarter-over-quarter, suggesting that on average, new users added in the quarter are just as engaged as existing users. Interactions per timeline view were also up significantly, with favorites and retweets up 26% in Q1, highlighting that users are driving greater value from the timelines that they are consuming.
Moving down to monetization. Ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views reached $1.44 in Q1, up 96% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially, due to typical Q1 seasonality, which is more pronounced here in the U.S. U.S. ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views reached $3.47, up 78% year-over-year and international ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views reached $0.61, up 152% year-over-year.
Now let me turn to ad engagements, cost per ad engagement and ad load. As a reminder, we do not optimize for cost per ad engagement. Instead, we optimize for user experience, advertiser ROI and overall yield on the platform.
In Q1, average cost per ad engagement was down 20% quarter-over-quarter. This was more than offset by the 28% increase in total ad engagements, thereby driving overall ad revenue up while improving the quality of our user experience and increasing advertiser ROI. The increase in ad engagements was driven by higher quality ads and the increased use of reach media by our advertisers. Importantly, we are able to achieve these results, while maintaining very low ad load.
Before I turn to guidance, let me touch quickly on our decision not to pursue a secondary offering. One of the primary reasons companies typically pursue a secondary offering is to provide organized liquidity to early investors who are looking to sell stock. As you may have seen in our recent 8-K and in statements made to the press, many of our largest insiders and early investors have indicated that they have a long-term belief in the company and are taking a long-term view of the stock. As such, they do not currently have any plans to sell stock immediately upon lock-up expiration. And as a result, we have no plans to pursue a secondary offering at this time.
Now let's turn to the outlook. While Q1 was a strong quarter for us, we believe part of it was driven by the live events that I mentioned earlier. And while there will be key events in Q2 like the World Cup, there will be fewer than in Q1. Despite this, we expect total revenue to grow to $270 million to $280 million, with adjusted EBITDA in the range of $25 million to $30 million. Note that expenses in Q2 will be higher, primarily due to recent acquisitions, as well as the continued investment in our core business. And finally, we expect stock-based compensation expense in the range of $170 million to $180 million.
For full year 2014, we are raising our range for total revenue to between $1.2 billion and $1.25 billion, $50 million above our previous range. The increase reflects our Q1 outperformance, increased expectations for our advertising business and the inclusion of Gnip, which will be reported in the data licensing and underlying going forward. While we won't be breaking out Gnip's results explicitly, it's worth noting that we have an existing commercial relationship in which we received a significant revenue share from the company. The Gnip revenue added to our outlook reflects only the incremental revenue that we do not already recognize.
Moving on to profits, stock-based compensation and CapEx. We are raising our range for adjusted EBITDA to between $180 million and $205 million; stock-based compensation expense to be in the range of $640 million to $690 million, which is $40 million above the previous range due to recent acquisitions; and CapEx between $330 million and $390 million.
In summary, we are very pleased with this quarter. We saw increased revenue, driven by the accelerated growth of our user base and their increased level of engagement. We will continue to invest in growing our user base and enhancing our monetization capabilities. But we remain disciplined, and we will invest wisely to deliver continued long-term growth for our shareholders.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Just I got 2 basic questions. You had mentioned that you saw some sequential improvement in user metrics, like MAU adds and engagement. I guess, I'm trying to understand if some of the product changes that you've made in the last 6 months are gaining momentum. Did you see that the user metrics were improving as you exited the quarter versus maybe the beginning of the quarter? And then the second question is favorites and retweets continue to increase, but TLV over MAU, this metric continues to drop off a bit. So I guess, sequentially, it looks okay. But when do you start to comp through some of the product-related changes that are impacting that metric? And I guess, a better way to ask that is could you just give us a sense of what the average number of sessions per MAU looks like today versus maybe a year ago for the typical Twitter user?
Richard Costolo
Ross, it's Dick. A couple of questions there. I'll start with the first one around user growth. I'd say that there was no specific one thing in the first quarter, one specific kind of change we made that was responsible for the majority of the growth. It was a combination of some of our improvements and our recommendations -- recommending accounts for you to follow based on our algorithms; two, the more global rollout of our native mobile sign-up process; and then three, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the process of making Twitter more visually engaging. And I think that -- and how we would frame that vis-à-vis looking forward, is as follows: We still firmly believe that it will be the combination of changes that we make over the course of the year on that road map we've laid out for you that will result in a change in the growth of the platform. And we're confident in that change based on the results we've seen from these first few changes that we've made that we've talked about in the previous quarter. Vis-à-vis your second point about engagement, there are several things we look at there. Let me just talk about each of those -- a couple -- each of those few things and then tie it all together for you as regard to your specific question about timeline views per MAU. So first of all, there's timeline views. And as Mike mentioned in his remarks, the thing we love about timeline views in the first quarter was that they're stable vis-à-vis MAUs for all of the net new users that we added. So that means that on average, our net new users are just as engaged as our existing users, which is great. Now compound that with the multiplicative effect, multiplicative impact of engagement per timeline view, which we've really been focused on the last couple of quarters. We talked about that in the Q4 call and Mike mentioned it again today, that favorites and retweets are up 26%. So you've got this multiplicative impact of engagement per timeline and timeline views per MAU. And that engagement per timeline that we're driving flows all the way through to monetization, as you saw reflected in our results. So now to that specific question about down 8% year-over-year, we made a number of changes in the second half of the year last year that were focused on increasing the value of an individual timeline view. For example, conversations. Used to be the case that when you came to Twitter and you wanted to follow a conversation, you kind of had to hop around back and forth between timelines, and that would drive up timeline views. Well, in order to increase the value of user experience, what we did in the second half of last year, along with a number of things -- along with a number of other things, is to collapse that conversation into a single timeline view to drive additional value to the user in each timeline view. So it will be the case through the first half of the year that you will continue to see what happened in the second half of the year when we work on those kinds of collapsing the value into a single timeline view.
Operator
The next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Diana R. Kluger - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
This is Diana on for Doug. First question, which is kind of related to the prior question on timeline views, and maybe if you could prioritize to us which metrics you're looking in order of importance.
Richard Costolo
Sure. It's -- again because we look at these things in aggregate -- I'm glad you asked me that. Thanks, Diana. Because it's not a binary either-or here. If you think about over the course of the long term, we're going to drive up engagement, we believe, over all of these axes. But the current focus on increasing the value of a single timeline has this multiplicative effect, as we've seen, on monetization. And I think that's a way we think about it. We don't think about it as a binary either-or. It's the combination of the 2. When you add to that, the sort of concentric circle of engagement across the broader Twitter platform, you get what, again, what I think is a combinatorial effect of the engagement on platform and the broader billions of users who are consuming tweets off the platform.
Diana R. Kluger - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
And if you could just quickly clarify the comment on the guidance going forward, how part of it is including only the incremental that isn't already being recognized.
Mike Gupta
Yes. Diana, that's related to the Gnip acquisition. So we have yet to close that. But we currently have a commercial relationship with them, where we receive a meaningful rev share from the company. Upon the acquisition closing, we will then recognize the incremental revenue that we don't recognize today. Just so people understand that it's -- the full 100% of Gnip revenue is not incremental to our financials today.
Operator
The next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura.
Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
I have one for Dick, and it just has to do with how the use case for Twitter is evolving over time. I use Twitter as sort of a news feed of sort in terms of headlines and things from media outlets. But of course, there's so many people out there that use it for conversation in groups. And with over-the-top messaging platforms out there and trying to get involved in this space, I just wonder what you're doing in response to sort of the piece of the Twitter use case that overlaps with over-the-top messaging.
Richard Costolo
Sure. We think of Twitter as this companion experience to what's happening in your world. One of the reasons when you talk to people, you hear ""I use it for this; well, I use it for that"" is because it's this companion experience to what's happening in your world. And I really see that as the consistent use case over time. And as you think about the broader question when will -- in the context of when will Twitter be mainstream, the beauty of Twitter as a platform today is that -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had 3.3 billion views of tweets just about the Oscars in the 48 hours after the Oscars. Now that's a big number. If you think about that in the context of something like YouTube, where you've got YouTube content networks with thousands of channels, some of the biggest of which that will achieve over 3 billion views a month -- I think we'd all consider YouTube a mainstream platform, and we saw that around the Oscars in just 2 days. So Twitter as a platform, we believe, is already incredibly mainstream. And now what we need to do is help that world of users who already experience Twitter every day understand the value, the increased value of the log-in experience.
Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
And if I may, just one quick one for Mike. You mentioned the Olympics as a live event that was a driver of behavior in the quarter. I just wondered if can you talk about other idiosyncratic events like the plane that went down in Malaysia or the events in Ukraine, and how those compared to something like the Olympics in terms of being a driver of the KPIs that you're looking at.
Mike Gupta
Yes. So thanks, Anthony, for the question. When we look at events like that, I think they differ a little bit. The -- some of the key events I talked about in Q1, things like the Super Bowl, the Oscars and the Grammys, those not only attract user attention on the platform, but they also attract advertiser attention. I think some of these other events like the Ukraine or the plane crash of the Malaysian Airlines, those, again, attract meaningful amounts of conversation on the platform and usage from our users, but they're not necessarily, I think, that would attract the advertisers to the platform to advertise specifically around those events. So that's the one distinction I would make.
Operator
The next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.
Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Dick, is there any sense that you can give us in terms of the kind of user growth cadence you saw over the course of the quarter, particularly relative to the U.S. where you saw that sequential acceleration, and particularly to the extent that you can talk about sort of the cadence month-to-month for the quarter and maybe even into April? And then also, are there any specific products enhancements that you've seen have an impact on user growth in the U.S. that you've yet to roll out internationally that we should be thinking about, that would suggest incremental international growth when they are rolled out?
Richard Costolo
Sure. Heath, this is Dick. I think there wasn't any specific within January, February, March months that was any stronger than any other nor was there any specific product rollout or moment I would point to that resulted in growth. So as you think about things like Moments! or from HERE on, I don't think there's anything like that to look at or to see in the numbers. Vis-à-vis your question, product changes that will be rolled out internationally that will boost growth, I think we already saw some of that in the first quarter when we took our native mobile sign-up and rolled that out internationally. We had initially kicked it off in Q4, and it came out more broadly in Q1. So I think that, that's the way I would think about it. Going forward, again, looking beyond where we are today, I don't think of a specific feature or moment or once these 3 these things are in the product, x will happen. It will be this combination of changes.
Krista Bessinger
Thanks. And we'll take our next question from Twitter, which comes from the Twitter account of Neil Doshi @CRT. And Neil asks, ""Are there any ad verticals that showed strength and/or weakness specifically during the quarter?""
Mike Gupta
Great. I'll take that. This is Mike. Thanks for that question, Neil. We generally saw a strong quarter across all of our verticals. I think if I had to point out one that showed some weakness, it would be retail, which is very much as expected as we moved out of the Q4 holiday season into Q1. But we -- in particular, we saw strength around the consumer packaged goods and the media and entertainment verticals.
Neil, I'm just looking at the screen. I noticed you have another -- 2 more questions, and maybe I'll just hit those really quickly.
The next one from Neil is, ""How are self-serve ads tracking in the U.S. as well as the international rollout of self-serve?""
So Neil, let me speak a little bit more generally about self-serve in the context of our SMB. That continues to do well for us. We talked last quarter about international expansion and launching the self-serve platform in the U.K., Ireland and Canada. The results from there have been very positive. You may have seen late last week, we announced our relationship with Yahoo! Japan, where they're now selling our inventory into their SMB channel. So we're very excited about the potential there, given the size of that market. And we continue to execute and we do have plans to continue to roll out the platform globally over the remainder of the year. And generally speaking, to the ad platform, we continue to improve the targeting. We improve -- we're continuing to make it more intuitive, and that's being really well received by the SMBs.
And then Neil, I'll just hit quickly on your last question, which is about U.S. timeline. ""Ad RPM showed nice acceleration in Q1. Would we expect deceleration in the second half given the tough comps?""
So I think you're looking at the year-over-year acceleration, we went from 73% in Q4 to 78% in Q1 here in the U.S. And really, that's driven by -- we're seeing a full quarter of media forward, as we've talked about in our comments. That's really driven up engagement, not only from the user side but also translating through to ad engagement. And so we're seeing a full quarter impact of that. And then there was a number of improvements and additions into the targeting capability that we made throughout the course of last year, things like TV conversation targeting, several things within the TV product suite, like TV conversation targeting and others, which are really driving that increased engagement. And then lastly, over the course of the year, we think continuing to add advertisers to the platform. The addition of these advertisers gives us more relevant content to show our users, and we're seeing that translate into higher quality ads; and as a result, higher engagement. Thanks.
Krista Bessinger
Great, thank you. Operator, we'll take the next question, please, from phone line.
Operator
The next question comes from Jordan Monahan from Morgan Stanley.
Jordan Monahan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Actually, 2, if we can. I think higher level, maybe for Dick. The first one is when you think about communication services and short messaging services globally, it seems like there are a number of global competitors. And we're wondering, do you think that over time that users tend to congregate around a single global service? Or do you think there are regional differences that would actually prevent that from happening and natives kind of short messaging and communications just inherently more local and more regional? And then the second question is just around MoPub and your mobile advertising efforts. We're just wondering, from the advertiser perspective, we would assume that having a single point of contact is fairly useful and important, but we wanted to get your thoughts on that. And then from a user perspective, does having MoPub help you reengage existing Twitter users? And are you able to somehow pull them back into the platform?
Richard Costolo
Sure. There are few questions there. On the first one, regarding messaging services specifically, from which I would -- short messaging services specifically, in fact, I think you're referring to some of the private messaging services. I think on the private messaging services, there's certainly -- we see -- you see a regional differentiation there, things like KakaoTalk and Line and so forth. I think that platforms like Twitter don't see that kind of regional differentiation. And in fact, we see a broad global distribution of our users. So that's to your first point, specifically. I think that on your MoPub question, when you asked, ""Is a single point of contact powerful for advertisers?"" Absolutely. And let me maybe set a little bit of context for that. Marketers are looking for 2 things, right? They're looking for scale and engagement. And when you think about the scale of already having thousands of in-app publishers deploying MoPub that deliver over 1 billion iOS and Android users, you've got scale there. And then when we bring our native ad unit that delivers these industry-leading engagement rates, that combination of scale and engagement, we already have in market. I think it's hugely valuable for marketers. For publishers, when you think about our mobile ad exchange, the beauty of it being a platform and not just an ad network is that we can accept supply and demand from anywhere. And what publishers are looking for is an opportunity to optimize yield. So when they can plug in a platform like MoPub that can accept supply and demand from multiple sources, that's great for them.
Jordan Monahan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
And I guess, just on the user engagement. Is there some piece of MoPub that will actually allow you to help users once they've experienced an ad service through MoPub? Is there a way to help you bring them back to the Twitter platform and continue to engage on the platform?
Richard Costolo
Sure. Sorry, I missed your last -- I skipped over your last question there. So here's how I think about that. When I go back to my comments about Twitter the platform and those 3.3 billion views of tweets just about the Oscars, that's a tiny example of the ubiquity, the almost omnipresence we have in the world to be in front of users, any kind of user. And of course, again, that's just online reach. That doesn't include the tweets on air. During Adam Silver's press conference today, there were constantly tweets on air under -- on the screen, tweets in print, et cetera. So we feel like our almost ubiquitous presence in front of these people around the world is what will -- is what gives us an ongoing opportunity to reengage users.

The next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Two questions, please. Could you talk about the best or most interesting international white space opportunities, particularly markets or product rollouts you think are particularly interesting over the next year? And then just in terms of engagement, is there any way you could talk about engagement trends on a cohort basis and talk about how timeline views per user from a cohort or other measures of engagement have changed? Maybe that would help us work our way through some of the noise that comes from bringing in newer users.
Richard Costolo
Yes Mark, it's Dick. Let me take the first question there. I think that when you think about the -- I'll try to generalize this, but these things are hard to generalize. When you think about the best international opportunity, and this goes back to one of the previous questions about private messaging or short messaging, private short messaging services, there's a real opportunity for us when we think about our private messaging to strengthen the core of our Twitter product by making it easier for users to move more fluidly between the public conversation that happens everywhere on Twitter and the private conversation between you and a friend or you and a few friends. There are certainly places in the world where the private conversation is culturally looked upon as more valuable. And in those markets, we'll look to strengthen our core product by making it easier for those folks to move more fluidly between the public conversation and the private conversation within the product.
Mike Gupta
And let me take -- Mark, I'll take the engagement by cohort. I mean, if you look at what we just disclosed around timeline views, primarily you see that at a constant quarter-over-quarter. And I think that's indicative more broadly -- outside some of the product changes that we're going through year-over-year and that eventually will anniversary. I think it's indicative more broadly that when we look at cohorts, old cohorts versus new, there's different use cases within those. And so what we would say is on average, these new cohorts are just as engaged. And obviously, there are specific use cases that differ within them. But we generally view them as consistent in -- over time.
Richard Costolo
Yes. And to just hop in there, right, yes, it's a tag-team match. This is Dick again. I think one thing that's probably worth pointing out is that -- we mentioned this on our S-1, our DAU-MAU ratio, if you kind of think of it in terms of just the broadest engagement sense, our DAU-MAU ratio remains in the very high 40%.
Krista Bessinger
And our next question is going to come from our Twitter stream from the account of Rich Greenfield. And he asks, ""Please discuss how the new app install ads will impact ad revenue in Q2 and the rest of the year.""
Mike Gupta
Great. Thanks, Rich, for the question. I'll take that. So just to state the power of the app install ad, what we're seeing here like many of the recent Cards [ph] we've released is they're designed to drive a specific action tied to the advertiser objective, and we're seeing that result in great conversion and their willingness to pay. I think we view this as a big opportunity. We've seen and gotten great feedback from some of our early partners, like Spotify, Kabam and HotelTonight. Having said that, we think it's too early to quantify more broadly the opportunity, but it is factored into the outlook we've provided for both Q2 and the full year.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. And let's take our next question, please, from the phone line.

The next question comes from Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Dick, I want to go back to your comments, it might have been yours, Mike, too, about the quarter and then the contribution of the Olympics, Super Bowl, Grammys, certainly a lot of activity, big-profile events. Beyond contributing to tweet volume, do you have a sense of how they contributed to MAU growth, generally? And I was just trying to get a sense of do you expect some sort of unusual seasonality going forward by calling those out?
Richard Costolo
This is Dick. No, I think that I would categorize -- I would just categorize them as interesting. But it's really this collection of product changes that we made over the course of the quarter, combined with some of those things, driving some new people to the top of the funnel. But I wouldn't put too much emphasis on those.
Operator
The next question comes from Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.
A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I was hoping you could talk a little bit about where you are on ad loads. It seems like a lot more room there, and how you think about that. And then on a bigger picture basis, this -- which relates to that, you're doing about $1 per user per quarter, and which -- $4 per year. Where do you think you are on that scale? And as you look at some of the peers out there generating quite a bit more than that, just how do you think about that over the long term? And then one last thing on the financial side, SBC seems somewhat elevated this year. Is there any onetime things affecting this year that might not continue in future years?
Mike Gupta
Justin, thanks. It's Mike. If you look at -- as it relates to ad load, as I said in the prepared remarks, our ad load remains very low. And so we've had the luxury of being able to improve ad revenue per timeline view and monetization without impacting our ad load. Again, the focus for us is user experience. As we look at the $1 per user per quarter, we really think about it more from an ad revenue per timeline view perspective, and we feel like there's meaningful runway there. We've talked about some of the ad product improvements we've made. We've talked about the improvements we've made in the targeting algorithms and then also the improvements we're making on the consumer side that translates to, like media forward. All of these things are driving meaningfully higher engagement in the ad space, which is translating to higher ad revenue per timeline view. The 2 other things I'd mentioned that really can help drive that and propel that forward is as we bring more advertisers to the platform, we're bringing more relevant content and higher-quality ads and we're also seeing that translates to higher engagement. And then lastly, we continue to focus the efforts on expanding the sales force internationally, both self-serve and the direct sales force. So we think that will also narrow the gap internationally on monetization. So we think all of those really give us a runway. And then let me just hit SBC really quickly. We provided the outlook. I'd point to a couple of things. One, a $40 million stock-based comp increase driven by some of the recent acquisitions we've made. And I think just to keep in mind, and you'll see this in our 10-K, about $460 million of the outlook basically is related to grants that were made prior to -- at the end of 2013. And so over time, those will cascade off, but you can see that waterfall in our 10-K.
Krista Bessinger
And our next question comes from the Twitter stream from the account of @JudahE [ph] . And he asks, ""Do you care to respond to NBCUniversal's quote in the Financial Times regarding the emperor and his lack of clothes?""
Richard Costolo
So this is the Twitter and TV question, for those of you not familiar with the context. Yes, sure, I'll say this, our Twitter and TV strategy and our investment into that thesis was very much based on data that we saw, informing the 2-way complementary relationship between Twitter and TV. As that strategy has evolved and we've continued to invest in it, there is a host and a continuing emergence of independent third-party rigorous research that validates our belief in that investment thesis and strategy. FOX Research -- has produced research that shows 92% of Twitter users have taken immediately some action like either tuning into the TV show or searching for the TV show after seeing a tweet about the show. Symphony Advanced Media highlighted that use of Twitter while watching TV decreases an audience member's likelihood to change the channel. And then Nielsen found a causal relationship between Twitter activity and tune-in. Further, there were only 3 things that correlated with TV ratings in that study: prior seasons' ratings for the TV show, ad spend for the show and Twitter activity. So all of that tells us, in addition to, I would say, the growing number of content providers and broadcasters participating in our Amplify program, that our Twitter and TV strategy is on the right track.

The next question comes from Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research.
Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC
I was wondering, first, how many unique advertisers do you have at this point? And I was wondering if you could talk about the spending trend per advertiser and how you see that trending over time. A separate question, I was wondering if you could quantify approximately how much the Gnip transaction was worth and what that says about how your data strategy is going to look going forward.
Mike Gupta
Brian, it's Mike. Let me start. We -- as far as unique number of advertisers, that's not a statistic we share. That number is growing, and we feel good about the growth that we're seeing there. It's growing not only at the top of the funnel with the large branded advertisers, but also with the small to medium-sized businesses, as we continue to expand the self-serve platform internationally. On average, if we have to look at spend per advertiser, if I generalize a little bit, we are seeing that spend go up on a year-over-year basis. And that as we continue to bring more advertisers to the platform, we introduce better targeting capabilities, that spend goes up. As far as the price for Gnip, that's not something we're going to disclose at this time. And then lastly, let me just turn it over to Dick to just speak a little bit about the rationale behind the acquisition.
Richard Costolo
Brian, what we saw was marketers, specific industry verticals and then a bred of companies from the Fortune 500 companies, companies across all sorts of different industries increasingly leveraging Twitter data for business intelligence, customer relationship management, sentiment analysis. And then to marketers specifically, leveraging Twitter data to understand how to better target and delivered advertisements into our platform. So all of that helped us start to feel like that was something we needed to really bring in-house, because it's strategic to the future of the way we think about our data in service to those kinds of companies.

The next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
I guess, first one, on advertising costs going forward, what are you most excited about on the ad product side that could actually cause an inflationary pressure, sort of ad loads or user growth to drive this advertising growth going forward? That's question number one. Question number two, when you look at Q1, you've highlighted a number of special events or news events that may have reacted to engagement. Did you see advertisers changing their budget to either plan for those big events or react to big events in real-time that might sort of impact seasonality as we go forward in the advertising business longer term?
Mike Gupta
Eric, it's Mike. Let me start the second one first. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do see advertisers shift budget and focus budget around some of these live events. In particular in Q1 with these big events, we saw advertisers shift around the TV product suite that we offer that has Amplify and TV targeting, as well as -- TV conversation targeting as well as keyword targeting. And so we're seeing that happen. But what I would point out is that these events, while large, are not the vast majority. The vast majority of the revenue that we see in the quarter is not tied to these live events. And just to put a little bit of that in perspective, you mentioned the Super Bowl, there's 25 million tweets around the Super Bowl in that event. But we have over 1 million tweets about sports on the platform every day. If you look at the Grammys, we have 15 million tweets around the Grammys. There's approximately 3 million tweets about music on the platform every day. And so we are seeing advertisers participate in these conversations throughout the quarter and not just around the live events. As it relates to the first question, we target overall yield on the platform. We're not really looking at CP [ph] . And I think that some of the comments I mentioned earlier that we think can drive the ad revenue per timeline view, things like the better targeting, things like media forward, which improves engagement. And so really, what gets us excited is as we continue to iterate on the platform, we make the ad more engaging either through things like media forward or by bringing more relevant content to the -- from the advertisers -- by bringing more advertisers in platform. We think those things will drive overall yield on the platform.
Richard Costolo
I'd just add one thing to that, Eric. One of the neat things about the way marketers and advertisers around the world are starting to understand the fun ways to leverage the platform during those live events is how they're engaging in both the event and the conversation at the same time. Heineken had this hashtag #ShareTheSofa campaign during the European's Champion League games. And the user tweets to get fans watching at home the chance to have these conversations with soccer greats about the game that's happening, while it's happening. So I think that's kind of cool and highlights -- as advertisers increasingly learn how to think of Twitter as the second screen and connecting the conversation of what's going on right now. We see the sorts of engagement rates with those kinds of campaigns go up as well.
Krista Bessinger
Thank you. And the next question comes from our Twitter stream from the account of Dan Salmon @BMO. And he asks, ""How do you expect TV advertisers and agencies to leverage Twitter tools during the upfront, new front process?""
Mike Gupta
Great. Dan, it's Mike. I'll take that one. So as we're in the upfront process right now, we are partnering with a number of broadcasters and agencies during their upfront meetings. And we think there are number of tools that both advertisers and agencies can leverage both on the data side and the product side. Let me just start maybe a little on the data side, which is while marketers continue to purchase audience based on demographics and reach, what we're seeing is more and more, they're evaluating programs and content across the social dimension as well. And we -- as a result, we expect a lot of these networks and agencies to incorporate Twitter TV data into how they approach upfront and in particular leveraging the Nielsen Twitter TV rating as a complement to the other Nielsen ratings that are out there. And then on the product side, I talked a little bit about the TV product suite, which includes TV conversation targeting and Amplify. And we're seeing great momentum in Amplify. We have all of the major broadcasters here in the U.S. on the platform. We continue to sign deals internationally to bring that content to the Amplify program. And I think importantly, Amplify now has been in the market for a while, and advertisers are truly recognizing that Twitter complements and extends their ad spend on TV. It really increases the effectiveness of the TV advertising. Then just one example of that comes to mind is Verizon Wireless. They use Twitter in concert with TV advertising that they were doing around adding gross subscribers, and they saw a very meaningful lift in subscriber additions. And importantly, they've actually found Twitter to be as effective as search and direct response in that context.
Krista Bessinger
And we're going to take one more question from the Twitter stream. It comes from the account of Colin Sebastian @rwbaird. And he asks, ""Despite solid Q1 financials, there still seems to be a disconnect with usage metrics. When will these recalibrate?""
Richard Costolo
Yes. Colin, it's Dick. Let me be really clear. I'm really happy with engagement in Q1. It's fantastic across a number of dimensions: One, the areas of focus for us in the last couple of quarters have been increasing the value of a timeline. And we saw, again, as we've mentioned, 26% increase in retweets and favorites just in this last quarter on top of really great growth in Q4. And then additionally, we saw that our net new users in the quarter in terms of timeline views per MAU are just as engaged as our existing users. Because I think of these 2 factors as not an either-or but rather a multiplicative effect and then we see that impact flow through to monetization, and we all see what the results were there, I think that the engagement rates we're seeing are fantastic.

The next question comes from Jordan Rohan from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Jordan E. Rohan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
I haven't been following too much the commentary that the executive mayor [ph] at Twitter may have made about the secondary and selling and such. But I wanted to clarify. If there is no secondary, which I fully commend you making that decision because of the debate that continues over engagement metrics, are the investors who have invested privately and the employees, are they precluded from selling? Or would all of those -- all of that selling pressure have to fight itself to the open market?
Mike Gupta
Jordan, it's Mike. Employees and these early investors are not precluded from selling upon lock-up expiration. What I was referring to is the public statements made by many of our early investors, our large early investors, as well as some of our key insiders here, around the fact that they don't intend to sell immediately upon lock-up expiration.
Jordan E. Rohan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. Have you totaled the percentage of -- or the total number of shares that would be represented by those statements? Can you give us some idea for the amount of supply that will not hit the market because of those statements?
Mike Gupta
Yes, I would say it's a meaningful portion of the supply that could, in theory, come to market after a lock-up expiration. You can look at the 8-K and the recent proxy we filed, and you'd see how much those investors are holding, just to give you an aggregate sense. But I would say it's meaningful.

The next question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie.
Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research
Is one of your focus areas to drive growth in your own app downloads driving Twitter apps? And if so, what are some of the best ways you're seeing to do that? And also are there any notable differences between Android and Apple downloads? And then separately, should we expect you to build any meaningful independent stand-alone apps? Or will the focus continue to be on the Twitter app?
Richard Costolo
Sure. Ben, it's Dick. Two questions there. First question, yes, absolutely focused on driving Twitter app downloads, no question about it. But we don't particularly think there's anything -- any meaningful difference on any sort of percentage basis to point to on iOS versus Android. To your second question, we're very focused on strengthening our core products, Twitter and Vine. We're very focused on that. That's our plan today. We've talked about our roadmap for that for Twitter, and that's our plan going forward here in the near term.

The next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.
Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division
Just as a follow-up to the last question, when do you take the app -- install apps out of the beta, and when does it go live? And then can you maybe just help us gauge the MoPub opportunity? Just how big an opportunity you think it is this year, what's baked into your 2014 outlook?
Mike Gupta
Yes. Youssef, this is Mike. So on the first one, we don't have a specific date to announced on app download at this time. Having said that, as is typical, we want to be thoughtful about how we approach it. We are incorporating both user and advertiser feedback as we look to a GA [ph] type of rollout. Having said that, I just want to point out again, we are seeing great results from the early partners like Spotify, Kabam and HotelTonight. When we look at the MoPub opportunity, we do think it's a meaningful opportunity. Dick talked about the scale and the engagement. We talked about the 1 billion users across iOS and Android. MoPub does 130 billion ad requests a month. They're one of the largest in-app exchanges out there. So we think there's meaningful -- meaningful opportunity around MoPub. That is in our guidance, in the outlook we provided, both for Q2 and the full year, and we feel like we're very well positioned to go against the opportunity.

The final question comes from John Blackledge from Cowen and Company.
John R. Blackledge - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
Just a couple of questions. Are there -- back on the ad loads, are the lower ad loads a function of advertiser demand? Or is it a focus by Twitter on a good user experience or some other factor? And if you could just give us a sense of advertisers' view of ROI on Twitter versus maybe some other platforms that they're using.
Mike Gupta
John, it's Mike. Let me take the first one. Ad load is low, very low, as I've stated in my remarks. We are first and foremost focused on a good user experience. We will factor in advertiser demand, though. As I mentioned in the Q4 call, ad load went up very slightly driven by advertiser demand. And really the balance in the trade-off we have there is the quality of the advertising. And if we think we can serve high-quality, relevant ads, that's something we'll consider as we're looking at ad load. But truly, it's the user experience that's the first factor in the guiding factor for us. On ROI, if we think about ROI for advertisers, it truly does vary by advertiser and their objective for the brands. Dick talked about in his response to TV some of the studies that we're seeing around Twitter and TV and some of the closed group studies that we've seen. And that is proving out the ROI and the effectiveness of Twitter advertising, in addition to other forms of advertising. For the SMBs, we continue to enhance our direct response suite. We talked about the app download Card. We've introduced the Lead Gen Card. We've introduced the website Card, a whole host of things. And we think as we continue to give them ad formats that drives specific actions that meet their objectives, we think we'll continue to drive up their ROI because they'll get better conversion and better results more aligned with their objectives.
Richard Costolo
And I'll just -- again, a couple more points about ROI, we consistently hear from marketers that they get better-than-expected ROI on the platform, everyone from large global brands like American Express to GetTaxi, a mobile apps has said that using our mobile app promotion suite, we're now -- Twitter is now their #1 customer acquisition channel; folks like American Apparel who use our Lead Gen Cards to get new customers to sign up. The customers they got from Twitter have an average order value of $90, which is about 15% higher than their normal average order value. So across the spectrum of advertisers from apps and SMBs, the large global brands, and we're delivering ROI for our customers.

And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Twitter's Chief Executive Officer, Dick Costolo.
Richard Costolo
Thanks, Krista. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings call. Since this is our first call as a public company, I want to give you an overview here of how this will go today.
For the benefit of those who didn't see our IPO roadshow, I'll start with a quick overview of what Twitter is and what makes us unique. I'll then speak quickly to the company's fourth quarter performance and our top priorities for 2014 before turning it over to our CFO, Mike Gupta, who will go a bit deeper on our quarterly performance and outlook. Then once Mike is done, I'll end with a few closing comments on how we're viewing the market, how we're thinking about the long-term opportunity, and then we'll open the lines for your questions.
Okay. Twitter is the only platform that is simultaneously public, real-time, conversational and widely distributed. No other platform combines all these elements at scale. Anyone can create a tweet, and tweets can be read by anyone, and this has created a level playing field, essentially democratizing content creation and distribution.
As a result, Twitter enables a single voice to echo around the world instantly and unfiltered. As a case in point, we saw some powerful user moments in Q4, whether it was the more than 5.4 million tweets shared on the news of Nelson Mandela's passing in December, the 1.7 million tweets sent in just a couple hours as soccer fans around the globe anxiously awaited the fate of their country's team in the World Cup draw. Hundreds of millions of users continue to flock to Twitter every month to experience moments in their lives and moments in the world. When events happen, the event itself and the conversation surrounding the event unfold on Twitter.
A great TV example is NBC's show, The Voice, one of the most-watched programs on television. During an episode in November, The Voice gave fans a 5-minute window in the live show to save their favorite contestant by tweeting that performer's name with the hashtag #VoiceSave. The show's celebrity coaches also joined in, tweeting their followers to rally support for their favorite contestants. And hundreds of thousands of tweets later, Kat Robichaud, a young woman from Raleigh, North Carolina, was the first reality competition contestant saved by a Twitter vote.
It's moments like these, coupled with a strong holiday shopping season, that helped drive great Q4 results for us. Total revenue reached $243 million, up 116% year-over-year. Ad revenue reached $220 million, up 121% year-over-year; and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margins reached 18%. Mike will get into a lot more detail on these results in a few minutes.
First, I want to talk about our user growth. We are confident in our ability to continue to scale revenue by expanding our global reach and introducing and scaling new ad products even as we continue to maintain some of the industry's strictest limits on ad load in order to optimize for the user experience.
With confidence in our ability to scale revenue, we are doubling down in 2014 to accelerate the growth of our core user base. Let me talk to you for a bit about how we started down that path in Q4, and then I'll talk about 2014 more broadly.
By bringing the content of Twitter forward and pushing the scaffolding of the language of Twitter to the background, we can increase high-quality interactions and make it more likely that new or casual users will find this service as indispensable as our existing core users do. And we took initial steps in that direction with the introduction of media forward timelines and in-line social actions in October, and we're already starting to see early signs that those initiatives are working well.
For example, user interaction in the form of favorites and retweets is up more than 35% since launching these features in Q4.
Other recent changes like putting direct messaging front and center in our native mobile apps on iOS and Android are also driving increased interaction, with messaging up more than 25% just since that change. Search has also become one of our fastest-growing features, with a 120% increase in total searches year-over-year.
Outside of the core product experience, we're also rolling out a number of improvements that we expect will have a positive impact on user growth and retention over time. These include much simpler user onboarding experiences with native mobile sign-ups, along with other methods of reengaging inactive users. It's important to realize, however, that it will be a combination of changes introduced over the course of the year that we believe will start to change the slope of the growth curve.
Furthermore, I want to point out that some product changes we could make could result in short-term fluctuations in some of our operational metrics, particularly timeline views. As a quick reminder, timeline views are kind of a proxy for the amount of content our users consume. They were impacted in Q4 by a series of product improvements across both iOS and Android that were designed to increase interaction per timeline view. Those product changes worked extremely well, driving total interactions and interaction per timeline view up significantly.
We are essentially increasing the value of each timeline view as users are interacting with their timeline views at a much higher rate than ever before. And the more people interact with each other and the content on Twitter, the better it is for our users, our partners, advertisers and for the company, obviously.
Threaded conversations are another great example of this. Threaded conversations make it much easier to follow a conversation on Twitter but also cut down on timeline views, because users no longer need to scroll back and forth to find and interact with related replies. We believe that this new conversation approach offers a better experience for existing users and, more importantly, helps new users more quickly grasp the conversational nature of the platform.
We see significant room also for monetization growth in 2014. We're rolling out and scaling new ad products with great success. In Q4, we saw strong adoption of our self-serve product in the U.S. We launched a number of important targeting capabilities to better serve both brand and direct response advertisers who can now create tailored audiences, track online conversions and directly target TV conversations happening on Twitter.
We also began the international expansion of our self-serve ad platform with launches in the U.K., Canada and Ireland. These initiatives are just beginning but are already off to a great start, and we have many more important launches coming in 2014 as we continue to expand our platform and offerings again for users, partners and advertisers.
I'm also proud of the progress the team has made here in increasing the quality and pace of our product launches. We made a considerable effort in 2013 to develop a more robust mobile experimentation framework, which is helping us significantly increase our product launch cadence. We developed this infrastructure to help us iterate and test new ideas much more quickly, and we're seeing the benefit both in terms of the quality and quantity of product launches.
One of our core values as a company is to reach every person on the planet. And in 2014, we're focused on building a Twitter that is truly accessible and valuable to everyone. We launched a few things that really started to get that flywheel of increased user interaction going in Q4, and I'm delighted with the early results.
Importantly, these results give us confidence in our other hypotheses about the product. Let me outline just a few of those initiatives that are on the 2014 roadmap for you.
One, we're making significant improvements in the new user experience, as I referenced, particularly on mobile. Every day we see more new user sign-ups on mobile devices, which gives us an enormous opportunity to connect new users immediately to friends and contacts already on our platform.
We know that tight mutual connections drive higher interaction from day one and significantly increase engagement over time.
Two, we believe that the integration of richer media experiences will help make Twitter more accessible to a broader audience. We've already taken steps in that direction with the simple launch of media forward timelines in the fourth quarter, and I couldn't be more pleased with those results. We will continue to invest to make Twitter a more visually engaging medium across a number of dimensions, the launch of media forward in Q4 just being the beginning.
Three, we will continue to invest to make Twitter a better tool for conversation, both public and private. The conversational use case is a daily habit already for many of our users, and we believe that by building features that enhance conversations and messaging, we will help attract more users to the platform and deepen the engagement of those we already have.
Last but not least, fourth, we want to do a better job organizing content for our users along topical lines rather than just chronological lines. We believe that topic-based discovery on our platform will make Twitter easier to understand and use for everyone.
We think there's a lot we can do to significantly improve the user experience over the course of the year in 2014, so you will see us launch much more in each of those areas, as well as other areas. We believe the changes we're making will create a much more satisfying experience for users in their first few days, weeks and then months and years on Twitter and ultimately lead to higher engagement and user growth over time.
And with that, I'll hand it over to Mike here to go deeper into our Q4 financial performance and outlook.
Mike Gupta
Thank you, Dick, and good afternoon, everyone. I will walk you through our financial and operating performance for Q4 and then touch briefly on our guidance before returning it back over to Dick for his closing remarks.
Given that this is our first earnings call, I thought it would be helpful to quickly review the drivers of our advertising business and how we measure each before turning to the Q4 results. As a reminder, the key drivers of our ad business are reach, engagement and monetization. We measure reach in terms of our active user base or monthly active users. We measure engagement by looking at timeline views per monthly active user, and we measure monetization in terms of ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views.
I will cover each in more detail in a few minutes, but first, our financials. We are very pleased with our Q4 financial results. In fact, it was our strongest quarter to date. As Dick mentioned, revenue in the fourth quarter reached $243 million, up 116% from the year-ago period and up 44% sequentially.
Ad revenue reached $220 million, up 121% from last year and up 43% from the third quarter, driven by strong ad revenue per timeline view. Ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views reached $1.49, up 76% from the prior year and up 54% quarter-over-quarter.
A number of factors contributed to the strong performance. First, we saw a significant increase in ad engagements, which are up more than 600% from the prior year and up more than 70% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by a number of recent product innovations, including media forward, where photos and videos are represented front and center in your home timeline.
We also saw strong advertiser demand across all channels during the Q4 holiday shopping season, and we benefited from a number of prediction and ad-targeting improvements that we rolled out in 2013. Mobile also continued to be a strong driver in the fourth quarter, with more than 75% of total ad revenue being generated from mobile devices. This is up from more than 55% in the prior year.
Data licensing and other revenue contributed $23 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 80% year-over-year. This includes $8 million of revenue recognized on a net basis from MoPub, which we acquired in late October. Without MoPub, data licensing and other revenue grew 20% year-over-year.
In Q4, international revenue represented 27% of total revenue, up approximately 200% year-over-year. And while we've made good progress building out our international sales and marketing teams, we are still in the early stages of expansion.
Let me now turn to ad engagements and cost per ad engagement, but first, some context. As a reminder, the vast majority of our advertising revenue comes from pay-for-performance products that are sold through an auction. Like comparable ad platforms, our auctions are based on maximizing the yield of each ad unit and not the cost per ad engagement. Our auction is ranked broadly on a combination of ad quality and cost per engagement. Higher-quality ads, more relevant ads, have a higher predicted engagement rate and, therefore, do not have to bid as high to win the auction, resulting in a lower cost per ad engagement. This form of auction helps us to ensure that our users see the most relevant and engaging ads.
In addition to providing a positive user experience around ads, we are very focused on improving advertiser ROI and making our platform more accessible to a broader range of advertisers. To that end, we are constantly making improvements to our ad products and our prediction and targeting capabilities.
Over time, these changes have resulted in higher-quality ads, a lower average cost per ad engagement and a higher number of total ad engagements. In Q4, average cost per ad engagement was down 18% quarter-over-quarter. This was more than offset by the 70%-plus increase in total ad engagements that I mentioned earlier, thereby improving our overall yield while maintaining the quality of our user experience and increasing advertiser ROI.
Ad load also affects user experience, of course, and we continue to be very conservative in the number of ads we show our users, both on an absolute basis and relative to others in the industry.
Turning now to expenses. I want to remind you that unless otherwise noted, my comments will focus on our non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and income tax effects related to acquisitions.
For the GAAP financial measures, as well as the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release posted on our IR website.
In Q4, total expenses were $226 million, up 102% year-over-year and up 22% from the previous quarter. The increase was driven primarily by headcount and related overhead costs as we continued to invest in our workforce to scale our business and drive continued product innovation on our platform. We ended the year with approximately 2,700 employees.
Let me now provide you with a quick breakdown of operating expense by line item. Cost of sales for the fourth quarter were $63 million, R&D costs were $68 million. Sales and marketing costs were $72 million, and general and administrative costs were $23 million. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of $45 million compared to $18 million in the prior year period, representing an EBITDA margin of 18% in Q4.
Non-GAAP net income was $10 million in the fourth quarter, up from a non-GAAP net loss of approximately $300,000 in the same period a year ago. Our GAAP net loss was $511 million, which includes $521 million of stock-based compensation expense. Of this total stock-based compensation, $406 million is related to restricted stock units granted to employees and, in accordance with GAAP, was previously unrecognized until the effective date of our IPO.
Before I turn to metrics, let me cover a few items related to cash and CapEx. We ended the year with roughly $2.2 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our Q4 CapEx was $89 million, $60 million of which was financed through capital leases, with the remaining $29 million purchased outright as property and equipment. Our total CapEx spend in Q4 reflects the continued investment in co-located data centers and office facilities.
Now I'd like to turn to our operating metrics. First, let's talk about reach. Our monthly active users for the fourth quarter were 241 million, up 30% from last year and up 4% from the third quarter. In terms of geographic breakdown, U.S. MAUs reached 54 million, up 21% from last year and up 3% sequentially. International MAUs were 187 million, up 33% from last year and up 4% sequentially.
Next is engagement or timeline views. Timeline views for the fourth quarter were approximately 148 billion, up 26% from last year but down 7% from the third quarter as we made a series of product changes across both iOS and Android designed to increase user interaction per timeline view.
Moving now to ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views. As I mentioned earlier, it reached $1.49 in Q4, up 76% year-over-year. This reflects U.S. ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views of $3.80 and international ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views of $0.60.
Before I turn to guidance, I want to quickly provide some context around the strong holiday season that we saw in Q4. Large brand advertisers drove a significant portion of our growth with particularly strong spend around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We saw broad-based demand across a number of verticals, including consumer products, retail and financial services.
Advertisers are increasingly recognizing that conversions -- conversations on Twitter provide a valuable opportunity to connect with consumers in real-time. And in Q4, we saw a record number of retailers flock to Twitter to do just that.
Now let's turn to our outlook. While Q4 was a strong quarter for us, we believe part of it was driven by seasonal factors as advertisers typically spend more in Q4 due to the holiday shopping season and less in Q1 as they reset their budgets. Despite this seasonal trend, we expect total revenue in the range of $230 million to $240 million.
With regard to MoPub, we won't be giving explicit guidance, but note that as an ad exchange, we expect that MoPub will also be impacted by the same seasonal trends. In terms of data licensing, we expect that business to be roughly flat in Q1 and for the remainder of the year as we remain focused on growing our core advertising business.
Finally, moving on to profit and stock-based compensation expense for Q1, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $10 million to $16 million and stock-based compensation expense to be in the range of $145 million to $155 million.
For full year 2014, we expect total revenues of between $1.15 billion and $1.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $150 million to $180 million and stock-based compensation expense in the range of $600 million to $650 million, with CapEx between $330 million to $390 million.
I will now turn the call back to Dick for a few closing remarks before we open the call to questions.
Richard Costolo
Thanks, Mike. In summary, we feel very well positioned for growth in 2014. We will reach many more people, and we'll build on our core value propositions for users, partners and advertisers.
For users, we will continue to make the product easier to use and introduce new capabilities that we believe will preserve the experience that core users love while making it easier for new users to understand the product and experience the unique content on our platform right away.
For partners, we'll continue to leverage our media relationships to drive more content distribution to our platform and for advertisers, we'll launch new ad products that provide even more powerful targeting capabilities, both for brand and direct response advertisers. And we'll launch new ad formats that we believe will increase demand for marketers and engagement from users.
We have only scratched the surface of what we believe Twitter can become. None of this progress, of course, would be possible without our amazing users, our talented employees, so I want to quickly thank all of them for a phenomenal 2013. We certainly wouldn't be here without them.
And with that, we'll open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs.
Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Dick, you've touched on the fact that there were some factors that negatively impacted what would have been normal timeline growth due to the product enhancements. Was there anything like that, that would have impacted user growth in the quarter or made the growth rate in Q4 less comparable to the number that you guys printed for Q3? And then to the extent that you're talking about all of the things that should drive accelerating user growth in 2014, realize we're a month in, but any early indications that you're seeing in January of the impact from all of the product enhancements you've been making to drive user growth?
Richard Costolo
Yes. Great, Heath. Thanks very much. Let me take those together, I guess, and take a couple of minutes to really frame how we're thinking about this. I would say up until last year, our growth has been viral and organic. Growth was something that happened to us. And as I've mentioned, we've launched a few things in Q4 that really started to get that flywheel of increased user interaction going, and because we're so happy with those early results, again, favorites and retweets, up 35% just in the quarter; direct messages, up 25%, et cetera, because of that, that gives us confidence that the hypotheses we have based on our user research and our data, about the roadmap we've crafted, that gives us confidence that, that roadmap will be successful. Again, so if you think about that roadmap, let me dive a little bit deeper into that. Going back to that statement I made about Twitter being the only platform that is simultaneously public, real-time, conversational and widely distributed, we believe those 4 pillars are the right 4 pillars to help us reach every connected person on the planet. In other words, we don't think we need to change anything about the characteristics of our platform, we simply need to make Twitter a better Twitter. So let me talk about the things that we will do to enhance those 4 pillars and expand on what I already mentioned a bit. Again, we'll improve the new user experience, particularly on mobile. We have a number of initiatives underway to improve the onboarding process of new users and get them up to speed very quickly. The native mobile sign-up that we're launching that allows us to make onboarding much more seamless for people and quickly connect you with the people you know who are already on Twitter. Our user research tells us that this drives increased interaction from day one and significantly higher growth over time. Two, that integration of those richer media experiences helps make Twitter more accessible, I think, is the proper word, to a broader audience. We've already taken steps in that direction with that launch of media forward. We'll continue to invest to make Twitter a more visually engaging medium across a number of dimensions. That launch of media forward you should think of is just the very tip of the iceberg. Three, and I'll expand on one of the other points I made in my prepared remarks a little bit, we'll continue to make Twitter a better tool for conversations, both public and private. The conversational use case is a daily habit for many of our users. I talked frequently about Twitter being this global town square. And when you're walking through the town square and observing something, you often want to whisper to the person next to you about the thing you're both observing. So that notion of private messaging that we've brought forward and seeing it increased 25% in just one quarter is in service to enhancing that back and forth between the public and private conversation. We believe that by building features that enhance those conversations and messaging, we will help attract more users to the platform and deepen the engagement of those we already have. And finally, as I mentioned, we'll do a better job of organizing content for our users along topical lines and relevance lines rather than just chronological lines. We believe that topic-based discovery on the platform makes Twitter easier to understand and use for everyone. We've just started to focus on these changes. As I mentioned, this first set of interaction-facing launches we came out with in Q4 have seen great results. And again, those results give us confidence that the kinds of things we hypothesize about elsewhere in the product will be successful. So those additive changes over the course of the year that will be in service to making Twitter even more public, real-time, conversational, widely distributed, will start to change the slope of that growth curve going forward.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay, guys. Just a couple of questions. I hate to kind of beat the dead horse, but, Dick, you guys have said that the #1 priority is driving MAU acceleration. And I guess, given the amount of attention that Twitter got in the fourth quarter around the IPO and just in general, and the fact that you guys have been testing a lot of these new features, did any of these new rollouts create MAU churn, or were you disappointed by the level of MAU growth that you saw in the quarter? And then the second question is just kind of high-level. Can you guys give us a rough breakdown on revenue coming in from the various advertiser buckets? So like what percentage is from Ad Age 100 versus kind of your middle market or your SMB channels?
Richard Costolo
Yes. Ross, thanks. This is Dick. I guess I'll frame that for you by going back to the way I think about the infrastructure that we're building in service to delivering on the roadmap we're building towards. So for example, the benefit of having an infrastructure now that allows us to test many more things and experiments and ideas simultaneously and then analyze the results of those experiments more quickly across a number of dimensions, allows us to do things like build on a set of metrics like the interactions we were driving in Q4 in service to then making these additive changes to the new user experience and the kinds of content that we're going to be driving more of into the product around media and these different content discovery experiences around relevance-based timelines, topic-based timelines. I really think of it as the collection of these things that we want to do over the arc of the entire product throughout the course of the year that will deliver the change in the slope of the growth curve we want to see, not -- I think it's not the way we look at those experiment results as whether they have a direct line to MAU. We know from our user research the kinds of things that cause users to become more engaged and stick with the product and core and make it indispensable to them. So it's those things that we're looking to drive into the product. We're seeing the early results of those things like the things we launched in Q4, having the kinds of results we'd hope they have. So it's my hope and our belief and why we are confident in our hypotheses that those will continue to deliver the kind of results we expect, all in service to the user growth we all hope to see.
Mike Gupta
Ross, this is Mike. I'll take the second question. So we don't disclose the ad revenue by channel, but just to give you some context here, we saw strength across all channels in Q4. And as you know, we benefit from having started really at the top of the funnel with the large branded advertisers and the Ad Age 100, with virtually all of them being advertisers on our platform. We have a concerted effort to move down to the mid-market and the SMBs, and with -- some of the things we're doing around targeting and direct response. We're seeing nice uptake in the mid-market channel. And then with self-serve, as you know, we launched last year here in the U.S., and we've launched internationally now in countries like the U.K., Ireland and Canada. And while it's still early, we're seeing nice results there. So with some of the added targeting capabilities, things like Lead Gen Cards, et cetera, we're seeing nice uptake from the mid-market and the SMB. So that continues to grow.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
I wanted to follow up on engagement but shift over a little bit and just talk about timeline views and hoping that you can help us sort of prioritize or weight the impacts that you saw on timeline views and just -- this is somewhat of a shift, I guess, from sort of quantity to really the quality of timeline views. How should we think about the growth of timeline views going forward and what you saw? Is it fully product-based and serve a function of your own changes? Or you think that there was something else going on? And I also just wanted to ask you about your thoughts on e-commerce on the platform going forward?
Richard Costolo
Sure. I guess the way I would answer that is to say that timeline views and timeline views per MAU are a measure of engagement. When we look at the experiments we're running and we look at the kinds of things we're trying to deliver into the product, it is absolutely the case that the volume of interactions per timeline view was something we were hoping to drive with the things that we -- capabilities we launched in Q4, and that was successful. And we're seeing that again in the kinds of metrics I talked to you about and the kinds of increased engagements you saw from Mike on the advertising front as well. I guess I'll hand it over to Mike to see if he's -- you've got anything you want to add there, vis-à-vis color on revenue and so forth.
Mike Gupta
Yes. So I think as it relates, Doug, to the timeline views, it is a relevant metric. We think of it a little more long term in nature. We will see fluctuations, especially as we're experimenting and looking at these products. And we do think the combination of all these things will drive the user growth, as well as higher engagement, if you will, or interactions with the timeline views. So we are looking at both. We do think delivering more value in those timelines to our users and having high-quality timelines is important. So that's part of the focus. But think of timeline views as long term. And then on e-commerce, Dick, do you want to take...
Richard Costolo
Yes, sure. So I think as is well known, we hired Nathan Hubbard, who was the CEO of Ticketmaster, to come in last year and explore commerce opportunities on Twitter. It's the case today that commerce really takes place all the time on Twitter, now, in-the-moment commerce that we see constantly across the platform. Some of those activities are activities that we've engaged in ourselves with other companies. American Express and Starbucks are 2 great examples of in-the-moment commerce that we've trialed on Twitter, and those have been extremely successful. But there are others that brands engage in every day on their own. So if you think about the commerce, the in-the-moment commerce opportunity and the way we've developed the Cards platform -- for those of you who are unfamiliar with Cards, it's our way of adding a rich canvas and additional kinds of action to Twitter in which the 140 characters really becomes a caption to this much richer card that carries with it interactivity and actions. That will be the vehicle through which we think about commerce opportunities. We don't have any current plans or timelines or -- to announce right now, but when we do, we'll come back to you certainly.
Krista Bessinger
And the next question we're going to take is from the Twitter stream that comes from the account of Colin Sebastian at RW Baird.
And he asks, how do you plan to balance monetization with improving the user experience and driving further user and timeline view growth?
Mike Gupta
Great. Thanks Krista and thanks Colin. I'll take that one. So I think we've talked about the user and timeline view growth, but let me take the first part of the question. We are very focused on the user experience and, in particular, as it relates to the ads that they experience on the platform. And when you look at what we've achieved from an ad revenue per timeline view growth, per 1,000 timeline views, that's up 54% sequentially and up over 75% year-over-year. So we've seen strong growth in ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views. And what's important to note, that was primarily or largely driven by an increase in ad engagements. And those -- that increase in ad engagements is coming from several things: one, it's the fact that we've improved our prediction and targeting capabilities; second, we have a strong broad base of advertiser demand as we continue to iterate on the ad platform. We've brought in a broader array of advertisers. This has all resulted in our ability to serve our users more relevant and higher-quality ads, and we see that translate in the increase in ad engagements. So in the quarter, there was a very modest increase in ad load. And I would remind you, that was also driven by the fact that we had increased demand in the strong Q4 shopping season here from our advertisers. And so the -- we're very cognizant of balancing it. We think, with the improvements we're making on the ad platform, we can do that. And as it relates to ad load and the ultimate user experience, we feel like we have a meaningful runway ahead of us, and we're low not only on an absolute basis but also relative to others in the industry.
Operator
Our next question comes from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley. [Technical Difficulty] Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Mike, I think you talked about being very conservative in terms of ad load. Could you quantify a little bit how you think about your ad load versus what else is out there in the industry, say, Facebook's 5%, how we should think about where your ad load is versus there and versus where it could go in the future? And then any quick comments on the adoption of the Amplify product?
Mike Gupta
Sure. So let me take Amplify first. We feel good about that. The adoption, while early, has been really strong, and we see tremendous promise in that. We continue to build on it. We think it's a great extension of reach for the content providers, as well as advertisers. In Q4 alone, we signed a host of new partners, including Major League Baseball, the English Premier league, College Football, 60 Minutes and many others. So again, it's still early. It's a small business today, but it's growing nicely and we feel good about the prospects there. As it relates to ad load, we're not going to share a specific number. But I think if you were to just look at the ad load even as a user, you would see that it's very light. And as I said, light relative to others in the industry, and we believe very much even on an absolute basis. So we're very cognizant about that ad load. And as far as taking ad load up, as I mentioned, there was a modest increase in Q4. That was again largely driven by the fact that we had high-quality advertiser demand and, therefore, high-quality relevant ads to share with our users. So we look at that as a key component in how we would drive ad load going forward.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.
A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Appreciated the guidance for 2014, both revenues and EBITDA. Looks like about 14% margins at the midpoint, which are going to be up from 2013 by a few points. Just maybe, from a high level, how the company thinks about margin improvement and investing in growth versus delivering bottom line results?
Mike Gupta
It's Mike. Thanks for the question. Yes. Look, we see a large opportunity ahead of us. And as you've noted, we've continued -- we invested in 2013. We will continue to invest in 2014. And that investment, frankly, will be across the board. It will be on the infrastructure side to make sure our business scales as the number of users and the amount of rich media on the platform scales. We'll continue to invest on the sales side as we expand internationally, and we'll invest on the R&D and engineering side as we continue to build and innovate on the products, both on the ad platform, as well as the user platform. So we see a lot of opportunity. We will absolutely continue to invest in the near to medium term. And what I would say is I would refer you back to the long-term margin that we shared when we were on the roadshow and remind everyone that there's nothing structural about our business that we think prevents us from getting to those margins, nor getting to the margins that you see broadly across the industry.
Krista Bessinger
And the next question comes from the Twitter account of @SandHillInsight.
And Chuck Jones asks, what was the MoPub contribution for the December quarter? And was it all in advertising revenue?
Mike Gupta
Great. Thanks for the question, Chuck. So MoPub contribution was $8 million in Q4. That, just a reminder, was a net revenue number. So we recognize that on a net basis, and that shows up in our data licensing and other line. And just as another reminder, we believe MoPub, as a mobile ad exchange, will pay some of those same seasonal trends going into Q1.
Operator
Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner of Bernstein.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I want to go back to the user growth. If you triple the number of domestic users you add in a quarter to 3 million, it would take you about 12 years to get to 200 million users. Do you think Twitter will get to 200 million U.S. domestic -- U.S. users with, say, 5 or 6 years? Or in other words, do you expect the improvements that you mentioned to have a much greater impact than tripling the number of quarterly user adds?
Richard Costolo
Yes. So this is Dick. Thanks, Carlos. Again, I'll go back to -- we have a very, very clear roadmap across a number of dimensions that we will use to drive interaction and engagement and make it easier for a broader audience to get Twitter, to understand Twitter more quickly because of the success we've seen in the first few things we did in service to that goal in Q4, very specifically around the hypotheses we had based on the user research we saw. Because of that success on that increase in interactions, we believe that the cumulative effect of the changes we make over the course of the year, along exactly the kinds of dimensions I talked about, will result in changing the slope of the growth curve. We have every confidence that, that will happen. What exactly the slope of that curve looks like and when it will occur is not something I can guess at. It will be the cumulative effect of those changes that we make to the product over the course of the year that we believe very confidently will have that impact. One of the reasons we've invested so heavily in those infrastructure changes, that allow us to experiment more quickly and more broadly, is precisely so that we can speed the impact of these kind of changes we want to make, this multiple set of changes that we want to make.
Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
Just a quick follow-up, Dick. How many -- can you give us a sense as to how many people come on the platform, tried Twitter and then leave because they couldn't curate [ph] a good enough feed or for any other reason? Because that seems to be the problem that you're trying to address.
Richard Costolo
Yes. We're not going to speak specifically to the -- to any specific numbers of new user retention or so forth. What I will say, and I said this I think the morning of our IPO, is we have massive global awareness of Twitter, and we need to bridge that gap between awareness of Twitter and deep engagement on the platform. So it is absolutely the case that it is very much about making it easier for people who first come to the platform to get it more quickly. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's not just get it in the first weeks and months on Twitter, it's get it in the first moments, the first day on Twitter. So that is absolutely, absolutely a focus area for us.

Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Two, one on the advertising side. I wanted to understand a little bit more color on your conversations with advertisers as they think about Twitter as a platform from 2014 and beyond and what would bend the trajectory of dollars they're allocating to Twitter, whether it's user engagements or the type of ad products you're serving up to users and/or sort of attribution statistics you're able to provide back to advertisers to get them more comfortable with the platform generally. Second question, Dick, I think this one's for you. But other social media companies have seen the need to go outside of their main platform or mobile application to add capability in separate apps to drive broader adoption of their larger ad ecosystem and I wanted to know how much of what you want to accomplish at Twitter can be done inside the Twitter mobile app, or you might need to launch additional apps that might address more narrow niches of functionality.
Richard Costolo
Sure. So I think what we'll do is let me have Mike tackle the first couple there, and then I'll jump back in on your third question.
Mike Gupta
Great. So as it relates to conversations with advertisers, over the last 18 months, 2 years, it's gone very much from, ""Why advertise on Twitter,"" to, ""How do I advertise on Twitter, and how do I do that effectively?"" And so we continue to see advertisers come to the platform and, frankly, get better at leveraging the power of the native ad unit. And those conversations, as they continue, we see that they like the ROI that they're seeing. They like what they're seeing as far as Twitter being a companion to life in the moment and these large events that we're all aware of. And so those are very positive conversations. What we see also by way of ROI and how they think about Twitter more and more as we develop more products and improve the targeting capabilities, we're giving them better and improved tools to see that ROI, and they're also seeing those results. So as an example, when you look for more of the direct response-oriented advertisers, we launched our Lead Gen Card in beta early last year and then full launched late last year. The uptake from those advertisers has been great. We've now launched conversion tracking for them. We have things like app downloads. So all of these things really allow those types of advertisers to get a clear line of sight to their ROIs. For the large branded folks, Twitter in TV is very much a part of the conversation. You asked about some of the studies and things like that. Millward Brown, a division of WPP, had conducted a study, and TV ad recall was up. I believe it's roughly 14% or so for folks who are using Twitter. The Nielsen study from late last year, folks who engaged with promoted tweets, brand favorability was 30% higher; purchase intent was 50% higher. So we're seeing a lot of those closed loop studies that point to the attribution, and those are being well received. And as far as budgets moving beyond experimentation, obviously, it's hard to generalize because we have advertisers in different points in that cycle. But in general, yes, we are seeing advertisers on the platform continuing to improve spend. So if we're going to look at a subsection like the Ad Age on average, that's going up year-over-year, and so we feel good about that. Let me turn over to Dick for the second question.
Richard Costolo
Okay. Let me maybe give you a framework through which -- or the lens rather -- the lens through which I think about this one app, multiple apps question, and then that will drive me toward my ultimate answer. The question that I think of that's relevant here is do we have a platform that's differentiated? And does it remain differentiated over the long term? And we believe that we do. We live in a world where we know there are going to be multiple social services. It's not the case that one app or one use case wins over the other. Each one carves out a use case and tries to do that job better than anyone else. Twitter, we think of, is the best product in the world for real-time, in-the-moment interaction, conversation and discovery. That's driven by a number of unique characteristics we have, including the fact that we have a short form format that drives fast consumption. And then that's how users see us, as the place to go for real-time in-the-moment conversation and discovery. So we do believe we have significant differentiation. We're a really unique product, and the uniqueness of the product derives from what I said before, meaning we're the only platform that's public, real-time, conversational and distributed. What that means in a practical sense is that we're the place that information breaks first. We're the place that real-time discovery of content happens. We're the place that exists as the consummate second screen, both the TV and for any experience that's happening in the world, and no other service can say that. So given that perspective, I don't have any particular religion about whether that means we need to land at one end of the continuum or other on specific use case apps or not. I absolutely think it could be the case that there are capabilities we want to integrate into the core service that we think could be better if they had an accompanying single-use app to go alongside them. But I don't have a perspective that we need to push ourselves in one direction or the other on the continuum in service to having a platform that's differentiated over the long term.

Our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie.

Dick, for many years, I think display advertising online has arguably failed to live up to expectations while search arguably performed better. However, it seems that over the past year or so, platforms like Facebook and Twitter have really shown that display targeting can be much more effective than traditional online. So my question is, one, do you agree with that? And two, what are the specific changes and innovations that are happening so recently that are enabling Twitter and others to be so much more effective than the traditional banners and other formats? And then second question, separately, just can you comment on the potential for video engagement on the Twitter platform? Meaning, instead of sending users off-platform, actually keeping them on Twitter while they watch video and video ads?
Richard Costolo
Yes. I mean, I'll answer the second question first because it's faster. I think there's an enormous opportunity there, and we will continue to innovate in that area. That's absolutely a place you will continue to see us invest in and make progress on. In regards to your first question, I really think it's because in the mobile world, that display ad can no longer be -- because frankly of the real estate, that display ad can no longer be an interruption through which a marketer tries to communicate more loudly than the content on the screen. It has to be that -- that advertisement has to be content that's relevant for the user. It has to be. And so that has made it the case that marketers have begun to understand more and more that when they communicate in the context of what's already happening for that user, and we see that all the time on our platform, marketers understanding how to engage in the moment and some of the most successful marketing campaigns on Twitter being those in-the-moment communications in the context of what's already happening, I think that's frankly that constraint, that real estate constraint, that has led us to the native mobile ad unit, where the ad is content first. You can reply, favorite, retweet a promoted tweet just like you can any other tweet, has led us down this path where the ads perform better when they're content first. And I think the other kinds of implications that we see as a result of that only enhance that benefit. So as a follow-on example of that, having marketers understand that the beauty of the one-to-one marketing that had for many, many years, I think, been sort of a mythological creature, this notion of one-to-one marketing, now on a platform, on a social platform where you can engage as a brand in one-to-one marketing with a customer and then have that direct engagement be amplified by the customer, him or herself and by the followers of that customer, enables these kinds of things that marketers had always talked about but had never really benefited from its high value. Previously, a one-to-one marketing engagement was just that. You got the benefit from the one person you engaged with. You now get these -- this ROI from that one-to-one marketing, and I think that, that combination of the native ad unit and true one-to-one marketing that's amplified has made a -- it just makes the ads better in this environment.

And we have time now just for one last question, and that question comes from the Twitter stream from the account of Arvind Bhatia.
And his question is how dependent is 2014 guidance on improvement in user engagement versus ad load, ad engagement and ad pricing?
Mike Gupta
Great. Arvind, thanks for the question. So as we look at 2014 guidance, from a user perspective, we are not assuming any significant inflection point in the user growth curve. From an engagement perspective, it's more about ad revenue per 1,000 timeline views, and it's really a combination of ad engagement and, to a certain extent, ad pricing. And really, where I'd focus it is on as we improve the ad products and improve our targeting and prediction capabilities, we think that will bring more relevant and higher-quality ads to our users, as well the fact that we're seeing a broader array of advertisers come to the platform. So we think the combination of those will drive higher-quality ads, which, in turn, will drive higher ad engagement and, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, may have CPE, or cost per ad engagement, going down. But we really think it's the improvement on the ad revenue per timeline view side that will drive the guidance that we're talking about.
Richard Costolo
