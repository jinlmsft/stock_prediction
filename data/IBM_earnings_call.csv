Thanks Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us. The fourth quarter capped off a year where we grew revenue, operating pre-tax income, and operating earnings per share. We stabilized our margin as we moved through the year, and we expanded gross and pre-tax margin in the fourth quarter. We continued to invest and take actions to shift our business toward higher-value areas like hybrid cloud and AI, including the announcement of our acquisition of Red Hat.
And we again generated solid free cash flow, which enables this continued investment and shareholder returns. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $21.8 billion of revenue, which was down 1% at constant currency, though down 3% with the impact of currency translation.
As always, I’ll focus on constant currency results. Our operating pre-tax income was $5 billion, and we had $4.87 of operating earnings per share. We had strong performance in software, and in services we had revenue growth and gross margin expansion. This was offset by the expected impact of our IBM Z product cycle dynamics.
Our total software revenue was up 2%. We entered the quarter with a good pipeline of software opportunities, and we executed well, driven by hybrid cloud adoption and strong demand for analytics and AI offerings.
Total services revenue was up 2%. We had steady improvement in Global Business Services throughout the year, with 6% growth in the fourth quarter and revenue growth and gross margin expansion across all three of our GBS business lines.
Global Technology Services had a modest revenue decline, with solid gross margin expansion. We had a great signings quarter, reflecting strong demand for hybrid cloud implementations and our value prop to deliver productivity. Our hardware revenue was down. You’ll recall in 2017 we had a terrific fourth quarter in IBM Z, and so our decline reflects a wrap on that performance.
This continues to be a very successful Z program and remains ahead of our prior cycle. Once again, we had strong growth in Power, with POWER9 now introduced throughout our portfolio.
As you know we provide technology and industry expertise to help run our clients’ most important processes, which puts us in a unique position to help them transform their businesses. As we exit 2018, we’re continuing to see a few themes across our engagements. First, our clients continue to look to turn data into competitive advantage by applying analytics and AI, with an industry lens.
Second, clients are increasingly looking to cloud to drive business value. As they move more mission-critical workloads to the cloud, they need to securely move data and workloads across multiple cloud environments and that requires a hybrid and open-cloud strategy.
And third, clients are focused on productivity and predictability in their spend. Now, IT has always been about driving both technology innovation and productivity, with the balance shifting over time. We’re recently seeing increasing interest in productivity as clients look forward to the next couple of years.
And so our results this quarter reflect our ability to deliver innovation and productivity you see this in our strong results in analytics and AI, in our as-a-Service cloud revenue, and in strong signings in our services business that deliver technology solutions and economic value, all through our integrated value proposition. That’s why companies such as Vodafone and BNP Paribas are leveraging the IBM Cloud, where they benefit from our hybrid multi-cloud capabilities and access to the most advanced technologies. And it’s why Bradesco Bank made a software, hardware and services multi-year commitment to the IBM Z platform, to take them to the next level in AI and hybrid IT, with more predictability in their operating cost.
Across our segments, our strategic imperatives revenue for the year was up 9% to about $40 billion. Within that, our cloud revenue is over $19 billion, and we exited the year with an annual run rate for cloud-delivered-as-a-Service of over $12 billion, which is up 21% over last year. This is a solid base of cloud and cognitive capabilities, and we’re continuing to deliver innovation in these high value areas. For example, in the fourth quarter we introduced AI OpenScale, a platform to manage the lifecycle of all forms of AI models, and Multicloud Manager, a service to deploy and manage complete applications, in any cloud environment.
We’re adding innovative services, like the world’s first commercial quantum computer available on the IBM Cloud. You may have seen that ExxonMobil is already using it to help address its most complex business challenges, such as energy exploration and chemicals manufacturing. The number of new clients using IBM Cloud Private accelerated in the fourth quarter, and adoption is growing for our IBM Cloud Private for Data platform, which was named a leader in the first quarter 2019 Forrester Wave report on Enterprise Insight Platforms. All of this is a validation of our hybrid, open approach to cloud, and we have a strong foundation from which to drive synergies across the business with the addition of Red Hat.
Let me pause here to remind you of the value we see from the combination of IBM and Red Hat, which is all about accelerating hybrid cloud adoption. The client response to the announcement has been overwhelmingly positive. They understand the power of this acquisition, and the combination of IBM and Red Hat capabilities, in helping them move beyond their initial cloud work to really shifting their business applications to the cloud.
They are concerned about the secure portability of data and workloads across cloud environments, about consistency in management and security protocols across clouds, and in avoiding vendor lock-in. They understand how the combination of IBM and Red Hat will help them address these issues.
We see the strong bookings Red Hat recently reported as further evidence of clients’ confidence in the value. Remember, the quarter ended a month after the transaction was announced. From a value perspective, in addition to the growing Red Hat business itself, we see an opportunity to lift all of IBM by selling more of our own IBM Cloud and by selling more of our analytics and AI capabilities on OpenShift across multiple platforms.
As clients proceed on their journey to get more business value from the cloud, they need more services help from the digital design, to app modernization, to native app development, to management of hybrid cloud environments. You saw last week the results of Red Hat’s shareholder vote, with very high participation, and over 99% voting in support.
We are moving through the regulatory process and continue to expect to close in the second half of 2019. We’ve had a decade-long partnership with Red Hat and extended it nearly a year ago around hybrid and multi-cloud. And now, after the announcement in late October, we’ve begun the internal enablement planning so we can hit the ground running post closing.
So now, I’ll go through the details of the fourth quarter, wrap up with a summary of the full year, and our view of 2019. As I said, our revenue in the quarter was $21.8 billion. This includes a currency hurt to revenue of over $500 million, which is 150 million more than mid-October spot rates suggested, as the dollar has continued to strengthen. Looking at our margin dynamics, we expanded both our gross and pre-tax operating margins.
Our gross margin was up 10 basis points, with strong performance in the services businesses, together up 190 basis points. This was mitigated by the expected mix headwind from the IBM Z cycle dynamics. Our operating expense was better 5%. When currency impacts the top line, it generally helps expense, due to both translation and the benefit of hedging contracts.
And so, with the strengthening of the dollar, currency helped our expense by nearly five points. Remember, the majority of our hedges are reflected in expense, and these hedging gains mitigate the currency impacts throughout the P&L. We’ve been focused on driving productivity in our business, implementing new ways of working, like using agile methodologies, and leveraging automation and infusing AI into our processes. This provides flexibility to drive innovation in areas like hybrid cloud, AI, security and blockchain, while also delivering operating leverage.
Within our expense decline, we also had a lower level of IP income. At the beginning of the year we said we expected IP income to be down year-to-year, and it has been tracking lower, down $165 million year-to-year in the fourth quarter, and nearly $450 million for the full year. Putting this expense performance together with our gross margin expansion, pre-tax margin was up 50 basis points.
Looking at operating tax, at the beginning of 2018, we provided a range for our full year tax rate of 16% plus or minus two points and that was without discrete items. With our final geographic and product mix, the full year rate without discretes was about 15%, within the expected range. Including the discrete items in the first and third quarters, our full year operating tax rate was 8%, which is a headwind year-to-year. The resulting tax rate in the fourth quarter was 12%, which is up about six points year-to-year.
Regarding our GAAP tax rate, you saw in our press release that our fourth quarter rate also reflects a charge for a GILTI tax election, associated with the implementation of 2017 U.S. tax reform. This charge impacts GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share.
And so, turning back to our operating results, operating earnings per share of $4.87 was driven by solid operating leverage, offset by an expected headwind from tax.
Looking at our cash metrics, we generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter with $11.9 billion for the year, in line with our expectations. Our realization of GAAP net income is 111% for the year, normalizing for the non-operating tax reform charge. This supports a high level of investment and shareholder returns. So now let me move on to the segments.
Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2%, with 3% growth in Solutions Software and 1% growth in Transaction Processing Software. We expanded pre-tax margin by nearly three points, delivering operating leverage on this revenue growth, from both operational efficiencies and mix, while still investing at high levels.
In the quarter, we continued to deliver innovation to our clients and scale our platforms and solutions, resulting in growth in our transactional revenue and SaaS signings. In Transaction Processing Software, we capitalized on the strong pipeline of larger transactions we discussed entering the fourth quarter, driven by our clients’ buying cycles. Our fourth quarter performance reflects these clients’ commitment to our platform for the longer term, given the value we provide in managing their mission-critical workloads and predictability in their spending.
In Solutions Software, growth was led by analytics and AI offerings, with several other high-value areas growing as well. In our underlying analytics platform, we had broad-based growth across our Db2 portfolio including analytics appliances, and Data Science offerings.
Demand for our IBM Cloud Private for Data offering accelerated, and now over 100 clients have adopted the platform, and that’s since launching just over six months ago. New clients include the Korea Internet and Security Agency, which is developing an app on ICP for Data that leverages a variety of data sources and machine learning models to find and thwart new cyber threats.
In addition, we’re scaling our newest Watson services running on IBM Cloud Private for Data, like AI OpenScale. In Security, we continued to have solid demand for our integrated security and services solutions, including strong growth in our security intelligence and orchestration offerings, QRadar and Resilient. Within our industry verticals, Watson Health had growth across Payer, Provider, Imaging and Government and IoT once again had strong growth in our core offerings, Maximo and Tririga, where we lead the market in asset management and facilities management.
In the emerging blockchain area, we announced several new clients this quarter, including our work with Smart Dubai on the Middle East’s first government-endorsed blockchain platform. We introduced an on-prem offering in November, the IBM Blockchain Platform for IBM Cloud Private, and signed several new deals this first month. We see a strong pipeline as clients are interested in the benefits of blockchain behind their firewall.
Now, over the last few quarters, I called out offerings within our Solutions Software, which address horizontal domains where we’ve faced secular shifts in the market, specifically collaboration, commerce and talent. We’ve been taking actions, and last month we announced the divestiture of our collaboration and on-prem marketing and commerce products to HCL. After closing, which is currently expected to be mid-year, this action will improve our Cognitive Solutions revenue performance, normalizing for the divested content, and reflects our commitment to disciplined portfolio management.
So now moving on to services, before getting into the two segments, I want to provide a view of the total services business. As I said earlier, revenue was up 2%, and gross margin expanded 190 basis points. Looking at our signings, on our last earnings call we talked about the strong pipeline of deals we had going into the fourth quarter. And we executed well, delivering signings of $15.8 billion, which is up 21% at constant currency.
This results in a backlog which is now $116 billion. Since it’s measured at year-end spot rates, currency is obviously impacting the backlog. But at constant currency, the backlog is down 60 basis points year-to-year, which is about a two-point improvement versus last quarter’s performance.
Customers are increasingly looking to leverage digital for growth and innovation, while at the same time increasing efficiencies and reducing cost within their businesses. IBM Services can deliver this value by leveraging its breadth across GBS and GTS. A recent example is at the Bank of the Philippine Islands, where we’ll provide IT infrastructure services as well as Digital Experience Solutions to support the bank’s ongoing digital transformation, increasing their IT efficiency and scale, and enabling them to seize opportunities in an increasingly digital financial sector.
So now turning to Global Business Services, we again, delivered solid performance, building on the momentum throughout the year. The GBS team has done a really nice job repositioning this business, and you can see it in the results. Revenue grew 6%, with growth across all business lines, and gross margin expanded 300 basis points.
Consulting revenue growth accelerated to 10%. This is validation of our success in bringing together technology and industry expertise to help our clients on their digital journey. We had continued strong growth in Digital Strategy, fueled by our Digital Commerce and CRM offerings. We are also accelerating growth in next generation Enterprise Applications led by strong demand in our consulting and implementation services in areas like S4/HANA, Salesforce, and Workday.
In Application Management, we grew 4%. This quarter we returned to growth with strong performance in cloud migration factory and cloud application development, mitigated by continued declines in traditional application management engagements, as our clients move to the cloud. The 4% growth also reflects the achievement of significant milestones across a few accounts. We’ve been also improving our revenue profile in Global Process Services.
Revenue grew 5% as we reinvent industry workflows by leveraging automation and infusing AI. And earlier this month, we announced the sale of our mortgage servicing business. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter and will result in improving revenue and margin profile, normalizing for the divested content. So, this action, like the divestiture of select software assets, is about portfolio optimization. We’re focusing on higher-value offerings that are important to our integrated value proposition.
Turning to GBS gross profit, there are a number of drivers of our 300 basis point expansion, including the operating leverage we get on the revenue growth, our mix towards higher-value offerings, and capturing the price for value, a help from currency, given our global delivery mix, and the yield on our productivity and utilization initiatives, including the re-alignment of our skills pyramids to key growth areas.
In Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we delivered $8.9 billion of revenue, which is flat versus last year, and gross margin expanded approximately 150 basis points. We continued to have strong growth in cloud revenue in the segment, this quarter up 22% year-to-year. We had a strong signings quarter, with 16 transactions over $100 million each. Both new and existing clients are looking to IBM to manage their critical infrastructure and deliver innovation, while simultaneously achieving predictable spending. We continue to see momentum in our open hybrid multi-cloud approach.
I mentioned BNP Paribas earlier. BNP Paribas has selected IBM to strengthen its cloud environment, with a hybrid multi-cloud approach, bringing together the IBM Cloud, private clouds, along with existing infrastructure. Leveraging IBM’s technical and industry expertise, BNP Paribas will accelerate its digitization to offer its clients the best services, while respecting the security and confidentiality of their data.
Looking at the revenue by line of business, Infrastructure Services revenue was flat. As we prioritize our portfolio, we are exiting some lower value content, which slightly impacts near-term revenue performance, but results in higher margins.
In Technical Support Services, revenue was down 3%. TSS continues to be impacted by the hardware product cycle dynamics, partially off-set by continued growth in our core multi-vendor services offerings. And, finally, Integration Software growth accelerated to 4%. This performance was driven by continued strong adoption of IBM Cloud Private, where we added 200 new clients. That brings our total number of clients using this innovative platform to 600 in just over a year, as they continue to modernize traditional workloads.
We also now have over 100 IBM software offerings integrated with IBM Cloud Private, including Blockchain, Watson, IoT, and Analytics. We are continuing to deliver innovation in this space, with new offerings to enable clients in an open, hybrid, multi-cloud world, like IBM Multicloud Manager which I mentioned earlier.
Turning to profit for the segment, gross margin improvement is driven by the lift of our productivity initiatives. This includes infusing AI and automation in our delivery processes, such as by leveraging IBM Services Delivery Platform with Watson, and embedding agile thinking into our service delivery processes. We’re also leveraging productivity and talent optimization efforts, where we continue to optimize business processes, reskill our expert workforce and leverage our global scale. PTI margin was flat, reflecting continued investments to expand our go-to-market capabilities and develop new offerings to capture the hybrid market opportunity.
So, to wrap up services at the beginning of 2018, we said we expected an improving trajectory in our services revenue and profit, and we delivered on that throughout the year, with a strong fourth quarter.
In systems, revenue was down 20% this quarter. I’ll remind you that this is compared to a very strong performance in the fourth quarter last year, where we grew 28%. Systems pre-tax margin was down 6.5 points, reflecting the mix headwind from the IBM Z product cycle.
I’ll walk through the different dynamics across the hardware portfolio. In IBM Z, we are six quarters into the z14 cycle. Z revenue declined 44%, while margins expanded modestly, in line with where we are in the cycle. The program continues to track ahead of the prior program, with broad client adoption across industries and countries. We continued to add new clients and new workloads to the platform. Since launching the z14 program, our MIPs capacity has increased nearly 20%, with new workload MIPs growing twice the rate of our standard MIPs.
So, we’re taking advantage of the secular shifts in the market, and now over 55% of our installed MIPs inventory is in emerging workload areas. And while there is volatility in the hardware due to product cycles, as we continue to grow our install base, up roughly 3.5 times over the last decade, this provides stability in our related software, services and financing business across IBM. Power revenue was up 10% driven by Linux and continued strong adoption across our new POWER9-based architecture.
In the fourth quarter, we completed the release of our next generation POWER9 processors in the high end, and we had strong adoption in both the low and high-end systems. Our Power9 systems are designed for handling advanced analytics, cloud environments and data-intensive workloads in AI, HANA, and UNIX markets and we now have extended HANA certification to our Power9 high end.
In the fourth quarter, we had strong initial traction with our new offerings that optimize both hardware and software for AI, such as PowerAI Vision which we introduced in the second half of 2018. And we’ve essentially completed the deployment of our supercomputers at the U.S. Department of Energy labs in the quarter.
Storage hardware was down, with declines in midrange, mitigated by continued strong growth in All Flash Arrays. The storage market remains very competitive, with ongoing pricing pressures. We’re continuing to introduce new innovations and functionality. For example, in December we extended our next generation NVMe technology into the midrange, with strong initial client adoption. We will continue to roll out NVMe across the storage portfolio in the first half of 2019.
So now turning to cash, we generated $7.3 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, excluding our financing receivables. With nearly $900 million in capital expenditures, we generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. This capped off a year with $15.6 billion of cash from operations, also excluding financing. We invested $3.7 billion in CapEx this year, mainly in our services and cloud-based businesses, and that’s up $400 million from
last year.
And so, we generated free cash flow of $11.9 billion for the year, and as I mentioned, our normalized free cash flow realization was 111%. You’ll recall that we expected our free cash flow to be about $12 billion for 2018. The year-to-year decline reflects the headwinds we anticipated from CapEx, working capital and cash taxes. We returned over $10 billion to shareholders in the year, including dividends of $5.7 billion. We’ve now increased our dividend per share for 23 consecutive years, and we remain committed to continued dividend increases. We also bought back just under 33 million shares, reducing our
average share count by over 2%. At the end of the year, we had $3.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Now looking at the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $12.2 billion, which without the impact of currency is consistent with a year ago. Total debt was $45.8 billion, down a $1 billion year-to-year, with 68% in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business is in line with the target of 9 to 1, and the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 55% investment grade, a point better than a year ago. And so, our balance sheet remains strong, and we are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating.
As we typically do at the end of the year, I want to provide a quick update on our retirement-related plans. Our U.S. plan has been frozen for over a decade, and over the last several years we’ve moved our asset base to a lower risk, lower return profile. At the end of 2018, in aggregate, our worldwide tax-qualified plans are nearly fully funded, with the U.S. at 104%, consistent with a year ago. So, despite the volatility in the markets, our plans are in really good shape.
So, let me start to wrap up with some thoughts on 2018, and then I’ll move on to expectations for 2019. As we opened the year, we talked about the work we had done to reposition our business to help move our clients to the future, shifting our portfolio, changing our operating model and the way we work, and reallocating our capital.
And in our earnings call last January, we talked about how that drove our expectations for 2018, in revenue, in margin, and in earnings per share. First, we said we expected to grow revenue at then-current spot rates. We did in fact grow revenue for the year, and that’s despite the U.S. dollar appreciation since early 2018, reducing our revenue growth by about two points, or $1.7 billion.
Second, we said we’d stabilize gross margins. While we fell a bit short for the full year, we stabilized gross margin in the third quarter, and expanded both gross and pre-tax margin in the fourth quarter and second half, that’s for the first time in over three years. We said tax would be a headwind for the year. And it was a headwind to us, for the year, and in the fourth quarter. We continued to return value to shareholders, with share repurchases contributing to earnings per share growth.
And finally, we said we expected operating earnings per share of at least $13.80 and free cash flow of about $12 billion and we achieved both of these. So, looking back on 2018, we grew revenue, operating profit and operating earnings per share for the year, with strong free cash flow realization. We had good momentum in GBS, with particular strength in consulting, led by our digital and cloud application offerings. We executed well in software in the fourth quarter, finishing the year strong, led by analytics and AI, and our hybrid cloud software.
As we execute our strategy to help our clients implement hybrid cloud, our total cloud revenue grew to over $19 billion. Across software and services, we continued to build our as-a-Service revenue, and we exited the year with a $12 billion annual run rate, which is up 21%. We continued our very successful IBM Z program and strong performance in Power, with our Power9 architecture roll-out. We repositioned our operating model and drove productivity, which improved our margin profile.
We also continued to prioritize our investments and took actions to optimize our portfolio. We announced the sale of select software and services businesses, actions that not only improve our go-forward revenue profile, but allow us to increase our focus and investment in the high value segments of IT in areas like hybrid cloud, AI, and blockchain.
All of this provides a solid business and financial foundation for the addition of Red Hat. And it gives us confidence in our expectation for full year 2019 operating earnings per share of at least $13.90. Before we go to Q&A, I want to be clear about what is, and is not included in our expectations.
As I mentioned earlier, Red Hat is expected to close in the second half, and given the financial implications to 2019 are heavily dependent on the timing of the closing, Red Hat is not included in our expectations. We’ll update our view of the year at the time of closing.
In the last month and a half, we’ve also announced two divestitures, the sale of our collaboration and on-prem marketing commerce software and the sale of our Seterus mortgage servicing business. For these businesses, when we consider the combination of the foregone profit, the gain on the sale of software assets, the actions to address structure and stranded costs and the resulting benefits from these actions, we expect there to be minimal impact to our profit and earnings per share for the year.
And unlike the Red Hat acquisition, the timing of the closing does not have a significant impact on the financial implications for the year, though it may affect the quarterly skew. As a result, our guidance assumes these divestitures. Said another way, because the divestitures are essentially neutral to our profit for 2019, they don’t impact the Operating EPS guidance for the year, though they do have a benefit to our financial profile over the longer term.
Turning to free cash flow, we expect about $12 billion in 2019, with a realization rate of about 100%. This reflects our expected operational profit performance and continued working capital efficiency, partially offset with a cash tax headwind. We have also taken into account the estimated free cash flow impacts of the software and services divestitures.
Note that while these are relatively neutral to earnings, they are a headwind to our free cash flow, because the gain proceeds flow into the investing section of our cash flow statement. Finally, while we haven’t included Red Hat, we have taken into account an estimate of the pre-closing financing costs associated with the acquisition. So, when you put it all together, we see free cash flow of about $12 billion, which is roughly flat year-to-year, even after absorbing the headwind from the portfolio actions.
And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia for the Q&A.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the full year. This includes the 2018 performance and year-end assumptions for our retirement-related plans, and supporting information on the 2019 implications of our divested businesses.
And second, as always, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So, operator, let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now start the question-and-answer session of this conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. Jim, IBM delivered a nice profit trajectory here exiting 2018. In this weaker macro backdrop, it looks like you've a pretty robust 2019 guidance. And I was hoping that you can help talk through what the profit trajectory looks like and gross and PTI level in 2019 and some color on the broader puts and takes embedded in your 2019 guide including the IP income and taxes. That would be helpful. Thank you.
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay, Wamsi. Thank you very much for the question. And it's probably a good place to start given we just concluded the prepared remarks and we talked about some of the dynamics of what's in our guidance. But as always, you would expect we run multiple scenarios here across our business and we're looking at the trajectory of our business, the macroeconomic environment, what our enterprise clients are telling us. And we also take into account our own operational indices in front of us and our business plans and strategies.
And when we put all that together this is what gives us confidence in and expectation of our operating EPS of at least $13.90 for 2019. Now, as I just stated, this guidance excludes Red Hat just given to the timing sensitivity and the financial implications I want to close as, but it includes the announced divestitures. And we'll talk about that through all these Q&As with regards to any forward-looking guidance.
But we enter – from my perspective, we enter 2019 with a much improved business profile in terms of one driving operating leverage and you saw how that played out in the second half. And it's right to the core of your question. And two, I mean, our strategic imperatives right now, the high value emerging segments in the IT industry are now consistently over 50% of IBM's business.
So we don't give guidance on revenue. Let me give you a little color behind that and then I'll go to operating leverage and gross and pretax margin and tax, as we move forward. But first I'll start with a tailwind. We have a solid annuity base in our business, today it's about 60% of IBM and that builds resiliency into our model.
And we got good momentum in our as-a-Service as you heard. We exited the year with an annualized exit run rate of $12.2 billion and that's up 21% year-over-year. You combine that with the strength within our services business, we accelerated throughout the year and we exited the year with a very strong performance by GBS team who is just doing excellent with regards to continuing to win in front of the marketplace and deliver value to their clients.
And we also captured significant signings in the fourth quarter that positions our GTS business, and really instantiates our value around hybrid cloud and how we're winning. And then you couple that with solid execution on software. We talked 90 days ago about where we were at in the third quarter around software and we made some forward-looking projections and we turned our software business around to growth growing 2% in the fourth quarter, and we have a strong portfolio lineup so we would expect that to continue.
And in hardware, yes, we’re on the back end of our mainframe cycle. And I would tell you it's the most successful mainframe we’ve had in quite a bit of time. But we continue to bring new innovation to market to deliver value for our clients in our POWER9 architecture, which is resonating well in the marketplace and we got great acceptance, grew 10% in the fourth quarter. We expect that will continue to play out in 2019. So we've got a good book of business here and some tailwinds at us.
And from a headwind perspective, you talked about macro. Well, the first thing I would call out is currency. The U.S. dollar continues to strengthen throughout 2018. Especially even since our last earnings call 90 days ago, the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate. And right now you saw in the supplemental charts we provide you with transparency, we expect about a one to two point headwind on currency. And then finally, we are taking very disciplined portfolio actions across our business where they don't align to our integrated value play and where we can reprioritize and focus our investment to drive the value around the IBM company that divested contents is going to be about a one point headwind.
So when you put it all together, we've got some pluses and minuses at the top line. But really, this year, in 2019, it's going to be predicated on operating leverage. We made good progress through 2018 and it positions us very well into expand margins in 2019. So amongst all of our scenarios, our guidance model and our expectations indicate that we will expand gross and pre-tax operating margin in 2019 as we continue to deliver value. And that's going to come out of scale efficiencies, that's going to come out of our services momentum and the mixed shift and productivity, which will offset – more than offset the product cycle mix, we still have in the divested content.
And one last thing that I would call out is tax. We're guiding to an all-in rate of about 11% to 12%, which by the way is a headwind year-to-year that we're going to have to overcome, a finishing with a printed rate of about 8% in 2018. Now this rate assumes estimated potential discretes. This is a change we're doing this to provide enhanced transparency into our guidance as we move forward. But I will tell you discretes by nature, vary in timing. They vary in amounts and will be recorded when they occur in 2019.
But you put all that together, we've got headwinds and tailwinds on revenue, strong portfolio line-up in our high value services and software. We got expanding operating leverage that we expect, the tax rate all-in of about 11% or 12%. This gives us confidence in our full year EPS of at least $13.90 and a free cash flow of about $12 billion.
Patricia Murphy
Great. Thanks. Thanks Wamsi. Can we go to the question, please?
Operator
Here our next question is coming from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Your line is open.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes. Thank you. And thank you for the clarification on the previous question. I just wanted to know if you could clarify what the size of the expected gain is on the sale of assets to Red Hat, excuse me to HCL. And then whether you expect directionally Red Hat to be accretive or dilutive to free cash flow and EPS this year?
And then on software, could you comment on the strength that you saw, was it a push out? Do you feel like you captured large enterprise license agreements or is this sort of a more normalized book? And should we expect cognitive to grow in Q1 and Q2 at a similar pace to what we saw in Q4? Thank you.
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay, Toni. Thank you very much. Very good questions. Let me try to take each of these piece by piece. First of all as you saw from our last earnings, we continue to take disciplined portfolio prioritization efforts around – our portfolio both in terms of an announcement of the acquisition of Red Hat and also the announcement of sale of certain assets within our cognitive and GBS business.
Red Hat, as we talked about, expected was – we're working through regulatory right now. We expect to close that in the second half. But with regards to your specific question on divestitures, we included in our guidance the sale of our collaboration in non-prem marketing and commerce business and the sale of our Seterus mortgaging business.
Both of these will drive headwinds as you can imagine in revenue for the year. We expect the mortgage business to close later in the first quarter. That will be a headwind this year to GBS revenue. But on a sustainable basis, this improves both our revenue profile in GBS and our margin profile as we continue to shift the higher value as we move forward.
In terms of our Cognitive assets that we sold, with regards to collaboration in non-prem, those businesses generated roughly a little bit over $1 billion of revenue over the last 12 months. We said we expected to close that by mid-year. The transaction price was $1.8 billion, but the expected gain, I will tell you, will be a lot less than that $1.8 billion as we're working through the acquisition accounting right now with regards to goodwill and how much goodwill will be applied to that. But we still expect a sizable gain, nowhere near $1.8 billion, but a sizeable gain.
And as we said, we've got to overcome; one, the foregone profit of these businesses, the stranded cost of these businesses, and we will take that gain and as you would expect, we're going to utilize a portion of that gain to address that stranded costs and structure and we’ll get return on that.
All of that put together is minimal impact to our profit. So we included that in our guidance. It has minimal impact to our profit and EPS, but it does have an impact to free cash flow. Just given what I said a little while ago in the prepared remarks, on the gain, on the asset sale, we’ll end up in the investing section, our free cash flow. So we've overcome that and still guided our free cash flow, that's roughly flat at about $12 billion.
Now your second question was on Cognitive. We obviously executed well. You dial back 90 days ago and we had some pretty frank discussions about our portfolio, how we had confidence in our portfolio, the competitiveness and the value we bring to clients. And we didn't execute in third quarter and we came back, we executed on strong pipelines.
Software was up 2% overall. Our transact – we had strong transactional performance. But probably what I'm most proud about is it was pervasive. We grew in hybrid cloud integration software 4%, we grew in solutions software 3% across many of our offerings led by data and AI and analytics, also in many offerings in our industry verticals around Watson Health, and we grew in transaction processing software, which we said that business’s mission-critical, high value to our clients and a foul client-buying cycles.
So if anything in our overall portfolio software that’s tied to skew, it’s really the transaction processing software business, where we close strong pipeline, which we talked about 90 days ago. So we feel very good about the competitiveness and value of our portfolio. We’re going to feel even better when we close the Red Hat acquisition, and what that does to provide us an acceleration in a leadership position on a hybrid multi-cloud and we’re excited and looking forward to that.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tony. And can we please go to the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Katy Huberty
Thank you. Good afternoon. Congrats on the nice numbers in the fourth quarter. Question around linearity in 2019, there’s a lot going on with tax, grade, divestiture, another Red Hat numbers are in the guidance yet. But how should we think about linearity given that the timing of some of these discrete items may change the walkthrough in the year?
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay. Thank you, Katy. And thanks on behalf of the entire IBM team, really just deliver the solid fourth quarter here. But if you take a look at, it’s very good question. Why don’t I just address it by trying to get some visibility into first quarter? It’s right in front of us right now. If you take a look at first quarter again, we guided full year EPS of at least $13.90. If you look at first quarter, first of all, on an EPS perspective, we would expect the operating EPS skew to be around 16% of the full year $13.90.
So when you take a look at that, it gets us off to a good start. It does acknowledge that we are on the back end of a mainframe product cycle, but we got acceleration in our services and our software base of business. And we feel confident in at least that 16% starting out the year. Now, if you look at that compared to the last three years, it will show that it’s a little bit less attainment.
But to your – heart of your question, the last few years we had substantial discrete tax items in the first quarter. If you go back to 16%, we closed on the Japan audit. If you go back to last year, we closed on the U.S. audit settlement. We do not see anywhere near the level of discretes in the first quarter. And I would project somewhere around 11%, 10%. There might be something within the first quarter, but we’re not talking substantial amount.
So that is really EPS. On revenue, which we probably have the best visibility just given our operational indices, the mixed differential of our revenue base between annuity and transactional, when we move from a fourth quarter and the first quarter. That seasonality, the transactional businesses have a more muted effect on 1Q versus 4Q. And as the mix of more annuity content, which plays out in the first quarter, this should contribute about a 1 to 2 point sequential improvement and our growth at constant currency. We just came off our fourth quarter with many different dynamics that produce a down 1 at constant currency.
So we do see an improvement just given the mixed shift in the strength of our annuity content as we move forward. The last thing that I’ll bring up about first quarter is, I talked a little bit about currency for the year, we have our toughest compare on currency in the first quarter, just given last year the dollar weakened throughout the first quarter and then dramatically accelerated or strengthen as we move through 2Q to 4Q.
So as you saw in the supplemental chart, our currency impact is going to be a 3 to 4 point headwind and based on what I looked that were dollar closed late today, it’s going to be probably closer to that 4 point headwind overall.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thanks, Katy. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Tien-tsin Huang
Thanks. I want to ask on services that improved, like you said, it would in 2018. I’m curious, your outlook is for 2019 within services, because there are some moving parts GBS is perform really well application management up into a nice place, so curious on a sustainability there. Just as a clarification away from the services, what strategic imperatives of 9%, there wasn’t as much talk about that in the prepared remarks. I’m curious, that still going to be a metric that’s going to be provided or attract going forward. Thanks.
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay, Tien-tsin. Thank you very much for the question. We obviously are very pleased with our services business and how we’ve continued to reposition our portfolio both in GBS, but also in our GTS space of business as we move throughout 2018. But when you look at the trajectory of our business, we ended the year with an overall are absolute backlog of $116 billion, that’s down 60 basis points at constant currency and it’s a big improvement from where we started a year ago. If you remember our discussions here a year ago, we had a lot of discussion about your overall backlog is down 3% at constant currency and we talked a lot about what we saw play out in 2018 and the team’s just done an excellent job. We’re in a much better position. And we do see across our total services business in 2019 sustained revenue growth and margin profile.
Well, let me take the pieces and just give you a little bit of perspective. GBS, I couldn’t be more proud of the team about what they’ve done to reposition their portfolio and their offerings in capturing, in delivering growth to our clients, in digital, in cognitive and cloud. You saw in the fourth quarter, we exited GBS, I’ll get these numbers pretty close. Strategic imperatives growing mid-teens, cloud growing 30%-plus and our as-a-Service based business, exiting would over a $2 billion number, I think up 64% overall.
And we’ve got pervasive growth across all three lines of business led by digital. We did state an application management, where we finally returned back to growth in the fourth quarter. We are executing and delivering value and driving cloud migration services and cloud application development. We have a differentiated offering and we’re delivering value to our clients, but we also closed on many client specific milestones that caught up in the fourth quarter, but we still see good growth. It’s just not going to be at the level that you saw here in the fourth quarter.
With all that said, our margin and operating leverage, we feel comfortable. We grew GBS operating gross margins 300 basis points in the fourth quarter. That will dissipate throughout 2019, but we still see strong operating leverage led by our mix shift to higher value in the offerings, how we’re capturing that price realization and how we’re delivering real value and quality to our clients.
Now in GTS, we are obviously winning with our hybrid cloud momentum. We had a strong signings quarter, really led by GTS overall in the hybrid cloud value prop, delivered $15.8 billion of signings, up 21% that’s what improved their backlog position here at the end of the year, and we’re exiting with $8 billion as-a-Service annualized exit run rate which provides a strong annuity based content and resiliency in our model.
Now with that said, we are doing portfolio prioritization in GTS. We are constantly going to focus on where we can exploit and deliver value to our client and also make high value returns for the IBM shareholder. We are walking away from low value based content in GTS, you saw that in the fourth quarter where our GTS business overall was down I think, 50, 70 basis points.
And while you see that back – absolute backlog improve, we are going to continue prioritizing high value because we want to get prioritization of cash, profit and margin out of that business and leverage that business in the value of incumbency and moving our clients to the future in capitalizing on hybrid cloud.
So we’ll see continued margin expansion in GTS as we move forward and that’s going to come out of very similar scale efficiencies, productivity. And remember in both, we’re still going to get the second half of our productivity from our 2018 actions. So we feel pretty comfortable and confident in our services base of business as we walk into 2019.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tien-tsin. Can we go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.
David Grossman
Thank you. So Jim, you’ve announced two divestitures in the last six weeks, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you are exiting some GTS business that was perhaps lower margin, slower growth. Obviously, without getting too specific, what else can you tell us about the other efforts that are underway to streamline the legacy core that may positively impact the agility of the organization as well as positively impact your growth rate.
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay. David, thanks very much for the question. Let me take a big step back. Obviously I’ve been thinking about this as Jenny and everyone else. From my perspective, we constantly say IBM is a high value based company. We’re a high value to our clients. We’re high value to our shareholders. In the way we remain high value is through disciplined portfolio optimization. And whether you go over, what we just did the last 90 or 120 days or you go over the last three to five years, we have constantly focused on one, where is the market moving in terms of growth, high value offerings, client value, and most importantly profit pools. And you’re seeing us continue to do that as we move forward.
These latest actions really center around disciplined portfolio prioritization around market attractiveness, around differentiation and around how they really play to the integrated value of the IBM portfolio. Our differentiated hardware software services, and that was really at the heart of the divestitures that we just announced around certain assets in our Cognitive Solutions segment and in our global processing mortgage servicing unit, they were basically more and more sold as standalone only products and offerings that can be leveraged and delivered to our clients through a different partner, who will make the investment prioritization as we move forward.
I could tell you, we're always looking at portfolio optimization, and how we prioritize our investment and capital allocation and you see that with the announcement of Red Hat and you see that play out and what we just did with Cognitive and GBS. But as we go forward, we're going to continue to prudently managing our portfolio and operate what that financial discipline in terms of acquisitions. Our strategy hasn't changed. It's always been built around supporting high value.
And it's about built around leveraging the investment thesis and narrative of IBM innovative technology, deep industry expertise and trust and security all delivered through an integrated model of hardware, software services. And then finally, I would tell you, we have a strong balance sheet. We have great cash flow and we have enough financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business and returning value to our shareholders over the long term. So we feel pretty good.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming John Roy of UBS. Your line is open.
John Roy
Great. Thank you so much. So, well, obviously, cloud is a trend that everybody is giving off more importance here in the enterprise space and yet, you have somewhat of a flat quarter. I was curious as to when you win cloud deals as to why and how would you see the Red Hat acquisition is changing the color around why you win and how much you win?
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay, John. Thank you very much for the question. Let me try to put this in perspective around cloud. First of our cloud overall for the year, it was $19.2 billion. That was up 12%. And within that, as we always talk about the high value emerging areas of as-a-Service finished when an annualized exit run rate of $12.2 billion up 21%, which really clearly underlines our consistent execution in us capturing the high value secular shifts around cloud in that as-a-Service. Now, when you look at cloud in the quarter, the cloud number as printed really reflects the same fundamental headwind on the wrap of the product cycle or mainframe that we had to overcome.
Now that isn't new, we expected that. We've been talking about that all year long. Second half of the year, we knew we were going to be on the backend of our mainframe product cycle. Remember we came off a mainframe that grew 71% in the fourth quarter of 2017. And this is as I said before, the most successful mainframe product cycle in quite some time, which by the way generates and captures new emerging workloads around pervasive encryption, but also as capturing new workloads around cloud as we move forward.
So that cloud business without mainframe was actually up 19%. That's an acceleration underlying our software acceleration from 3Q to 4Q underlining our services acceleration from 3Q to 4Q and we see that as we move forward because remember, although we had a deal with the largest transactional quarter on mainframe, albeit in 2019, that starts to dissipate because we're through that biggest volume based quarter.
So we see cloud still resonating with our clients into your heart of your question about Red Hat, Red Hat and IBM together we see this movement of how we can deliver value in leading the second phase, Ginni calls this chapter two, the second phase around where clients are moving, very business critical business value lead workloads and that's about 80% of the workloads ahead of us.
So the value of bringing IBM and Red Hat together is going to be centered around hybrid open multicloud and us wrapping around our security, secure to the core and how we're going to deliver that differentiated value proposition. And we're just excited about what Red Hat is going to mean to the IBM company and our clients.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks John. And can we please take the next question?
Operator
Next question is coming from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jim Schneider
Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, it's good to see the improvement in software and cognitive relative last quarter. I guess the question is on a go forward basis or you have a target of mid-single-digit growth long-term in cognitive, is it realistic to expect that you could achieve that, as we head throughout 2019 and maybe talk about the impact of any of the transactional business you may have seen this quarter that might affect that, and just kind of talk broadly about the macro environment for that product fit in general?
Jim Kavanaugh
Yes. Jim, thanks very much for the question overall. We are pleased with our software performance exiting the year. As I talked about, I think it's really an instantiation that demonstrates our ability to deliver innovative solutions embedded with AI, that drives business value to our clients really through an industry lens that plays across the integrated value of IBM. What are services base of business in stacked on top of our hardware based platforms, but when you look at fourth quarter, we exited 2% growth.
We had good pervasive growth across the portfolio, as I said before, good, strong transactional growth, good SaaS signings, high renewal rates, and remember this cognitive solution segment is high value, high operating margins, and we continue to expand operating margins here in the fourth quarter and for the full year.
Now when you take a step back, U.S. long-term, well obviously in 2019 we're going to deal with the headwind I talked about what the domestic content, that will to cognitive solutions probably be, on a trailing 12 months we did a over a little over $1 billion. It'll be about a four, five point headwind in 2019 and that's pre Red Hat acquisition because Red Hat’s not in 2019 yet. But we're going to have right off the bat of four to five point headwind.
But the underlying fundamentals in our long-term sustainability around that. Yes, our long-term model has not changed. We still see the strength of our offering portfolio, one, even getting better around our hybrid integration software, two around our analytics portfolio, which just had a great quarter, a data AI, our industry based verticals our Watson Health had growth across many of its offerings as I talked about earlier.
And even in IoT we had growth around our core franchises, our facilities management and asset management, Maximo, Tririga. So we got a good, good lineup. It's going to be on us to execute here in 20 – 2019. We fully expect to do that.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Jim. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is coming from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Joseph Foresi
Hi, it sounded like in your remarks earlier that you thought you could deliver sustainable organic constant currency growth in 2019. And so does that include or exclude Red Hat and then just as importantly, maybe you can give us some color around first half margins versus second half margins and maybe what the margin exit rate will be for 2019? Thanks.
Jim Kavanaugh
Sure, Joe, thank you very much for the call. First of all, we don’t guide on revenue for the year. So, I don’t remember stating that we are going to grow the year at constant currency organically et cetera. Red Hat is not in any of the guidance as we talked about upfront. We do have the divestitures in here and divestitures are going to be about a point headwind as we move forward and as I stated, currency is going to be a one or two point headwind at actual rates. But we do feel confident in the book of business we have around our services and around our software as we move forward. But the underlying dynamics as I talked about, we got many different scenarios we’re running here.
All the point to given us confidence in our expectation of at least $13.90 as we move forward. That is going to be a mixture of the mix of our portfolio, the revenue of our portfolio, the operating leverage of our portfolio, the tax structure IP, there are many different variables that go into that $13.90 overall.
We do see strong operating leverage continuing in 2019; both gross and pretax margin leveraging our scale efficiencies, leveraging our mixed shift, the higher value, leveraging our productivity initiatives.
And when you look at it, we’ve got great momentum exiting second half in particular on our services base of business. Second half services grew operating gross margins by 200 basis points. And I think you would expect a similar first half trend around that and in second half, we’ll start wrapping on a little bit tougher compares, but for the first, excuse me, for the full year, we would expect good operating leverage and that’s what we’re guiding to.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Joe. Let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open.
Jim Suva
Thank you very much. In your prepared slides, Slide number 10, it was very informative to help us bridge the two different years on our earnings. The question I have is, as we look forward to next year I know you have a lot of variables, are there any bridge items that you want to particularly call us out for most likely to happen to hit your $13.90, and how come cash flow wouldn’t be growing if your earnings growing? Thank you.
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay, Jim. First of all, thank you for the question. Thanks for the compliment. Team does work very hard that you provide the right level of transparency. So our investors can understand the operating dynamics of our business. Chart 10 lays out that full year. You see how 2018 played out, strong operating leverage, tax headwind, revenue growth at actuals when you look at it and you go back to beginning of January last year, we stated what we saw for the year. We grew revenue. We grew operating leverage. We grew operating pretax income. We grew earnings per share and that played out well. If you look at 2019, as I stated many different scenarios, but what have we talked about already on this call?
One, we see continued operating leverage coming out of gross and pretax margin in 2019. Two, we do see tax being a headwind to us in 2019 and again, we tried to provide enhanced transparency, where we’re giving you an all in rate of at least 11% to 12%, but even with that, that’s a three to four point headwind. We’ll continue to buy back shares as we talked about.
I think that’s one level of confidence and we have in the long-term value of IBM, but it’s also a level of confidence that we have in the power of the IBM and Red Hat acquisition. So, I think you could see that continuing to play out. And then I guess last, we talked about currency on revenue; currency on revenue, the impact of one or two points and the divestiture. So, we will continue showing the transparency of the CPS bridge, helps our investors understand the operating dynamics as we move forward.
Patricia Murphy
And then jim, on your question on cash, as jim said in the prepared remarks, we obviously have a headwind from the divested businesses, because we have the forgone – we’ll have forgone profit and we’ll have a gain, but the gain doesn’t go into free cash flow. We also will have some items that hit our free cash flow relative to some pre-closing costs for Red Hat. So, that’s the reason that our free cash flow is flat despite the fact that we have a couple of headwinds within them. So, operator, why don’t we take one last question.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question in queue is coming from Keith Bachman of BMO. Your line is open.
Keith Bachman
Hi, thank you. Jim, just a clarification first then a question on the clarification, you mentioned the impact of the divestitures. And the slide that indicates the impact is $1.5 billion, I think you said $1 billion was coming out of cognitive and I just wanted to see if you just clarify, where is the rest coming out of?
And then the question is on technology services and cloud platforms. I wanted to get your perspective as you look at 2019; this business continues to trail a little bit relative to GBS in terms of revenue performance. Would you expect or anticipate this business to grow and CY19? And therefore, would you expect operating leverage to also be demonstrated in this business? Thank you.
Jim Kavanaugh
Yes. Thanks keith for the question overall. First of all, on your clarification, the impact of divestitures, we actually did provide a supplemental chart that hopefully each of you and our investors will appreciate on the transparency and the implications both on 2019 and then directionally on 2019. I think, I said a little over $1 billion, if you look at Chart 15 in the supplementals, the cognitive software assets of divesting collaboration and our on-prem marketing and commerce was about a $1.3 billion.
So that’s what I meant about a little over $1 billion. When you take a look at the GBS mortgage servicing divesture that’s about $200 million, so on a full year basis annualized it’s about $1.5 billion between the two of them. So hopefully that answers the clarification.
And then on your second question, TS and CP, we finished the year with strong signings growth, which really instantiates our hybrid cloud value proposition and also the value of incumbency that we provide with our clients of understanding their workloads, understanding their business processes, and enabling us to move them to the future and capturing that cloud backlog. In fact cloud backlog is up over 5 points year-to-year as a percent of our total outsourcing backlog.
But as I said earlier, GTS business, we are going to manage this business for profit, for cash and for leveraging our incumbency to move our clients in the future and provide better client value and delight them through loyalty as they move forward. And we are going to exit some low value content business. So for 2019, I would expect pretty similar performance in GTS overall on a top line, but in margin we are going to expand margin that’s in our expectations and you see that play out in the second half of 2018 and we expect that to continue.
So, all right, with that said, apologize for going a little bit long here, we wanted to get a lot in here, one about the quarter but two about wrapping up the year and what it means for 2019, so a few comments to wrap up.
We’re entering 2019 in a great position to help our clients whether they’re looking for innovation or productivity or both. We’ve got a solid base of business. You see this in our software and services results with strategic imperatives now consistently at about half of our revenue. And an operating leverage we’re driving and we expect that to continue. This gives us confidence in our expectation of at least $13.90 of earnings per share for the year and our hand-rolling gets stronger with the addition of Red Hat, which positions us as the leader in hybrid multi-cloud world.
So thanks for joining us today. We look forward to continuing the dialogue over the course of the year. Thank you very much.
Patricia Murphy

Jim Kavanaugh
Thanks, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us.
In the third quarter, we delivered $18.8 billion of revenue, $3.6 billion of operating pretax income and $3.42 of operating earnings per share. And over the last 12 months, we generated $12.2 billion of free cash flow with realization over 100%. As compared to last year, our revenue was flat at constant currency though down 2% with the impact of the stronger dollar. Gross profit margin was flat, which is the best year-to-year performance in years. The improvement was led by services margin expansion. We expanded our overall operating pretax margin and we grew operating profit and earnings per share.
We continue to see strong client demand in the emerging, high-value segments of the IT industry. And our performance this quarter was driven by the offerings in hybrid cloud, in security, in digital, and in analytics and AI, a testament to our ability to deliver differentiated value to our clients through innovative technologies with the skills and expertise to implement these technologies. We see the results in our strategic imperatives revenue growth of 13% over the last 12 months. We also see this playing out in higher operating margin over the last few quarters, which supports both, our long-term investment and return to shareholders. With our success in these higher value areas and our focus on delivering consistent operational performance, we remain on track to our full-year expectations of earnings per share and free cash flow.
Coming into the second half, we said we expected to improve our services revenue trajectory and to expand total services margins for the half. We also said we face some headwinds as we wrap on the new mainframe launch and our strongest software performance in the third quarter of last year.
And so now this quarter, we delivered revenue growth and gross margin expansion in both services segments. In global business services, our revenue growth accelerated, driven by consulting as we help clients with their digital transformations. And we grew revenue again in Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, driven by hybrid cloud implementations. And I should mention that my revenue comments here and throughout will be based on constant currency.
In systems, our IBM Z revenue grew, despite a wrap on new mainframe launch, resulting in what is now the most successful Z program in our history. And then, looking at our software revenue, which spans our segments, we had growth in integration software, driven by offerings that help clients modernize applications and enable hybrid cloud adoption. In solution software, we had good performance in several areas including security, key offerings and analytics like data science, and our Watson health verticals, as we embed AI into more of our offerings. At the same time, we continue to deal with challenges in a few horizontal solution areas and a tougher compare in transaction processing software, both of which impacted overall software revenue growth.
Across our segments, our strategic imperatives revenue has grown to $39.5 billion over the last 12 months. Within that, our cloud revenue is $19 billion, and we exited the third quarter within as-a-service annual run rate of $11.4 billion, which again was up 24%. While that’s already a significant revenue base in the emerging, high-value segments of the IT industry such as cloud and AI, it’s still early in the adoption of these technologies.
For example, it’s estimated that enterprises are only 10% to 20% into their cloud journey, with progress slow by the lack of interoperability across cloud environments and concerns about the ability to manage data privacy and security in multiple cloud environments. And so, clients need a cloud partner that can offer a hybrid cloud for workloads that cut across public, private and traditional, a secure cloud for mission-critical workloads and highly sensitive data and an open cloud to run complex, multi-cloud environments.
12 months ago, we launched IBM Cloud Private, which is a starting point for many companies as they embrace a hybrid, multi-cloud strategy. Already, more than 400 global companies have embraced this platform to manage mission-critical business processes in the cloud, and nearly all of these are competitive wins. Just yesterday, we announced a series of innovations that will help clients scale their cloud, AI and cyber security initiatives. These include IBM Multicloud Manager, which is the industry’s first service to deploy and manage complete applications in any cloud environment. We also announced IBM’s AI OpenScale technology, the first open, interoperable AI platform to manage the lifecycle of all forms of AI applications and models. This includes the management of bias, security and provenance of models and data which are the issues clients are facing with scaling AI in the enterprise.
These are just a few examples of how we’re building our technology innovations and industry expertise with trust and security to help enterprises on their journey to cloud and to AI.
Before getting into the financial metrics, I’ll lay out the drivers of our operating earnings per share growth. As I said, our revenue is flat at constant currency, but with the continued strengthening of the dollar, revenue was down 2%. And at constant margin, this was a headwind to profit and earnings per share growth. Our actions to reposition our cost base and drive operating efficiencies resulted in pretax margin expansion of 50 basis points, despite a headwind from mix. And so, we had modest growth in our pretax income. Our tax rate was down, driven by a discrete benefit in the quarter, and finally, a lower share count contributed to growth. Putting it all together, our operating EPS was up 5%. Year-to-date through September, our operating EPS is also up 5%. And you can see on this chart the contributors to earnings per share growth consistent with how we presented it over the last three quarters.
Looking at our underlying profit and cash metrics. As I said, our gross margin was flat compared to last year, which is an improvement in the year-to-year trajectory. We had solid gross margin improvement in the services segments, together up 160 basis points. And as I talked about last quarter, in services, which is a human capital based business, value is instantiated in gross margin. This was offset by the mix headwinds we discussed 90 days ago, in z14 mainframe and software.
Our operating expense was down 4% year-to-year with half due to currency and half due to the base operational performance. When currency hurts the top-line, it generally helps the expense line due to both translation and the benefit of hedging contracts. The base expense reduction of 2 points was driven by operating efficiencies, including acquisition synergies. We deliver productivity across our business by using automation, leveraging agile processes and changing the way we work. This provides flexibility to increase investment to deliver innovations in areas like hybrid cloud, AI, cyber security and blockchain, while also dropping some to the bottom line.
Within our expense decline, we also absorbed a lower level of IP income. We expanded both operating pretax and net income margins, and net income was up 3%. Our operating tax rate was down 2 points from last year, while our underline rate of 16% is up slightly. As I said the year-to-year dynamic is driven by discrete benefit in the quarter.
Looking at our cash metrics. We generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.4 billion through September, which is year-to-year. As expected, our year-to-date decline is driven by cash tax headwind and growth in CapEx. As always, trailing 12 months is the best way to look at our cash flow performance. And on that basis, we generated $12.2 billion, which a 108% free cash flow realization. We returned about 70% of that to shareholders while increasing our capital investment.
Turning to our segments. Cognitive solutions had $4.1 billion of revenue, which was down 5%. The segment is comprised of a broad set of offerings. So, let me take a minute to break it down. solutions software includes offerings and strategic verticals like health, domain-specific capabilities, like analytics and security, as well as our emerging technologies of AI and blockchain. We had good performance across these areas this quarter, and I’ll come back to these in a minute.
Solutions also includes offerings that address horizontal domains. And over the last three quarters, I’ve been talking about challenges in a few of these areas, specifically collaboration, commerce and talent where we’re dealing with secular shifts in the market. We’ve been taking actions including modernizing our offerings, infusing AI, and enhancing the digital experience. While these three areas continue to weigh on the segment’s overall performance, we’ve made some progress. For example, in commerce, where we infused AI into offerings like customer experience analytics, SaaS signings grew double digits this quarter. And in collaboration, we’ve had very positive reaction to the recent introduction of Notes/Domino Version 10, which is optimized for mobile and supports JavaScript and Node.js. So, we’re starting to see some green shoots. But because the time to value is longer in SaaS, we will start seeing this play out as we get into 2019.
Cognitive Solutions also includes transaction processing software. This includes software that runs mission-critical workloads, leveraging our hardware platforms. While much of the revenue is annuity-based, in any quarter, the performance reflects the timing of larger transactions that are tied to client buying cycles. We have a good pipeline in transaction processing software as we enter the fourth quarter, which supports a return to growth.
So, now, let me turn back to a few of our high-value areas where we continue to scale new platforms and high-value solutions. This quarter, we had growth in industry verticals like health, key areas of analytics and security. In Watson health, where we’ve been infusing AI the longest, we had broad-based growth including in payer, provider, imaging and life sciences. In the area of life sciences, we’ve been working with Medtronic to leverage data and apply intelligence into their glucose monitors. In June, the Sugar.IQ with Medtronic went live, and initial demand and patient results are very strong.
In our underlying analytics platform, we had growth in our data science and IBM Cloud Private for data offerings. We continue to invest in advancing data and AI. We announced bias detection services and introduced new Watson services on the IBM Cloud Private platform as clients seek the benefits of AI and the cloud behind their firewall.
Security growth in the quarter was led by offerings in orchestration, data security and endpoint management. Our momentum is driven by our unique market position, comprehensive integrated portfolio and differentiation with AI. In the emerging area of blockchain, this quarter our IBM Food Trust network for food safety went live, and Carrefour, one of the world’s leading retailers joined the network. We also jointly announced TradeLens with Maersk. Together we will apply blockchain technologies to address inefficiencies in the global supply chain, and signed up over 50 ecosystem participants, and we now have over 75 active blockchain networks.
Looking at profit this quarter. We expanded pre-tax margin by over a point year-to-year. This was driven by operational efficiencies, including acquisition synergies, while continuing to invest at high levels in key strategic areas.
Looking at services. Our global business services revenue grew 3%, building on the progress from first half. Consulting revenue growth accelerated to 7%, led by strength in offerings within the Digital Strategy and iX, as well as Cognitive Process Transformation. And in application management, a decline in traditional enterprise application managed services is being mitigated by the continued strength in areas such as cloud migration factory and cloud application development.
Our consulting performance reflects the fact that enterprises are undergoing a digital transformation and reinvention, leveraging technology to transform the way they operate, to attract the best talent, and to improve engagements with their customers.
Customers are turning to GBS as we are uniquely positioned to infuse IBM’s leading-edge technology and partnerships with our industry expertise to enable clients’ digital transformation. For example, we are partnering with Sally Beauty to provide it innovative digital and in-store customer experience, influenced by deep understanding of the brand, consumer, and retail industry. We are creating virtual assistance for Lloyds Banking Group to enhance the way they communicate with and serve customers. And at the U.S. Open, GBS provided the digital fan experience, which included several innovative features. AI highlights enabled the tournament’s digital team to view and find the most exciting shot of the day or match for distribution, and the AI powered virtual concierges answered fans’ questions on a range of topics.
Turning to gross profit. GBS gross margin expanded 270 basis points year-to-year. We are shifting our revenue mix towards higher value offering such as digital and cognitive, and capturing that price for value. Additionally, we have aligned our resources to key skill areas and are seeing productivity and utilization benefits. Putting it all together, GBS delivered a solid quarter. They are executing well and delivering value to clients in key strategic areas.
In Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we delivered $8.3 billion of revenue and grew for the second consecutive quarter. Growth was led by hybrid cloud implementations with cloud revenue up 22%. And we exited the quarter with a $7.5 billion as-a-service annual run rate. This reflects IBM’s differentiated value proposition to address cloud for the enterprise. As I said earlier, clients are early in their cloud journey and their needs are evolving. Initial cloud projects focused on the productivity economics of renting IT infrastructure at scale.
More and more however, clients want to move beyond that model and start to shift mission-critical business processes and apps to the cloud. They recognize that cloud can help drive real business value in those processes, launch new applications rapidly and enter new markets. And this all needs to be optimized across public, private and on-prem where many of the workloads will remain. This is why IBM’s approach to cloud is hybrid, secure and open.
I mentioned our announcements yesterday. It’s important to note that we are bringing new, open and interoperable approaches to cloud. This is consistent with our heritage as a leader in open standards and governance. From the early days of Linux and Java to Kubernetes and Hyperledger for blockchain, we’re bringing the same open approach to cloud and AI, which will also help clients overcome the complexity of proprietary technology and vendor lock-in. Within this segment, we see results of this shift in infrastructure services and integration software with strong cloud performance contributing to revenue growth in both of these areas.
I mentioned earlier the strong adoption of IBM Cloud Private, with 95 new companies alone this quarter around the globe. For example, Aflac in Japan is trusting IBM Cloud to help speed the development of new business products and services. Brazil’s Fidelity National Information Services, a global leader in payment processing solutions has adopted IBM Cloud Private to help streamline credit card charge backs for its Brazilian operations. And CNH Industrial, a leader in the capital goods sector will use IBM Cloud Private and Watson Artificial Intelligence to transform its business processes across manufacturing, supply chain, sales and marketing, and financial services.
And now, turning to technical support services, revenue was down 3%, which is a modest sequential improvement from second quarter. Similar to last quarter, this area continued to be impacted by the dynamics of our hardware product cycle, moderated by continued growth in our core multi-vendor services offerings.
Moving on to gross profit for the segment. Margin expanded 120 basis points. This improvement was driven by scale efficiencies in our cloud business as well as a lift in our productivity initiatives. As we continue to drive value in Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we are making investments to capitalize on the shifts to cloud by adding capacity and expanding our data center footprint around the world as well as expanding our go-to-market capabilities to capture the opportunity in hybrid. We’re also investing in development to drive hybrid cloud innovation that means both private and public technologies. You see this in the introduction of IBM Multicloud Manager and AI OpenScale. And we’re also adding functionality and enhancements to IBM Cloud Private and IBM Cloud.
Before moving on to Systems, let me give you some perspective on our combined services business. As we entered the year, we saw improved revenue from opening backlog, which pointed to an improving revenue trajectory. And the actions we’ve been taking to remix our offerings to higher value, improve price realization and drive productivity and workforce optimization combined with scale efficiencies in the cloud are designed to improve gross profit performance, which in a human capital-based business is where the value is instantiated. In the third quarter for services, the revenue trajectory and gross margins continued to improve, with combined revenue up 1% and gross margins expanding 160 basis points.
In Systems, we grew revenue again this quarter, driven by a combination of a strong z14, a newly introduced POWER9 adoption. This quarter IBM Z revenue grew 6% year-to-year on 20% MIPs growth, and margins expanded. The z14 program continued to track ahead the prior cycle. And in fact, program to-date in terms of shipped capacity, it’s the most successful in our platform’s long history. The z14’s pervasive encryption continues to be a key differentiator. For instance, governments are selecting z14 to protect the sensitive data, including a large U.S. government agency this quarter. The z14 adoption spans many industries and countries. And we added new clients to the platform again this quarter, including several new clients to our new single-frame z14 designed specifically for cloud environments.
Our Power revenue was up double digits, driven by strong growth in Linux, and traction across our new POWER9-based architecture. In the third quarter, we released our next-generation POWER9 processors for a mid-range and a high-end systems, and we’ve seen strong adoption. These systems are designed for handling advanced analytics, cloud environments, and data intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX markets. We also introduced new offerings optimizing both hardware and software for AI. Offering such as PowerAI Vision and PowerAI Enterprise will help to drive new customer adoption. And we continued to deploy our supercomputers at U.S. Department of Energy labs in the quarter.
Storage hardware was down this quarter with declines in mid-range and high-end, mitigated by strong growth in all-flash arrays. Storage is an increasingly competitive environment with continued pricing pressures. So, to differentiate in this environment requires additional investment in innovation. We’ve been releasing new functionality like Safeguarded Copy for cybersecurity to protect critical client data from cyber attack. And we signed our first large deployment of this technology with a major bank this quarter. And our new FlashSystems with next generation NVMe technology was announced earlier this quarter. We will continue to roll out NVMe across the portfolio.
Turning to profit. Systems pretax margin was down over 6 points, reflecting a mixed headwind and lower level of IP income and ongoing investment to drive innovation across the brands.
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet in the quarter. We generated $3.1 billion of cash from operations excluding our financing receivables and $2.2 billion of free cash flow. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to $5.4 billion, which is down $800 million year-to-year. The decline is driven by a combination of higher capital expenditures and cash taxes. You’ll recall at the beginning of the year, we said we expected three headwinds to our free cash flow growth this year, higher CapEx, higher cash taxes, and our strong working capital performance at the end of last year, driven by the IBM Z introduction. The combined impact from cash taxes and capital investments is in line with what we expected at this point. So, we spent a little more in CapEx and a little less on cash taxes.
Looking at uses of cash over the last three quarters. We returned $6.6 billion to our shareholders, including $4.2 billion in dividends. And we bought back 16 million shares with $1.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization at the end of September.
Looking at the balance sheet highlights. We ended September with $14.7 billion in cash and non-financing debt of about $16.5 billion. We had just over $30 billion of debt in support of our financing business, which continues to be leveraged at 9 to 1. Our financing portfolio remained strong at 55% investment grade. That’s a point better than December and two points better than a year ago. So, I’m confident in the strength of our balance sheet. We’ve got plenty of flexibility to continue to invest, while returning value to our shareholders as evidenced by 23 consecutive years of dividend increases.
So, let me wrap it up. Our performance through the first three quarters reflects the investments we’ve been making over the last couple years and actions to reposition the business. We’ve been rebuilding our innovation pipeline to address what our enterprise clients value in an IT industry that has been rapidly reordering, technologies like AI, blockchain, cyber security delivered in hybrid cloud environments. And we’ve taken actions to further align our skill base to this opportunity and to drive operating efficiencies.
And so, now, on a year-to-date basis, our revenue is up, our gross margin trajectory has been improving, and then the third quarter was flat year-to-year. Our operating profit is up modestly and we returned a lot of value to shareholders. These all reinforce the fact that we’re a high-value company.
As we look forward as always, there’s more work to do. And the fourth quarter seasonally has a large transaction base. But with the performance in the first three quarters and our focus on consistent operational execution, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share. Regarding our free cash flow with the headwinds we expected in cash taxes and capital expenditures largely behind us, we are maintaining our view of about $12 billion of free cash flow for the year, which is over 100% realization.
And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia, so we can get started on Q&A.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I’d ask you to refrain for multiple questions and multi-part questions, so that we can make the best use of the time we have today. So, operator, let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani
Thank you. Jim, I guess, when I think about this quarter, there were multiple cross currents that IBM dealt with across the portfolio. So, I guess, it would be helpful just to hear how you would characterize IBM’s performance in September quarter versus what you guys were expecting 90 days ago, and importantly the sustainability of some of the trends that you’re seeing, especially on gross margins, which were flat on a very difficult compare I think versus last year. And then, on the other hand, you had Cognitive was down somewhat more than I thought. So, if you could maybe just characterize the performance and sustainability of some of these trends versus what you thought 90 days ago, that would be really helpful for us.
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay. Thanks, Amit. And it’s a good place to start here talking about the characterization of our quarter, now that we’re through three quarters of 2018. But, I guess from my perspective, I would say, first, we had a solid quarter. We delivered $18.8 billion of revenue, which was consistent with our guidance of a typical quarter-to-quarter seasonality, even in light of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which continues to go against us. But, the headline overall would be, we fundamentally have taken the actions to reposition our business entering 2018. And you see that play out as we enter the second half where we grew operating profit, we expanded operating pretax margins by 50 basis points, we grow EPS 5% consistent with the first half, and we continue to drive strong free cash flow realization to deliver value back to our shareholders.
Now, some of the underpinnings behind that. One, we still see strong demand in key high value segments and you see that play out in our third quarter performance, and we think that will continue moving forward. Areas like hybrid cloud where we’re winning with our hybrid cloud value proposition to the marketplace, data and AI, security, digital, all of these are instantiated in our strategic imperatives, which now from a trailing 12-month perspective were at $39.5 billion, pretty close to that $40 billion target that we put in place well over three years ago, when the IBM company had less than 25% of its portfolio in strategic imperatives; today, we’re roughly at 50%. That’s a massive transformation over a period of time. And that’s led to significant improvement in trajectory of our revenue growth overall, whereas quarter -- year-to-date, we’re up 2%.
But underneath that you see some of the areas of growth around cloud, $19 billion, growing 20%. And within that, it’s being driven by our high-value as-a-service content, driving our cloud component. That’s up now to $11.4 billion on an annualized exit run rate, growing consistently at 24%. But, if you put all that together, yes, we’re seeing the underlying fundamental shifts of our top line. We’ve done the tough work to transform our portfolio. But really, what I would call as an inflection point as we enter the second half of the year is what’s happening with our operating leverage. And you see that play out in our gross margin performance, which is the best we’ve had year-to-year in over three years.
Now, let’s talk a little bit about that, because each of you is analyst; and more importantly, as I go out and meet with many of our investors, it is a very critical signpost in a high-value-based business model. And they’ve been talking about our gross margin performance and when are we going to stabilize and how are we going to get back to expansion towards our model. And we talked about as we entered the year, we knew we had headwinds coming into the second half, predominantly around mix, mix around our successful mainframe launch but also mix is starting to hurt us from a currency perspective as we talked at length 90 days ago on how currency and the strengthening of dollars is actually hurting our product-based businesses in hardware and software where you have a disconnect between your cost base, which is in U.S. dollars versus your actual revenue of local currency. So, we knew that headwind. And now, what we’ve been able to do is we’ve been able to reposition our services base of businesses, and you see not only that we return both units back to growth, we actually delivered 160 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year. That’s the best year-over-year in our services business in over five years. And we see that continuing and we expect that to continue to accelerate as we move into fourth quarter.
So, you combine that margin with our continued enterprise productivity, and you see that we’re able to deliver strong operating pretax margins, and you couple that with our strong free cash flow which on a trailing 12 months is still in excess of $12 billion and free cash flow realization over 100%. And that gives us confidence to reaffirm our expectation of at least $13.80.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Amit. Can we please go to the next question?
Operator
Our next question is from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty
Good afternoon. Jim, I want to get your early thoughts as you think about planning for next year, in particular because you face a number of headwinds, services backlog is down, the mainframe comps get more difficult, the dollars is strong, question of what tariffs do to demand. And so, in the context of all those headwinds, can you talk about what some of the offsets are as you start to plan for 2019? Whether there is a potential to continue to grow PTI as you go into next year, even as some of these headwinds don’t? Thank you. 
Jim Kavanaugh
Sure, Katy. Thank you very much for the question. Obviously, we’ve still got a lot of work to do. We’re 16 days into a very important fourth quarter. We are focused on delivering consistent operational performance to deliver value for our clients in the marketplace and also for our shareholders. So, with that said, we’ll give updates on guidance in January. But, let me give you -- and to your point, let me give you kind of what we see as the trajectory of our business in the connotation of a headwind, tailwind as we move forward. So, let me first start with services.
You see, as we entered 2018, we talked about we had a much better position on our backlog near-term runout, and you’ve seen that play out throughout 2018. And I think that’s a combination of us taking some very bold actions about repositioning our services business and capitalizing on a differentiated services model, services practices and services value propositions to capture the growth in digital, cognitive and cloud. And we see great momentum in our GBS base of business, both on top-line and on bottom-line as we move forward.
In our GTS business, again, we continue to make progress, see acceleration in revenue through the third quarter. We are leveraging our differentiated hybrid cloud value proposition. Our clients value our incumbency. They value it because we understand their infrastructure, their workloads, and they trust us to move them to the future. And we talked about in the beginning of the year, when you look at our outsourcing backlog, we were hovering around 25% of a $90 billion outsourcing backlog. But right now, exiting third quarter, that $90 billion backlog give or take, we are now in about 32%, 35% cloud content. So, we are winning in the marketplace and our clients are choosing us to move down to the future. So, I continue to see both of our services business.
Now, with that said, we got a big fourth quarter on signings. We fell short in third quarter on signings. And as you know, signings can vary. And really, all signings are not equal. The reality is, the duration, the mix of signings and also new logo versus just extensions, all can impact overall. But, when we look at our fourth quarter, we got the strongest line-up in greater than $100 million deals lined up that we’ve got a chance to exit the year with a very strong position in our services base of business. And when I couple that with our margin leverage that we’re getting out of that business, once you get the revenue growth, you see the fundamental operating leverage, I definitely see that playing out into ‘19.
Now, on Systems, Systems as you talked about, we’re into our fifth quarter on mainframe. By the way, in terms of shipped MIPs as I said in prepared remarks, this is the most successful mainframe program that we’ve ever had. And we still grew in the third quarter, albeit mid-single-digits. Now, we know we wrap on that in the fourth quarter coming off of a 72% growth last year. But, you see the underlying innovation playing out in our Systems portfolio as we rolled out our new POWER9 architecture and we grew nicely in the third quarter by -- excuse me, 17%, if I remember correctly. And we see that continuing to play out as we rolled out mid-range and high-end late in the third quarter, we see that playing out in fourth quarter and next year also. And we’ve got also innovations coming out in our all-flash systems in storage, which is where we’re gaining share and winning in the marketplace.
So, the innovation of continually modernizing those platforms and systems, power in storage, we should see some continued growth as we move into ‘19, but we will wrap on some very tough compares to mainframe, which leads me to Cognitive. And we focused on Cognitive throughout this year. One, in the third quarter, we dealt with some enterprise client buying seasonality. And as I said earlier, that will come back in the fourth quarter, just given where clients are at in their buying cycles about committing to the platform. But, we’ve been dealing with some issues around our horizontal apps. And as I said, that’s a function of a secular shift in client value and consumption models to as-a-service. And we’ll see that play out as we get into ‘19 and throughout ‘19.
So, our focus has been on the key high-value emerging areas of Cognitive around our industry verticals and around our domains, like security, blockchain, which we see great opportunity, and we’re very pleased with that portfolio overall. So, kind of a posture around headwinds, tailwinds but we’ll give a lot more color as we get into January.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thanks, Katy. Can we please go to the next question?
Operator
Next question is from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk, Jim, a little bit about free cash flow for this year. You mentioned that it will be greater than 100% of GAAP net income this year, despite the fact that you have some headwinds in cash taxes and higher CapEx, and that number is higher than your longer term guidance of 90% to 100% realization. So, I’m wondering if you can help us understand what are the positive tailwinds that you’re seeing that are enabling free cash flow to be higher than 100% of GAAP net income? And can you explicitly comment on what your expected cash pension and retirement contributions are this year, and whether receivables factoring will benefit your free cash flow and to what extent?
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay. Toni, thank you very much. And as always, many very good questions that you bring up. But, I hope I can capture many of them. If not, Patricia can get to all of you after the call. But, first of all, let me start at the big picture. Free cash flow, as we entered 2018, we entered 2018 coming off of a very strong fourth quarter in 2017 where we drew -- we actually contributed significant working capital efficiency through the launch of our mainframe product cycle. And we said in our January call that we expected about $12 billion of free cash flow in 2018 and the drivers of that from 2017 were really going to be centered around, one, incremental cash taxes that would be a headwind to us in ‘18, and by the way, that is playing out, and all of that is behind us now as we exit the third quarter; number two, that we work on a plan on driving that strong working capital efficiency with the introduction of our mainframe as we exit the fourth quarter of 2018, and that would be a headwind; and then third, we said we were going to continue to invest in our business to capitalize on our innovation and differentiate value around our hybrid cloud. And we’ve continued to invest, actually invested more this year, because we’re seeing an accelerated growth in our proud overall. Our CapEx is up, I think year-to-date 21%. So when you put those three headwinds in play, that’s what you’re seeing play out in our free cash flows through nine months.
And by the way, we still feel comfortable and expect about $12 billion for the full-year based on any metric I look at in payment wise and our trailing 12 months is at $12.2 billion et cetera.
Now, let’s get to free cash flow realization. First of all, as you know appropriately so, we draw free cash flow realization compared to GAAP earnings and GAAP net income because we believe that’s the best way of doing realization overall. And you know within that, you’ve got not only our core operating profit but we got working capital efficiencies, you got CapEx, you got tax, you got pension, all of those can be variables in that free cash flow realization. But, if you look at the last couple of years, we’ve seen positive impact to our stated goal of at least 90% free cash flow realization, driven by working capital efficiency, it’s been driving that free cash flow above 100%; and then, also tax and pension, tax about 6 points, pension a couple of points year-over-year.
So, when you take a look at those pieces, we feel comfortable in 2018 looking at both our expectation for non-GAAP and our expectation for GAAP that we will be well north of our realization here in 2018. And I’m factoring -- I would tell you, our factoring is no different from 2018. We use that appropriately as a risk mitigation strategy, to manage credit, to manage concentration and collection risk overall. And we’ll continue to use that judiciously, but I wouldn’t see any major change in that year-over-year. 
Patricia Murphy
Great. Could we please go to the next question?
Operator
Next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. I’m sorry. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan
Thank you. Jim, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the strategic imperative performance within Cognitive including the cloud revenues and as-a-service, both of which declined versus overall strategic imperative growth. Can you maybe talk about some of the puts and takes there and some color on what do you think drove that client buying seasonality that you mentioned to a prior question? And if I could, how do you think that some of these new announcements around AI OpenScale and multi-cloud could change the trajectory for Cognitive and when? Thank you.
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay, Wamsi. Thank you very much for your questions. There is a lot there to compact into a one answer. But, let me talk about strategic imperatives first and then I’ll get into Cognitive next. But let’s put the strategic imperatives into perspective. So, as I stated on the call, trailing 12 months, $39.5 billion. We talked about three years ago, we put the signpost out there. They had $40 billion at that point in time, the IBM contribution was less than a quarter of IBM’s revenue. Now, we’re approaching 50%. We’re growing in the mid-teens, 13% I think, if I remember correctly, over the trailing 12 months. And that has lifted IBM’s overall revenue growth. As you’ve seen, year-to-date, we’re growing 2% at the IBM level. But within that strategic imperatives, our cloud business, to your point, is at $19 billion right now, up 20%. And the high-value as-a-service component underneath that is up 24%, consistent with where we’ve been in the first half of the year. And I think that’s an attestation to we are capturing the new and emerging workloads as the secular shift to as-a-service world is happening overall.
Now, when you take a look at our strategic imperatives, let’s put this in perspective, where we were 90 days ago. We knew to hit that $40 billion that we needed to be at basically mid to high-single-digit growth in the second half. And we knew similar to how we laid out our expectation for guidance that we were going to wrap around the most successful mainframe product program that we’ve had in history. So, as we entered the second half, we knew we had a focus on driving that underlying high-value as-a-service content and continue to accelerate that to offset the impacts on that mainframe wrap around on product cycle. And you see in the third quarter, our strategic imperatives basically accomplished that. We did what we expected.
So, as we look going forward then in the fourth quarter, we have to repeat what we just did in the third quarter. And the underlying acceleration in our base services businesses I talked about, the expectation as we have a great pipeline lined up for our software entering the fourth quarter based on those buying cycle seasonality that impact us in third quarter, we do expect to hit the $40 billion at the end of the year. And I’ll remind you, when we set that $40 billion target in 2015, we lost over $2 billion of revenue due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. So, you’ve seen what it’s done to transform our portfolio. It’s changed the mindset of how we run our Company, how we allocate capital and investment, and you see how that’s playing up with regard to the improved trajectory.
Now, getting to Cognitive, and I’ll just talk about Cognitive SI, because to be honest with you, it’s a simple answer. We talked about last 90, 120 days about the challenges and headwinds we’re facing with regards to our horizontal application areas of talent, collaboration, and around Watson -- excuse me, marketing and commerce. We’ve been making progress and I’ll talk a little bit about that. But those three areas are still depressing our revenue. And as you know, there are secular shift to SaaS and consumption models, they hurt our as-a-service run rate.
So, while we’ve been maintaining rounding up and down $2 billion of an as-a-service for the last couple of quarters, you’re seeing strength in areas like security in our industry verticals like healthcare and blockchain and Watson, but it’s getting depressed by those three horizontal app areas, and that will not play out until that time to value throughout 2019.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Wamsi. Let’s go to next question, please.
Operator
Next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan.
Tien-tsin Huang
Thanks. Can you guys hear me now?
Patricia Murphy
We can hear you now.
Tien-tsin Huang
Sorry about that. I don’t know what happened. Good to hear from you guys. Just want to clarify, I guess on the on the 13.80, at least 13.80, trying of better assess the at least in that comment. And what’s required or how much cushion there is on the transactional side to achieve the outlook? Because if we use 13.80, that suggests 4Q earnings looks like a little below consensus and below each of the last two fourth quarters. So, just trying to understand the at least piece at this stage. Thanks.
Jim Kavanaugh
Sure, Tien-tsin, and thank you very much for the question. I think a little bit below, when you’re doing the math. I mean, we just beat third quarter by $0.02. But, let’s put that aside right now. As always, when we take a look at our following quarter and most importantly for the year, and it’s one of the same right now, we always have multiple scenarios taking into account, one, the trajectory of our business and also the fundamentals and the operational indices that we see. And all support our expectation of the at least -- excuse me, at least $13.80 of earnings per share.
So, if you put that in perspective, how are we entering fourth quarter? Well, if you look at the fundamentals of our business profile through third quarter we’re growing revenue, we’re growing operating profit, we’re growing earnings per share consistently, and we’re still driving that strong free cash flow realization. So, kind of -- let me walk down the I&E and give you a perspective. And again, there are multiple variables here. But the way we kind of see it triangulating each of these pieces.
First on revenue. On revenue, as you’ve seen in our supplemental charts, the dollar continues to go against us and strengthen against foreign currencies. And right now on revenue, we see about a 2-point currency headwind here in the fourth quarter, pretty consistent by the way with the third quarter. But, we would expect a normal historical quarter-to-quarter seasonality probably in the range of somewhere around 3 to 5 years, I mean average seasonality of 3Q to 4Q. But putting that in perspective, year-to-date grown at 2%; and where we think fourth quarter can be, we continue to feel that we expect full year revenue at current spot rates that we will grow. And again, I’ll make the statement, we’ve been saying that throughout the year. And from the trough of the U.S. dollar to FX, we’ve lost $1.5 billion of revenue since that period of time. But, we still feel based on the fundamentals and our underlying business that we will see growth moving forward, with regards to that content.
So, now, let’s turn to margin. Margin though is where we made the most progress. It is how you instantiate value. And when you take a look at, again, 90 days ago, nothing’s different. We expected a headwind on product mix, and now we’re dealing with a headwind on currency with regards to our product based businesses. And we’re more than offsetting that with services. We delivered our best year-to-year margin performance in the third quarter, led by services up 160 basis points year-over-year. The tough work we’ve done around shifting to higher value, we’re starting to see the realization in our margin on that. The momentum that we’ve got on our hybrid cloud value proposition, we’re starting to see the scale efficiencies. And the productivity benefits are playing out as we move forward.
So, when you take a look at margin, we see our margin continue to accelerate and approaching our model here in the fourth quarter. And then, you combine that with the work we have done about fundamentally changing the way we operate this Company and our enterprise productivity. I’m talking about things like embedding agile into all of our methodologies, transforming the way we work, embedding automation, AI, becoming a cognitive enterprise. With that enterprise productivity, we see our fourth quarter operating pretax margins expanding significantly as we move forward.
So, the last thing I’ll bring up is tax. And as you know, on tax, in our third quarter our underlying rate was still 16%. We did have a discrete in the third quarter. But, if you look at our fourth quarter, we continue to expect our underlying rate to be 16% plus or minus to 2 points. And I’ll tell you when you take a look at fourth quarter, fourth quarter always has the biggest variability in tax. Go look at the fourth quarter over the last 5 to 10 years. Why is that the case? Because one, it’s our largest transactional quarter. So, the product mix and geographic mix has a major implication on our underlying rate, but also tax events typically happen in the fourth quarter. Tax closures, audit closures, statute explorations, each tends to drive variability overall. But with that said, consistent with what I’ve said all year along, we expect on a full-year basis that our tax rate all-in printed will be a headwind. So, you put all those elements together, we expect the full-year guidance of at least 13.80; and as I said earlier, about $12 billion of free cash flow.
Patricia Murphy
Excellent. Tien-tsin, thanks. Mark, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Next question is from John Roy from UBS. 
John Roy
Thanks so much. Jim, I know obviously the mainframe has done very well. Is there any chance you continue to see slower moderation as you go through or is, are we back to the regular mainframe cycles? Thank you.
Jim Kavanaugh
Thank you, John. I appreciate it, a very good question. And to be honest with you, I haven’t talked enough about mainframe because we couldn’t be more pleased with how we’ve been able to leverage our high-value innovation technology, which really is instantiated, and I would argue one of the most enduring platforms that delivers tremendous value to our clients overall. But with that said, mainframe, we had a good quarter in mainframe. It is the 5th quarter we’ve wrapped, we grew 6% on a successful z14 launch. And again, I’ll remind you, that’s of a 62% growth last year. We had double-digit growth in MIPs, 20%. And by the way, as you get to the back half of the mainframe cycle, we drive margin expansion, and that happened here in the quarter. So, again, best program ever. Against the prior cycle, we are still well in excess of that prior cycle. And I would expect us to continue to be well in excess of that prior cycle here in the fourth quarter. Although, I’ll caution you in a GA [ph] plus 5 or 6 quarter in, we typically do not grow. And again, we’re coming off of 71% growth last year on a strong launch. But, we are very pleased with the platform, the pervasive encryption, value proposition is really resonating. Now, as we get into the back half of the cycle, we drive margin expansion and now we start seeing the rest of the platform stack play out with regards to our maintenance base, our IGF base, our software base that’s on top of it.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, John. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Next question is from David Grossman from Stifel Financials. 
David Grossman
Thank you. Jim, you touched on this briefly in one or two of the questions. But, is there anything you can share beyond the quarterly data points that will help us better understand the growth trajectory of the Cognitive segment going forward? I think, I understand the issues, but they seem somewhat open ended, and really having a hard time changing how to model growth of that segment going forward?
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay. David, thank you for the question. Cognitive, so, from a net perspective, then, I’ll expand. We were impacted by enterprise client buying cycles, as I said in prepared remarks. And also challenges that we’ve talked about last quarter around our horizontal apps, in particular, talent collaboration and marketing and commerce where we’re seeing in some green shoots but again, time to value in that as you shift to SaaS, all you know quite well will play out as we get into 2019.
But, let’s take a moment and really unpack this segment. To your point and part of this, I think is on us. But, there are many different pieces of this segment. So, we have a strong portfolio of high-value areas around domains like security, analytics, blockchain. We’ve got industry verticals like healthcare, our FSS portfolio, and IoT. We’ve got horizontal apps, as I talked about, like talent, collaboration and marketing in commerce. And then we have transaction processing software. So, let me unpack this. But, I’ll remind you, this segment’s high-value, high-margin. And we continue to expand even in third quarter and third quarter year-to-date, we’re expanding our pre-tax margins overall. But let me give you the different dynamics and how they’re playing out, I’ll do it kind of headwind, tailwind.
First in terms of headwind, as you could see through the prepared remarks, we were impacted by TPS and by our horizontal apps. So, let’s talk TPS.
TPS, high value business. Strategically important to our clients. By the way, it encompasses mission-critical systems that run many industries like banking, like airlines, like retail, and there is seasonality to this business. And what you saw play out in third quarter was tied to enterprise client buying cycles that really reflect the time of when they commit to choose to go to the platform. And what we see right now, when you look at the last couple years by the way, a 2-year CGR [ph] kind of within our long-term model expectations. We had a strong growth last year, down 8% this quarter, but when we look at our fourth quarter, we actually see a very strong pipeline because we’re in the sweet spot of what that client buying cycle is here in the fourth quarter. And with that, we expect growth in this part of the portfolio here in the fourth quarter, and that will lead to much better software performance overall.
Around our horizontal apps, again, we talked 90 days ago. What did we say? We were going to strategically invest and we were going to take action, action around revitalizing our portfolio to be more digitally consumable, around investing, around high-value embedding AI and Watson to differentiate, and around actions we were going to take around portfolio simplification, and repositioning our platforms for further innovation. And we’ve made progress, I’ll tell you, in collaboration, as I said in the prepared remarks. We’ve had our biggest release ever of Notes/Domino Version 10 focused on mobile, supporting JavaScript, Node.js more open than ever, integrated with other platforms like Salesforce, ServiceNow, Watson, Weather, and we expect that to play out as we get into ‘19 with that innovative technology. And in commerce and talent, we’ve been making innovation and investments on embedding AI so we can differentiate our value proposition in the marketplace to win. And I would tell you early signs -- we got some green shoots. Our SaaS signings are growing, and in particular in commerce and in talent, collectively they are growing significant double-digit in the third quarter. So, there’s some good green shoots starting out, but again, that will play out as we get later into 2019 and we can ramp and scale.
And then, finally, I’ll wrap up on our high-value industry verticals and domain areas. We had good growth in security. We have a differentiated value proposition. We’re gaining market share. We’re the industry leader. We expect that to continue. And in health, we had strong growth in health, pervasive across the platforms and we’re scaling. We’re scaling new emerging areas like blockchain, where again, we’ve got 75 active blockchain networks in production, and we’ve got engagements in over 500 clients around global trade, universal payments, around trade finance, around food safety, et cetera. So, we see that part of the portfolio continue to improve. So, when you bring it all together, we expect with a strong pipeline that we would return IBM software back to an expectation of modest growth in the fourth quarter. And we’ll see as we get through fourth quarter, how that momentum will continue in ‘19, and we’ll talk in January.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Let’s go to the next question, please.
Operator
Next question is from Keith Bachman from BMO.
Keith Bachman
Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about Technology Services and Cloud Platforms. A little less focused on Q4 but more focused on the outlook say for CY ‘19. And the simple question is, can it grow? The backdrop to the question is, your backlog is down a little bit, but I think your duration is also down. But, against that context, is Technology Services support declined meaningfully this quarter down 3%? With presumably being a harder mainframe cycle next year, can that grow and enable the whole business unit to grow? So, if you could just talk more broadly about the outlook for Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, with particular bias to CY ‘19? Thank you. 
Jim Kavanaugh
Sure. Thank you very much for the question. I appreciate it. Remember, within this segment, we got multiple components. And I think you want to get to the services aspect of Technology Services and Cloud Platform. But, let me start first with the integration software, which is essential part of our integrated value proposition around our hybrid cloud strategy, which differentiates us in the marketplace. You’ve seen consistent growth over the last couple quarters. And we think given that differentiated value proposition that we’ve got momentum in that space, and we’ve always focused on being open, a secure platform in driving differentiation around multi cloud as we move forward. That integration software is going to be a critical component of that moving forward. So that’s that.
Now, let’s go to our Technology Services or GTS part of the business. Remember, that’s made up of two primary offering segments, one TSS, which has been a drag on us throughout 2018, and that is entirely aligned to what our expectations would have been with a mainframe product launch cycle. Typically, we’ll see that cycle hurt us in the first 5 to 6 quarters and then it comes back and accelerate, especially coupled with our extension into multi-vendor service where we’ve been quite well as we move forward. And the margin dynamics by the way are very strong in that portfolio. So, as we start accelerating growth, we’ll see better operating leverage in that segment as we go forward.
And then finally, you have your core infrastructure service offering, and that ties right back to our overall outsourcing backlog that you quoted and it ties back to our success in moving our enterprise clients to the cloud. And I talked earlier about over 30% of our backlog now sits in cloud in new SI content is approaching 45% overall. Durations, you’re right, have been reduced as we continue to execute. And again, fourth quarter is huge. We expect a good quarter, and that will position 2019 as we execute to deliver the value for our clients.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thank you, Keith. Mark, let’s take just one more question.
Operator
Our last question is coming from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald.
Joseph Foresi
Hi. I think you’ve given a mid-single-digit long-term growth target in Cognitive Solutions. Is that still a target and can you hit it in ‘19? And then, how do you feel about the portfolio at this point? Could you be divesting other pieces? Thanks.
Jim Kavanaugh
Yes. Thanks, Joe. I appreciate the question overall. Obviously, we’ll get into 2019 in January. We got a lot of work to do ahead of us. Again, as I said, we’re 16 days into arguably the most important quarter, given the amount of large transactional business that we’ve got to get done. I talked about my answer on Cognitive. We see a good opportunity pipeline ahead of us right now. We believe in the portfolio, the strength of it, the offerings we have to deliver differentiated value to our enterprise clients overall. And we expect, as I stated, IBM software to return to modest growth here in the fourth quarter.
And as we play fourth quarter out, we’ll see, as we get into January where we move forward. You’re right, our model is mid-single-digit growth. We believe we’ve got the right portfolio for that. But, as always, portfolio optimization has been a critical strategy to our overall business model and our financial model. And you’ve seen that play out over time not only on where we invest our capital organically, but where we leverage M&A and how we create value for our clients and for IBM shareholders and also where we divest in areas that either didn’t meet our strategic fit or our financial requirements on where we see growth and more importantly profit pools move forward. So we’ll continue to evaluate that, and we’ll update you in 2019 on where we’re at.
So, with that, let me close up the call. And I like to thank all of you for joining us here today. So, our results through the third quarter reflect the work we’ve been doing collectively across 366,000 IBMers around the world, around how we reallocated capital, how we’ve taken bold actions around where we placed our investments, and how we’ve repositioned our business. And then we’ve done all the work on how we transform the way we operate in our operating model overall. And you see that play out in our margins, in our level of operating leverage and productivity here in the third quarter, which we expect going into fourth quarter and beyond. You see those results, profit margins are strong. You see it in the innovation and differentiation that we’ll bring into the market, especially in areas like hybrid cloud, how we’re winning in digital with our GBS business and around data and AI and security.
So with that said, we’ll talk more about hybrid cloud in particular at the end of this month, when Arvind and Martin Jetter will host the next webcast in our investor webcast series. So, I’d like to thank you all for joining us today. And as always, it’s back to work for all of us. Take care.

Thanks, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us. In the second quarter, we delivered $20 billion of revenue, $3.4 billion of operating pretax income and $3.08 of operating earnings per share. Overall, it was a good quarter. We grew revenue, operating gross profit, pretax income, and earnings per share with strong pretax margin performance. Our revenue was up 4% as reported with growth in all four of our major segments and our constant currency revenue growth was 2%. This is our best constant currency growth in seven years. And our pretax income was up 11%, reflecting good operating leverage on that revenue growth.
Looking at our performance at constant currency. The revenue trajectory improved in both services segments and both returned to modest growth. This is important to our overall revenue growth profile as services represents about 60% of our revenue on an annual basis. In Cognitive, we had good performance in analytics and in our industry verticals, driven by financial services, and IoT. Growth was mitigated by the same three areas I told you about on our last call as we continue to focus on repositioning these offerings. And we had strong performance and gained share in our Systems business, which was up over 20% with growth across all three hardware platforms.
Across our segments, we had continue momentum in our strategic imperatives revenue. Over the last 12 months, our strategic imperatives revenue has grown to $39 billion, which represents 48% of IBM's revenue. And within that, cloud is now $18.5 billion. Our strategic imperatives revenue in the quarter was up 15% and accelerated to 13% at constant currency. Revenue performance this quarter was led by security and cloud. Security was up about 80% this quarter, driven by strong demand for the pervasive encryption of IBM Z and growth in our integrated software and services business. Cloud revenue was up 20% or 18% at constant currency, driven by our as-a-Service offerings. We’re exiting the second quarter within as-a-Service annual run rate of over $11 billion, which is up about 25%. This reflects our success in helping enterprise clients with their journey to the cloud and we’re becoming the destination for mission-critical workloads in hybrid environments. We’re capturing this high-value growth with our unique differentiation of the innovative technology combined with deep industry expertise underpinned with trust and security, all through our integrated model.
You saw that this quarter in a long-term partnership with the Australian government, valued at about $740 million to automate and digitize government services, leveraging IBM systems, software, and cloud-based solutions. We expanded our work at Crédit Mutuel, who is using the IBM Cloud, security, IBM Z and Watson to drive its next wave of transformation across its business lines. We delivered the world’s most powerful supercomputer to the U.S. Department of Energy. We had competitive cloud wins at leading companies like ExxonMobil, Amtrak and Telefónica de España.
We signed a deal with Anthem where we will help them drive their digital transformation to deliver an enhanced digital experience for millions of health plan consumers. And in total, we signed 13 services deals over a $100 million this quarter. These are just a few of the new client engagements that will play out over the coming quarters and years. And putting this together with our first half performance, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for the year.
Before getting into the detailed financial metrics, I want to provide a perspective on the drivers of our operating earnings per share growth for the quarter. What it shows as we deliver 5% growth, despite a significant tax headwind? So, let me break it down.
Our 4% revenue growth contributed $0.10 of earnings per share growth at constant margin. We realized good pretax operating leverage on that revenue growth with 11% growth in pretax income and we expanded our pretax margin by 110 basis points. About two thirds of that pretax income growth came from gross profit dollars, which were up 2%, driven by profit growth in Global Business Services and Systems. Gross margin was down 60 basis points year-to-year, about half was due to mix and half from the continued investments we’ve been making to build out our IBM Cloud. Productivity was fairly neutral to the year-to-year gross margin dynamics in the quarter. And as we discussed last quarter, the benefit from actions we took earlier in the year will ramp up in the second half. The remaining third of the pretax income growth came from efficiencies we’ve been driving in our expense structure. And then, as I said, tax was a significant headwind, driven primarily by discrete tax benefit last year. Finally, a lower share count contributed to growth. Putting it all together, we delivered the 5% growth with good contribution from revenue, pretax margin expansion and to a lesser extent, share repurchases.
Looking at our key financial metrics. As I said, revenue was up 4%. Currency contributed 2 points, which is about half the contribution, based on the spot rates at the time of our first quarter earnings call. And I’ll remind you, the significant volatility in currencies has implications across the income statement, not just revenue. Constant currency revenue was up 2%, which is essentially all organic. I’ll talk to revenue on a constant currency basis going forward. Our revenue growth was broad-based across geographies and sectors. We had growth in more than 60 countries, representing over 80% of IBM’s revenue. EMEA growth accelerated to 4%, led by Germany, the UK, France and Spain with pervasive growth across business areas.
Looking at our operating pretax income growth of 11%, I said that about one-third of that was from operating expense, which was better by 2%. This includes a 2-point impact from currency, which is significantly less than the first quarter impact due to the dollar strengthening. And so, our base expense was better by 4%. As we continue to invest to build our innovation pipeline in areas like AI and security and blockchain, we’re also realizing acquisition synergies and driving operational efficiencies by streamlining our management system, scaling agile and implementing new ways of working. I talked about some of these in our webcast back in March. And we’re seeing the benefit not only in improved speed and responsiveness, but also in a more efficient structure. Within expense, we also absorbed a lower level of IT income, which was down $115 million year-to-year in the quarter, and about $240 million in the first half. Our operating tax rate of 16% was up nearly 7 points with just over a point from the underlying rate and the balance from last year’s discrete tax benefits of a $170 million.
Looking at the cash metrics. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.2 billion in the first half, which is down $400 million year-to-year. Our solid working capital performance was more than offset by a cash tax headwind and growth in capital investments, consistent with what we discussed earlier in the year. Remember, there’s a lot of seasonality in our cash generation. And over the last 12 months, we generated $12.6 billion, that’s 111% of GAAP net income.
Now, turning to our segments. Cognitive Solutions had $4.6 billion of revenue, which was down 1% at constant currency. We had continued growth in our as-a-Service revenue, exiting the quarter within annualized run rate of $2 billion. Within Solutions Software, we’re scaling new platforms and solutions with growth in several key areas, I’ll name a few. Growth in our underlying analytics platform was led by DB2 portfolio, our data science offerings and our new IBM Cloud Private for data offering, which makes data ready for AI across the clouds. In our Watson platform, the AI platform for business, growth reflects strong demand for our new virtual assistant offering with triple digit growth in our conversation service usage. Clients using Watson Assistant include Bradesco, Orange Bank, Autodesk, Royal Bank of Scotland, Vodafone and LivePerson, to name a few.
Watson is both a platform on its own and a driver of growth in differentiation in several of our industry verticals. Our industry verticals continue to scale, led by IoT and Watson for Financial Services. IoT growth was driven by Maximo, which is the number one asset management solution, and Tririga, the number one facilities management solutions.
Financial services reflect strong performance in our risk and regulatory business and financial crimes portfolio, leveraging our promontory skills and AI technologies. In Watson Health, we had good performance in areas like payer and life sciences. And in emerging areas like blockchain, we’ve now seeded the market with over 60 active blockchain networks. This quarter, we launched We.trade with nine large banks including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC and Natixis. This is the first live blockchain-based bank-to-bank trading platform.
Growth in these areas is offset by a transition in some areas I talked about in April, specifically, talent, collaboration and commerce, which today are a combination of on-perm and SaaS offerings. We are modernizing our offerings and making investments to address the secular shifts in the market. Keep in mind, the time-to-value of these investments is longer in SaaS.
Our Transaction Processing Software was down 2%, driven by declines in storage software. Within TPS, we had growth in IBM Z middleware and Power middleware.
Looking at profit this quarter, we grew pretax income 9% and expanded pretax margin by over 2 points year-to-year, driven by operational efficiencies and acquisition synergies, while continuing to invest at high levels in key strategic areas such as AI, security and blockchain.
Before getting into Global Business Services, let me give you a perspective on our total services business across the two segments. We continue to make good progress. Our services signings grew, the year-to-year your services backlog trajectory improved from last quarter. Services revenue returned to growth, and we had a modest improvement in the year-to-year your services gross margin trajectory. Our signings were up 6% and within that we had 13 deals over a $100 million. So, we’re clearly winning in a competitive environment. We’re addressing the fundamental shifts in the industry, like helping clients implement hybrid cloud and manage security services. This is driving a shift in our backlog content with nearly 30% of our outsourcing backlog now in cloud. And then looking at the services gross margin, it was down just 25 basis points year-to-year. I’ll remind you again that we have most of the benefits from the first quarter productivity actions still ahead of us.
So, now, let’s get into the two segments. Global Business Services returned to modest revenue growth, increased gross profit dollars and expanded gross margins. We’re realizing the improved revenue trajectory from the run-out of our opening backlog for the year. Our strategic imperatives grew 6% with strong performance in the as-a-Service offerings, which were up 25%. We have talked about how we’ve realigned our practice model around three growth platforms, digital transformation, cloud application and cognitive processes. While all are progressing, we have particularly strength in digital, which again grew strong double digits. This was driven by digital business strategy and by our mobile offerings.
Across these platforms, consulting revenue growth accelerated to 4% year-to-year, led by our offerings in digital and cloud. Our GBS consulting practice brings business expertise together with technology expertise to unlock value for our clients. For example, this quarter, IBM Digital and Mediaocean launched a blockchain consortium comprised of leading advertisers and publishers, including Kellogg, Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Pfizer, to set the new industry standard for the digital ad-buying ecosystem. We’re continuing to invest recently announcing the acquisition of Oniqua Holdings, which adds technology and professional expertise and asset optimization. This strengthens our integrated IoT platform across Cognitive Solutions and GBS.
Application management services revenue was down 3%, reflecting continued declines in traditional enterprise application managed services. We’re growing in strategic offerings like Cloud Migration Factory and Cloud Application Development. The increased demand in these areas has led to two consecutive quarters of double-digit signings growth in application management.
Turning to gross profit. GBS’ gross margin grew 130 basis points year-to-year. We have done a lot of work to transform our portfolio and reposition our offerings to capture improved price for value, and we are also starting to see early contributions from our productivity actions around labor models and structure.
In summary, GBS delivered a solid quarter, and we’re starting to see the realization of our initiatives in our results.
In Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, revenue returned to growth. Similar to GBS, this performance was driven primarily by our improved opening backlog run-out dynamics. The strategic imperatives revenue in this segment grew 24%. This was led by cloud, which grew 27% and our as-a-Service revenue grew 30%, which is up about 6 points sequentially and is now at an annualized run rate of $7.6 billion.
Infrastructure services revenue growth improved to 1% this quarter, as we continue to help clients on their journey to cloud. The IBM Cloud enables clients to migrate, modernize and build new cloud apps, is AI ready and secure to the core. This quarter we completed the migration of Westpac’s core banking applications to the IBM Cloud. It’s just one example of how we’re becoming the go to destination for mission-critical workloads on the cloud. We’re continuing to build capabilities, recently announcing an expansion to 18 availability zones for the IBM Cloud across the world. To expand the global footprint, it is important as clients look to maintain control of their data, as they implement hybrid, especially given the increased data regulations.
In technical support services, revenue was down 4%. As is always the case with the Z launch, we’re seeing a short-term impact in our maintenance stream, as IBM Z sales move client from maintenance to warranty for the first year. The impact to maintenance is becoming more pronounced now with the higher adoption rates by existing clients in the strong current Z cycle. This impact was moderated by continued growth in our multivendor support offerings.
Integration software grew 1%. We had good performance in offerings that modernize applications and enable cloud adoption. This includes offerings like IBM Cloud Private, which helps clients to develop cloud native applications behind their firewall. We’ve added a 100 new clients in the second quarter and now have over 300 clients since the product was announced at the end of last year.
Turning to gross profit. Margin for the segment was down a point from last year. The majority of this decline was driven by the revenue mix away from higher margin TSS in the quarter, with the remainder driven by continued scale out of our cloud. We did have some productivity benefits, but as I said earlier, the actions we took in the first quarter will yield predominantly in the back half of the year.
In Systems, we grew revenue again, as we continue to deliver innovative technologies that address today’s most contemporary workloads. All three brands IBM Z, Power and Storage grew and we gained share overall.
In this second quarter, IBM Z grew revenues by 112% year-to-year on nearly 200% MIPS growth, again driven by new workload MIPS. The z14 adoption remain broad-based and after four quarters continues to track ahead of the prior program. The value prop benefits existing IBM Z clients who are growing and expanding workloads on z14 this quarter, whether it’s ecommerce sales, mobile banking volumes, machine learning or emerging blockchain services. And we are adding new clients from all corners of the globe from a managed care provider in the U.S., to a University in Canada, to an electronics distributor in Italy, to a bank in Africa. We also had good acceptance of our new single-frame z14 designed specifically for cloud environments, which launched earlier in the quarter.
Power revenue was up 4% driven by adoption of our new POWER9 entry level portfolio, and continued growth in Linux. These cloud-ready systems provide leadership capabilities in advanced analytics, cloud environments, and data intensive workloads in AI, HANA and UNIX markets. We continued to roll out our supercomputers at the U.S. Department of Energy labs. As part of our deployment, the U.S. government recently unveiled the POWER9-based Summit, the world’s most powerful supercomputer which is ranked number one in the TOP500 List of commercially available computers. This is the first time in over five years that a U.S. company topped the list.
Storage hardware returned to growth this quarter, after facing some sales execution challenges in a competitive market last quarter. This growth was broad-based geographically and led by strong growth in all flash arrays. Flash grew double digits across the portfolio and took share. We are coming out with new offerings, including a new midrange FlashSystem announced last week, with industry-leading performance technology.
Turning to profit. Systems pretax income was up about $275 million year-to-year and pretax margin was up over 10 points, so solid performance.
Moving on to cash flow and balance sheet. In the second quarter, we generated $2.9 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables, and $1.9 billion of free cash flow. And so, in the first half, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow, which is down $400 million from last year. This reflects solid working capital performance, offset by a $300 million increase in CapEx, as we build out global cloud data centers, and $700 million more of cash tax payments. We’ve now got the entire cash tax headwind that we expect for the year, behind us.
Looking at uses of cash for the half. We’ve returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders. In April, we again raised our dividend. And with that, we’ve now tripled our dividend per share over the last decade. In the first half, we bought back nearly 12 million shares, ending June with 913 million shares outstanding and $2 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Looking at the balance sheet highlights, our cash and total debt levels are pretty consistent with last June. About two thirds of our debt supports our financing business, which is leveraged at 9 to 1. And the majority of our financing receivables, 54% are at investment grade which is 2 points better than this time last year. So, our balance sheet remains strong with plenty of flexibility to support our investments and shareholder returns over the longer term.
In summary, our performance this quarter underscores the extent to which we have repositioned our business over the last several years. As I said, nearly half of our revenue is aligned to the strategic imperatives, which represent the emerging, high-value, high-growth segments in our industry. This also reflects a major portfolio shift for IBM, driven as we discussed at our investor webcast in March, by major shifts in our capital allocation and investment strategy. Those shifts reflect our vision of what clients would value in a rapidly reordering IT industry, driven by cloud, data and AI, and that is innovative technology in key emerging areas, the expertise to apply that technology in industry-specific processes and workflows, and a commitment that their enterprise data would be handled responsibly. This is IBM’s differentiation, and we’re seeing it come through in our revenue and profit performance.
This quarter, we delivered 2% constant currency revenue growth, 11% operating pretax income growth, and 5% earnings per share growth, capping off a first half where we also grew revenue, operating profit and earnings per share.
As always, we have some tailwinds and headwinds as we move into the second half. But with this performance and our continued focus on driving consistent operational execution, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share, and free cash flow in the range of $12 billion.
And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia for Q&A.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So, operator, let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes. Thank you. Jim, you saw some constant currency deceleration in Cognitive revenues but PTI margins improved nicely. You alluded to a few factors in there. I was wondering if you could provide some more granularity on the drivers of that PTI margin expansion between the operational efficiencies, the acquisition synergies that you alluded to and the relative pace of investment. And secondarily, your base expense decline was quite significant in the quarter. Can you talk about the trajectory of that in the second half, especially given some of the cost actions that you said are yet to be reflected, the cost actions that you took in 1Q, they are yet to be reflected in the back half?
Jim Kavanaugh
Sure, Wamsi. Thank you very much for the question. Let me address the Cognitive Solutions segment first and talk about constant currency and then get to the operating leverage component. And then, I’ll address your expense question next. Cognitive Solutions, first of all, as you all know, our financial model for the Cognitive Solutions segment is to deliver growth and also deliver operating leverage consistent with that growth. And what we’ve been seeing over the last couple of quarters, as we’ve been driving the acquisition integration synergies across our business, we’ve been seeing that operating leverage well in advance of our actual revenue growth within that segment. We’ve also been driving operational efficiencies and synergies around redefining how we do work, redefining development optimization, applying agile methodologies in getting better speed, responsiveness, cycle time and throughput and output within our organizations. So, we’re getting more value for dollar spend overall. And you see that play out in operating leverage in that segment in the first quarter and you’ve seen it play out in the second quarter with strong profit growth of 9% on that constant currency revenue growth. So, we continue to expect that as we move forward and will continue to leverage and get value out of that business overall.
In terms of expense dynamics, you heard in the prepared remarks, our operating expense was better by 2%, but there are many different components within that operating expense 2% better. First and foremost, currency had impacted our operating expense by 2 points. Now, I will tell you that was about half of the impact or even a little bit less than half the impact than we expected 90 days ago, just given the volatility of what’s been happening in the FX markets, in particular around the U.S. dollar appreciation. So, the last couple quarters, currencies impacted by expense by 4 to 5 points, now, it was only a 2-point impact. So, our base productivity was about 4% better. And that is being driven as we continue to drive the operating leverage through our enterprise productivity initiatives around reinventing IBM and how we actually do work, changing our management system, addressing our structure, attacking cost and complexity, aligning decision rights and driving accountability. So, that 4% is a base level productivity that we’re driving and we expect that going forward.
And then, I’ll just add one other point and that is on IP income. You see, through the second quarter, our IP income was down by over $100 million -- $115 million I think to be exact; and through the first half, it’s down nearly $250 million overall. So, we continue to leverage and monetize the value of our research and development spending and we continue to invest in those areas, and we’ll opportunistically optimize that through many modernizations models, but IP right now is down a 115. When you bring all that together, it’s delivering substantial operating leverage to our business, as you’re seeing here in the second quarter.
Operator
The next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is now open.
Steve Milunovich
A fair amount of your growth in revenue and even pretax profit came from the hardware area. What are you expecting in terms of second half mainframe compares? Are we going to be down year-over-year in the third and then down pretty severely in the fourth? And then, just to follow up on your currency comments. I assume you’re losing about $2 billion of revenue in the second half relative to what you expected back in April. Have you taken actions to compensate for that to get to your $13.80, to get to your $12 billion of free cash flow?
Jim Kavanaugh
Yes. So, thank you, Steve. Many questions there. So, let me take each one individually. First of all, yes, we had a very strong Systems quarter overall, both on revenue and on operating leverage where we grew pretax income over 10 points year-over-year. But, let’s put the quarter in perspective.
We delivered 4% revenue overall, 2% at constant currency. It was our strongest constant currency revenue growth rate in over seven years. And it was led by our continued acceleration in our strategic imperatives which were up 15% at actual, 13% at constant currency. That was an acceleration from the first quarter. And within that our cloud business $18.5 billion, up 23%; our as-a-Service annualized run rate now over $11 billion, that’s up 24%; and our services businesses returned back to growth at constant currency, both GBS, which had a great quarter and TS&CP.
But even if you take our Systems business and to your question around mainframe, and if we take mainframe out, you would see those same dynamics in the quarter-to-quarter acceleration of our strategic imperative business. And as you all know, in our as-a-Service acceleration of over $11 billion growing 24%, that doesn’t have any Systems business within it.
And the last point I’ll bring up around top-line, then I’ll get to your other questions. We had broad-based geographic and sector growth across our business, probably the best breadth and growth across a number of countries that we’ve had in quite a period of time. 60 plus countries grew at constant currency, and that represented over 80% of IBM’s revenue. And if you extract out the mainframe cycle, we still had over 60% of our -- or excuse me, 60 countries that actually grew. And those are large countries like Japan, like UK, like Germany, France, Spain, Australia, many which are not mainframe dominant. So, we see continued momentum.
Now, with regards to mainframe, I’m not going to apologize. This is the most enduring platform that you’ve seen out there, and we continue to capitalize on gaining new emerging workloads onto that platform. And we delivered substantial growth in the second quarter, over a 100% growth, and we tripled our installed MIPS inventory that we shipped. And we’re [captioning] [ph], over 60% of that MIPS ship is in specialty workloads. So through the first four quarters -- now, it’s a pertinent time to have the discussion, through the first four quarters, we are well in advance of what the prior cycle was.
And with regards to your question about second half, I would expect that to continue in the second half as we move forward. We know in the fourth quarter that we got a tremendous compare, and I talked about that 90 days ago. So, we will have an impact, but we’ve got momentum in our services businesses returning to growth. And as you know that’s 60% of our business overall.
Now, with regards to currency. I’m glad that you brought that up. We’ve seen dramatic volatility over the last 90 days since our last earnings call. And to put it in perspective, we had stated here 90 days ago that we expected about a 4-point tailwind in the second quarter coming off of a 5-point tailwind in the first quarter. And you see that that only ended up being a little bit over 2 points of a tailwind in the second quarter as the U.S. dollar appreciated significantly against most currencies.
Now, when we look at the second half, the second half, we see about a 1 to 2-point headwind, currency will flip, and that’s about somewhere in the neighborhood of the $1.5 billion including second quarter’s $400 million that I talked about. Now, with that said, currency -- you understand the top-line dynamic of revenue, but currency also impacts margins and they impact expense. From a margin perspective, if you look at -- we’ve got two different businesses, we’ve got a product-based business and we’ve got services-based businesses. On product-based businesses, you don’t have a direct alignment of your sources of revenue and your sources of cost. So, that translation revenue impact that you see in our product-based businesses, a hardware, software and services, you will see a gross margin impact on that at the GP line. Services, where you have a much more alignment of source of revenue, of course you have basically a natural hedge, you won’t see a gross profit impact on that revenue translation. But as you all know, we drive a hedging programs to mitigate the foreign exchange volatility at a profit level. Why? Because it gives us time to address our pricing terms, our structure and our sourcing strategies. So, at a PTI level, you see a very de minimis impact in period. Currency doesn’t eliminate -- excuse me, hedging doesn’t eliminate, it only defers it, but at a profit level, it’s a very de minimis impact but it impacts the P&L differently as we move forward.

The next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Katy Huberty
Jim, as was mentioned in earlier question, investors are certainly worried about the tougher comps in the back half of this year, and the 2% growth was a nice surprise this quarter, but you’re quite at consistent and meaningful growth across the businesses. And so, my question is whether you and the rest of the management team would consider stepping up, either M&A or divestitures to more meaningfully remix revenue and set the Company on a path in a narrative around much more meaningful and sustainable growth?
Jim Kavanaugh
Yes. As you stated, we delivered a very solid quarter at 2% constant currency. And I would say, it’s our third straight quarter of growth overall with an acceleration in terms of breadth and depth across geographies, across sectors and across countries around the world.
But, let’s take a look at our portfolio. First and foremost, we are very confident in the portfolio lineup that we have here today around each of our segments. We talked about at our investor day the value differentiation of IBM. And that value differentiation is built around innovative technology, around deep industry expertise, and around trust and security, all delivered through an integrated model.
And if you take a look at it, we talked about the key value differentiators as we move forward. And the value of bringing that together, I think you’re seeing instantiated now here in the second quarter with very strong growth overall in our systems platform, and the importance they play to our infrastructure, in our integrated model, you see our services base of businesses continue that trajectory improvement that we talked about starting in January of this year, we improved in the first quarter, and now we got both businesses back to growth, and we delivered double-digit signings at actual rates in the first half, which positions us well as we move forward. But, you know our model overall, we’ve done a lot of work around remixing our capital and investment to build out the portfolio that we have today. And we’re very disciplined in our capital allocation strategy. We said 70% to 80% of that capital and investment is going to go back to our shareholders in the form of share buyback and dividend and you saw us raise our dividend here in April this year, our 23rd straight year. But, the remainder is for us to use internally to build out our differentiated capability around investments in R&D and capital to drive leadership in AI, leadership in blockchain, leadership in security and leadership now in quantum as we move forward. But acquisitions are an integral part, and we’re going to continue to evaluate our portfolio and how we capitalize the value of those acquisitions, in light of the integrated differentiated strategy of the IBM Company going forward.
Operator
The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Toni Sacconaghi
I’m wondering if you could comment a little bit more about the dynamics affecting Cognitive Solutions revenue growth. It was down at constant currency versus a pretty easy comparison. And it’s the business that has the highest percentage of strategic initiatives in it. So, it’s obviously very important for you. Can you maybe comment specifically on what’s happening with Watson Health? There were lots of press reports that a significant retrenchment in that business. And I know you said the acquisitions take time. But, you’ve had them all for at least a year. And so, maybe even comment on why you think we haven’t seen better revenue progress or what specifically happened this quarter. And then, very quickly, if you could just confirm, you talked about flattish gross margins for the year. You’re down in each of the first two quarters year-over-year. So, should we be expecting gross margins to be up about 50 basis points year-over-year in the second half to sort of hit that bogey flattish?
Jim Kavanaugh
There is a lot you compacted in a multiple parts question, but let me try to address each piece. So, let’s start with Cognitive. In terms of our Cognitive Solutions, we have a strong portfolio in the key strategic areas around analytics, around industry verticals, around security and around IoT, and we continue to see good performance overall. But, I’ll remind you, this portfolio is a high-annuity content. Over 80% of the business is annuity with strong renewal rates we continue to drive, but that SaaS has a longer time to value and longer time to realization. But, let me unpack the segment because you got to understand the piece parts because they each fit different purposes within the overarching IBM strategy and purpose.
One is around TPS. TPS declined 2% overall, and it’s about what we would expect in this area and you’ve even commented on this in the last couple quarters. We been riding the wave of the mainframe product cycle over the last three quarters and saw a pretty good growth that was unusual. Now we’re back to down 2%. This is high-value, high-profit, strategically important to our clients overall, but it’s in stable to declining businesses, and it wasn’t unexpected.
And when you look at our software solution portfolio, we’ve got growth in analytics as we revamped that portfolio coming off of a pretty disappointing fourth quarter. We grew in first quarter, we grew again in second, and we got good double-digit growth in our industry verticals like financial services and IoT, and we’re seeing good growth in Watson Health. We got growth in life sciences segment, imaging, payer and we’re seeing good SaaS signings in our government segments within that business. Yes, we are driving acquisition synergies, and you’re seeing that play out; it’s well in advance of a year, and you’re seeing that operating leverage play out well in advance of our financial model around Cognitive Solutions.
So transaction processing software, pretty much as expected high-value base market, software solutions, the key strategic areas that we have are growing. The focus that we’ve got and we’ve talked about this 90 days ago, three key segments around talent, around collaboration and around commerce where we are investing to modernize our portfolio to address the secular shifts that are happening in both client value and in consumption models. As you know, this business today in these three segments are both the mixture of on-prem and SaaS. And we are investing aggressively to revitalize this portfolio into a SaaS world around driving user interface improvements to make our offerings more digitally consumable, and also about shifting and investing to embed AI to deliver differentiated value for our clients overall. So, that’s Cognitive Solutions.
Now, you asked about gross profit margins. So, let me take a step back and give you my perspective. Now, that I’ve been on the job six months as CFO of IBM, and I spent a lot of time with our investors and also with many of you, the sell side analysts, listening and also getting a perspective of our Company, the sentiment and the strategic positioning, and what you would like to see. And in each of those inevitably, the discussion around margin comes up. Why? Because yes, we are value-based stock. Our investment thesis is around value. Value driving profit growth at the end of the day that gives us the free cash flow flexibility to continue to return value to our shareholders and invest in our business. But, the discussion around gross profit margins always inevitably get at services. If service is deflationary and can you grow services margins? And I would tell you, I think that’s at the heart of your question around gross profit. And I’ll answer it in a couple of ways. One, talking about our financial model; and two, talking about how we manage the business.
But before I get into that, first and foremost, the net answer is, as I stated 90 days ago, we expect our services gross margins to expand in the second half and we still feel confident coming off of the trajectory improvement of what we saw in the second quarter really led by strong margin expansion in our GBS business and the productivity actions we have in front of us. But, when you look at this from an overall IBM perspective, our financial model, as we talked about is low-single digit revenue growth, mid-single digit profit growth and high-single digit EPS growth. And in 2Q, you saw the instantiation of delivering that model. We grew revenue, we had PTI margin expansion of 110 basis points, strongest we’ve had in years, and we drove operating leverage to deliver 11% profit growth, well in excess of our model.
So from a full year perspective, our view at an operating level in terms of profit growth has not changed. We’re going to grow profit, we’re going to grow PTI margins, and that supports our full year guidance.
Now, let’s talk about how we manage the business. Because I think it’s important for our investors, and it’s important for each of you as analysts to understand this. Number one, we got two distinct different business models in our company. We got a product-based business model and we got a services based business model. In a product-based business model, hardware, software, and solutions, value is instantiated in delivering returns at a PTI level. Why? Because all the investment we make in a product-based business ends up below the gross profit margin line. And you see in our product-based businesses systems and Cognitive Solutions, we’re growing substantial operating leverage and we’re growing substantial return on investment.
Now in services, as I said 90 days ago, in a human capital-based business values instantiated in gross profit margins. And we manage our services business to get a return on our human capital at the gross profit level. And as I said, at a gross profit level in services, we still expect to expand margins in the second half. The only thing that has changed in the last 90 days has been the extreme volatility in the FX world around the U.S. dollar appreciation. And as I stated earlier, we have a hedging policy that mitigates the volatility of currency in our I&E at profit level but it does impact gross margins in particular, at a product level in our product-based businesses; does not impact profit in the near term, it allows you time to then go adjust your pricing terms, your cost structure and your sourcing strategies as we move forward. So, that’s the only thing that’s changed in the last 90 days. We feel confident we’re going to grow revenue for the year at current spot rates, even in light of currency flip into a headwind in the second half, we feel confident we’re going to expand pretax margins, similar to what we did in the second quarter, in the second half, and within that we feel confident we’re actually going to deliver services gross profit margin expansion in the second half of the year.

The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Tien-tsin Huang
So, consulting accelerated, which is encouraging. I am curious is that starting to pull in some other services revenue around it or behind it? I saw -- or you mentioned, the large [indiscernible] were good again. So, again is this enough to drive the positive FX neutral revenue growth in services in the second half, just trying to piece all those things together and think about future revenue growth for services overall, in the second half?
Jim Kavanaugh
Yes. If you take a look at GBS in second quarter, first of all, we’re very pleased with our performance. The work that Mark and the team have done tirelessly to transform our structure, our business models, our growth platforms, the set of initiatives around productivity, we’re very pleased, and you saw that play out in continued trajectory improvement throughout the first half and returning to modest revenue growth and significant operating leverage and margin expansion, which we expect will be a big contributor in our second half services margin expansion that we talked about in the last question.
Now, with that said, if you look at that acceleration and what’s been happening in the trajectory of our services business, first, as you all understand the dynamics of that business, you have to get signings that have to yield into backlog, which has to yield into revenue as we move forward. And we’re seeing tremendous momentum in our consulting base of business. We delivered 4% revenue growth, as you stated, in the second quarter. And that’s leveraging momentum around how we redesign our growth platforms, and how we redesign our service lines and offerings and practices. And we’re capturing higher value, value around digital transformation offerings that enable clients to move their journey to the cloud as we move forward, we’re doing great in our CRM practice, our workday practice, and we’re also capturing new emerging areas like blockchain, where we’re seeing good growth in our services base of business at all.
And as you know and we talked about extensively at our investor webcast at the beginning of the year, GBS has a very integral part and an integrated model strategy of the IBM Company. They have the mission of bringing business and technology transformation together. So, the long answer to your question around, is consulting and GBS, a key leading indicator of dragging the rest of IBM, the answer is definitely yes.
Operator
The next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jim Schneider
I was wondering if you could maybe kind of follow up on that prior question, talk about the ability of the Tech Services & Cloud Platform segment to start to return to growth in the back half. And clearly, we’re starting to get a little bit better signings performance. But, I’m wondering if that’s a realistic expectation for the back half for that segment and whether you can achieve it at the same time as you are expanding margins there?
Jim Kavanaugh
Sure, Jim, and good to talk to you again. Thanks for the question. Yes. On TS&CP, similar to our discussion around GBS, we’re pleased with the trajectory improvement and the progress that we’ve been making within this business on a top line throughout the first half. We made sequential progress quarter-to-quarter. We have now returned to growth delivering $8.6 billion of revenue. So, let’s talk about a couple of the key components.
First, we are capitalizing on tremendous momentum around enterprise hybrid cloud strategy. We are becoming the destination of moving and enabling our clients’ journey to the cloud. And our GTS business is an instrumental part of that strategy as we move forward. So, we got a lot of momentum in our enterprise hybrid cloud that as you see is delivering and as-a-Service annualized run rate of $7.6 billion, that’s up 30% year-to-year, and that has tremendous value as we move forward to continue getting scale efficiencies and the like.
But, let’s talk about then the core GTS business overall. Infrastructure services returned to growth 1% in the quarter. And it’s really been built off of a very strong first half where we delivered double-digit signings growth at the GTS and TS&CP segment level. And now, you saw our backlog continues to improve. Our backlog now in total is $116 billion. And within that 30% of that backlog now is cloud as we continue to capitalize on the secular shift and deliver more and more value overall. Our integration software business has grown 1% and continues to grow through the first half. And what we’ve got to work on, and this is part of having an integrated portfolio and part of having success in other areas, our TSS business is down 4% but that’s a function of us significantly overachieving against our last program, our mainframe product cycle. And we see a deceleration in TSS, but we’re seeing the offset in our systems base of business going forward. So, when you look at that trajectory improvement, we returned our backlog back to flat in the second quarter in TS&CP. And again, a lot of work ahead of us. We got a few second half signings, we got a good opportunity pipeline, but I see continued trajectory improvement. And then our focus on margins as we move forward in the second half to deliver second half services gross profit margin expansion are going to be critical to our guidance.

The next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.
David Grossman
This year, you are guiding to free cash flow roughly equal to net income, which is above your longer term target. I know it’s way too early to providing 2019 insight. However, are there any factors that are driving the ‘18 free cash flow that may not reoccur next year or even potentially reverse that we should be factoring into our thinking for next year?
Jim Kavanaugh
Yes, David. Thank you very and good to hear from you again. Before I get to the long-term view, I mean, I think you kind of nailed it. Let’s talk about our free cash flow guidance here through the second quarter and more importantly through the first half. First of all, we talked about entering the year that we expected $12 billion of free cash flow; that was down about $1 billion. If you remember, at that point in time, we talked about we were going to continue to invest in our business in terms of capital, to build out our IBM Cloud architecture. And by the way, in the second quarter, I think you have seen the announcement where we expanded 18 new availability zones around the world. So, we are committed to winning in the cloud space, and we’re investing to go do that. But we also saw we’re going to have a significant cash tax headwind here in 2018. And then, our GAAP profit, as we start turning this business and deliver on our at least $13.80 was going to pretty much offset our strong working capital efficiency that we exited last year on with our mainframe cycle.
So, through the first half, we delivered $3.2 billion of free cash flow. That’s down $400 million. But it’s important to understand the underpinnings behind that. Within that we’ve invested $300 million year-to-year, up 20% on capital already through the first half. And we’ve had strong operational pretax -- or excuse me, after-tax profit performance that’s delivered a positive contribution of $600 million to support that investment in capital as we move forward. So, when you do the math then, our entire year-to-year reduction through the first half is all driven by cash tax headwind. And that cash tax headwind is $700 million through the first half, and it’s all behind us now. So, our second half free cash flow, to your point, we’ve always said as a rule of thumb, free cash flow should follow our profit levels. And when you look at our realization, you see a playing out in our realization. We’re well in excess of 100%. And our trailing 12 months is at $12.6 billion and our attainment supports that $12 billion free cash flow level as we move forward.
So, it’s too early to look at ‘19, we’ll deliver that in January, but at least hopefully the answer gives you some of the dynamics of what’s playing out within free cash flow.

The next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.
Keith Bachman
Hi. Thank you very much. Jim, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the durability of services. You’ve talked about GBS and technology and cloud outsourcing growing constant currency in the second half of the year. Yet, backlog, total services backlog is down 1% in constant currency. So, once you recheck growth, are you still calling for durable growth in those businesses, even with backlog down? And then, my follow-up -- well, let me ask my follow-up question after that.
Jim Kavanaugh
Why don’t you ask your follow-up question?
Keith Bachman
Well, just within GBS, something I wanted to come back to, application management is still under pressure as it is for most of the providers. And is that going to continue within the context of GBS, or you actually see application management within the confines of GBS improving?
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay, Keith. So, thank you very much for just giving a better perspective of entirety of your multiple-part questions, so we can put this in perspective. So, let’s talk about -- I’ll drive you back to 180 days ago, when we were sitting here in January. We talked about the position where we were at. We talked about what’s going on with the dynamics of our backlog overall. And we talked about the backlog realization run-out that we saw over the 2018 period. And we said entering 2018 that we had a much stronger backlog realization or run-out I should say that we are starting with that we did entering 2017. And you’re seeing that play out as we go through the first half where we have made sequential year-to-year improvement over the first quarter and now returned both of our services businesses back to growth.
Now, within that, as we stated earlier, in the human capital base services business, you got to continue fueling those signings that delivers backlog and more importantly, you got to drive the right composition of backlog that drives your backlog realization and yield, and also drives duration. And obviously what you’re seeing over time is you’re seeing I think a secular shift with regards to what’s happening to duration in long term contracts. You’re not seeing that anymore. So we’re getting higher yielding revenue, where also the composition of our backlog with consulting, which accelerated to 4%, that composition is much more shorter term and higher value, as we move forward. So, over the long run, you’re right. You got to continue to fuel signings to fuel that backlog. But I would tell you, outer years of six, seven, eight, nine, ten are very -- in today’s world, much less relevant than in period your first year, your second year, your third year in the composition. So, we do feel confident with that trajectory improvement, we came off in first half delivering good growth double digits in signings in the first half and the composition of those signings as I said, we already have 30% of our backlog that’s sitting in cloud. And by the way, over 40% of our backlog is now in key strategic imperative workloads overall. So, that’s kind of your first question.
Your second question, AMS. We talked about AMS. Obviously that’s going through a secular shift in the industry, and you’re seeing that play out against all the competitors that are in the space today. But I would tell you, what differentiates IBM with regards to AMS. One, it’s our value of incumbency. The integrated play, the integrated model of IBM, the value of incumbency and the reason we’re in the AMS business is we understand our clients’ operating models, our clients’ workloads and our clients’ business processes. And we said entering this year that we were seeing success in us leveraging that value of incumbency to be the destination to help our clients with the journey to the cloud and move to the cloud. And we’re seeing that play out in the first half where not only in the first quarter, but also in the second quarter, we had double-digit signings growth in AMS business over time. Again, backlog, yes, is still down overall. Our revenue was down 3%. But, we see this inflection point as we move forward, and we continue to leverage and deliver that value for our clients as they move on their journey overall.

The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citibank. Your line is now open.
Jim Suva
Jim, I just had one question for you. As you sit there in the CFO seat and you’re calling now for margins to accelerate or improve or expand year-over-year in the second half of the year, what are the milestones that are hitting to kind of make you call that out the happiness behind the confidence? What’s the milestones that we can then look back and say, oh! That made a lot of sense and it has long-term durability to it? Thank you.
Jim Kavanaugh
Hey, Jim. Thank you very much for the question. It’s good question overall. Let me take a look at it. I’ve said from January, as we look at we obviously have multiple scenarios, how do we make at least $13.80. And what I look at and the team and the entire management team looks at is the trajectory of our business, the operational indices and the drivers as we see going forward of headwinds and tailwinds on how we deliver that guidance for our shareholders of at least $13.80.
But, when you take a look at revenue growth, I said we would have revenue growth at current spot rates for the full year and that we would have pretax operating margin expansion and operating leverage in our business. So, to your question, what do we look at and what are the trends that are driving that. So, let’ unpack it, and I’ve talked about this the last couple of calls. And the way I look at margin expansion really centers around three or four major areas. Number one, margin expansion is going to be delivered through us continuing to leverage the momentum in our enterprise cloud and our as-a-Service-based business. Why? Because it’s going to generate scale efficiencies for us to deliver on what we’ve said at our Investor Day, which is margin accretion as we move through to the cloud. So, scale efficiencies, we are seeing that improvement in the first quarter, we’re seeing the improvement in the second quarter and it’s all being built off of the momentum around our cloud and our as-a-Service-based business.
Second, we talk about mix, mix being another lever. So, you look at the mix of one within our each of our segments and how we’re shifting to higher value, which we’re making good progress. The best instantiation of that is GBS where they are getting better price realization and better value around remixing their offerings to better value but also across segments we have a big mix headwind as we talked about 90 days ago with regards to the mainframe cycle. So, we take that into account.
But, the third bucket is around productivity. This is around how you transform the way you work, it’s predominantly led by our services base of business but it’s also about how we reinvent and how we run our company around our infrastructure and enterprise productivity. Both are giving us operating leverage as we move forward. We’re seeing the latter play out in our expense efficiency structure here in the second quarter and in our services base of business we talked about the work we’re doing around our workforce optimization, the significant actions we took in the first quarter. I said, it’s predominantly the yield on that is in the second half. And that should accelerate significantly, but we’re also transforming the way we actually deliver service, redesigning it, applying agile methodologies, infusing AI and automation, and driving a differentiated value to our clients to improve the quality in addition to the efficiency and margin.
And then, finally, the last point which given services is 60% of our business, human capital-based business, you have to generate revenue to generate operating leverage. It’s tough generating operating leverage when revenue is down. And we’re seeing as that revenue trajectory improves and we’re seeing as we play out here in the second quarter returning services back to growth that we’re going to get the operating leverage as we move forward. And that’s what makes us confident in delivering at least $13.80.

The last question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks. Glad, I made it on to the line there. I guess, maybe to start, Cognitive revenue, they’re down in constant currency in the quarter, and as always, there is some amount of transactional business there. But, just help me understand, tampered the growth there? And then, do you think Cognitive can actually grow in the back half of the year because your compare start to get fairly difficult in that business I think in the back half of the year. And then, Jim, just on gross margins, what ‘s leading you to start talking about ‘19, as it was aggregate total IBM gross margins will be flat to stable. And now, it sounds like it’s only in services. So, what’s the degradation in Cognitive or Systems that’s changed that statement on gross margins from a corporate level to only services now?
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay. On each of them -- Amit, first of all, thanks for getting into the queue. It’s good to hear from you, again. But on each of these, I think I answered them already. But, let me just give the synopsis. On Cognitive, we talked about the different dynamics within our portfolio around TPS, which had been growing, leveraging the mainframe cycle, now is more in line with what our expectations are? And in solutions software, we’ve got strength in key strategic areas of our portfolio, analytics, industry verticals, both FSS, in health, in security and IoT. But, we’ve got work to do on modernizing those key three segment areas of talent, collaboration and commerce, and that as those secular shifts move much more aggressively to SaaS, that time to value gets realized over a longer period of time. So, we do see strength in certain components. We’re making investments in others to transform, as I talked about, modernize those offerings. And that will play out over time. But with that said, we’ve done all the work and are driving the acquisition integration synergies, the operational efficiency savings. So, we feel confident, even at this level of revenue, we can drive operating leverage within that business.
And then finally, back to your question on margins. As I talked, first, I think value -- the way we manage this business, values instantiate in the services based business and gross profit margin. Values instantiate in the product based business in pretax income. Because you’ve got to recoup the return on investment of your go-to-market and your development. And I will not say I’m changing, I would say our operating view of the year of our financial model of revenue growth, of profit growth, of earnings per share is exactly the same. The only thing that’s different within that is the FX change in the last 90 days with the significant U.S. dollar appreciation. Now, we hedge, we hedge that mitigates that profit variability, but when you look at currency around the element of the I&E, you see how it plays out differently. And that transparency and credibility is what I feel is important for you and investors to understand, but it has no impact on our bottom line profit contribution and our delivery of our free cash flow and our at least $13.80 for the year. So, thank you, Amit.
With that said, let me wrap up the call, where I started, by saying this was a good quarter and we’re pleased. We had solid revenue growth and profit performance. This reflects the work we’ve been doing to reposition our business in terms of our offerings, our people, the way we work and reinventing IBM. Now, as always, there’s more work to do. And I look forward to continuing the dialogue over the course of the year. Thank you all for joining us on the call here this evening.

Jim Kavanaugh
Thanks, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us. As we wrapped up 2017 and in our Investor Briefing webcast in early March, we talked about the work we’ve done to reposition our business to lead in the high value segments of IT, our differentiated value proposition, and how our financial strategy and model is built to deliver value to our clients and our shareholders over the long term.
We made progress in our financial performance in the second half of last year, and now our first quarter results demonstrate further progress toward our model. So, we’re clearly moving in the right direction. In the quarter, we delivered $19.1 billion of revenue, $2.3 billion of operating net income, and $2.45 of operating earnings per share. And with this start to the year, we continue to expect at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share in 2018.
Our revenue in the quarter was up 5% year-to-year. Without the currency tailwind, our revenue was up modestly, though you’ll see on the chart constant currency rounds to flat. Now turning to profit, our operating gross profit was up 3%, with broad-based improvement in our year-to-year gross margin performance versus last quarter. Our operating net income was up 2% and earnings per share was up 4%. Those are inclusive of a year-to-year headwind from the actions we took in the first quarter to continue better positioning our business for the long-term. I’ll expand on this in a minute, but what you’ll see in the underlying operating dynamics is that we improved our gross margin trajectory, expanded our PTI margin and had solid growth in earnings per share.
Looking at the year-to-year dynamics let me start with revenue. As I said, we’re up 5% at actual rates, with 6% growth in Cognitive Solutions, 4% in Global Business Services, 5% in Technology Services and Cloud Platforms and 8% in Systems.
Let me add some color by segment, and from here on I’ll focus primarily on constant currency performance. Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2% year-to-year, with continued strength in security software and industry platforms, and a return to growth in our analytics revenue. These Cognitive results contributed to growth in our total software revenue for this quarter, with strong transactional performance and continued growth in SaaS. In our services businesses, we had an improvement in our revenue trajectory from last quarter, driven by revenue from the run-out of our backlog. In addition, both segments grew signings this quarter, contributing to double-digit growth in total services signings, driven by cloud content. Our Systems revenue was up 4%, with very strong revenue growth again in IBM Z, and a second consecutive quarter of growth in Power. Our storage hardware revenue declined this quarter. We were disappointed in our storage performance and it contributed to a modest shortfall to our own expectations of IBM’s revenue growth in the quarter.
Our first quarter results reflect much of the work we’ve done to reposition our portfolio and our skills to address the secular trends in the market, led by the phenomenon of data. We’ve been building new platforms and solutions, while modernizing existing ones, embedding cloud and AI into more of what we offer. And so, IBM is now a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company, focused on the high-value areas of IT.
Our strategic imperatives revenue is an indication of our success in addressing these secular trends. Over the last twelve months, our strategic imperatives revenue of $37.7 billion represents 47% of revenue. Our strategic imperatives revenue in the first quarter was up 15% at actual rates, or 10% at constant currency, led by security which was up 60%, and cloud.
Our cloud revenue is now $17.7 billion over the last year, which is up 22% as reported. Cloud growth in the quarter was driven by our as-a-Service offerings and we’re exiting the first quarter with an annual run rate of $10.7 billion, which is up 20% at constant currency. Our cloud success reflects our ability to help our clients run hybrid environments, with our one cloud architecture across public, private and multi-clouds.
The continued scaling of our strategic imperatives, together with focus on efficiency and productivity is contributing to our improved margin trajectory. So bringing it all together, we grew revenue, operating net income and operating earnings per share and improved our year-to-year gross margin trajectory as compared to the fourth quarter.
Before moving to our key financial metrics, we have a few significant items in our results this quarter, so I want to take a minute to walk through these. And I’ll start by reminding you of what we said 90 days ago in our discussion of our 2018 expectations. We said we expected to deliver between 17% and 18% of the full year earnings per share expectation in the first quarter. Our first quarter operating earnings per share of $2.45 is 17.8% of $13.80, so consistent with the range we provided. We said we expected an ongoing tax rate of 16% for the year, plus or minus two points, and that’s excluding discrete items. We also said that just like in each of the last two years, we anticipated discrete tax benefits in the first quarter, and we’d likely take actions that would offset some portion of the benefit.
In the quarter, we took actions to continue the transformation of our business. These actions drove pre-tax charges of about $610 million, with the majority of this in SG&A, and some in cost. First, with the repositioning of our portfolio, we have emerged as a leader in the high value segments of the enterprise IT industry. This requires revitalization of our skills base and this quarter we took actions to further align our skills to these high value areas. And then second, we took actions that will better position our systems cost structure over the long term. In addition, we settled a number of US and foreign tax audits, which drove discrete non-cash, tax benefits of $810 million in the quarter. Let me remind you that this benefit reverses charges that were reflected in prior years.
As always, we’ve included these charges and benefits in our operating results. Today we’ve laid out a year-to-year bridge of our operating earnings per share, isolating what I’ll call these significant items, so that you can better see the underlying dynamics of our business.
Looking at the drivers of our $2.45 of operating earnings per share on a year-to-year basis, we had contribution from revenue growth at constant margin, as well as from operating leverage. The operating leverage was driven by pre-tax margin expansion, mitigated by a higher underlying tax rate year-to-year. A lower share count contributed to growth and then you can see the year-to-year impact of the significant actions, which was a headwind to our earnings per share growth. So this is a good start to the year, and as I said earlier, our underlying operating dynamics show an improved gross margin trajectory, expansion of our pre-tax margin and solid growth in our operating earnings per share.
I want to mention one other item that we discussed in the context of our 2018 expectations. In January, we implemented two new accounting standards, revenue recognition and the presentation of pension costs. The net effect of the two was a modest reduction in our operating earnings per share in the first quarter, with effectively no impact year-to-year. Regarding the implications to revenue, adoption of the new revenue standard had a de minimis benefit to our revenue in the first quarter, and we expect any full-year contribution to be immaterial.
So now let me talk about the key financial metrics for our operating performance, and show you the impact these significant items have on our results.
As I said, our revenue was $19.1 billion, and the year-to-year performance is essentially all organic. From a geography perspective, revenue in the Americas was flat year-to-year. A decline in the US was offset by solid growth in Canada and Latin America, which was led by Brazil. Asia Pacific was also flat. This is a two-point improvement over the year-to-year performance in the fourth quarter. Our Europe revenue trajectory also improved and in fact, returned to growth. We had strong in France and Spain, and while Germany and the UK declined, they had marked improvement in their year-to-year trajectory.
Looking at our margin performance globally, our operating gross margin was down 70 basis points, though that includes a 40-basis point impact associated with the significant item I just mentioned to improve our long-term Systems cost structure. This is good improvement in our year-to-year margin dynamics, driven by mix and productivity, led by services.
Our operating expense was up 9%, driven by currency, and the actions to continue repositioning of our business. Without these, our expense was better by 1%, reflecting a high level of investment, and our continued focus on productivity. As we’ve discussed in the past, when currency helps the top line, it also hurts the expense line due to both translation and the impact of hedging losses. And so, in the first quarter, currency drove five of the nine points of expense growth. And then, a high level of workforce transformation activity drove another six points of expense growth. I’ll also mention that we had a lower level of IP income, which drove two points of expense growth.
Our operating tax rate for the quarter reflects an underlying rate of 16%, as well as the discrete tax benefits of $810 million. The 16% is in line with the range we discussed in January and is up over a point year-to-year. The operating net income was up 2%, and operating earnings per share of $2.45 was better by 4% and those include the year-to-year impact of the significant items.
Looking at the cash metrics, we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $13.3 billion over the last twelve months. That’s nearly 120% of GAAP net income. I’ll come back to the drivers of our cash performance after I walk through each of the segments.
Now turning to our segments, Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2%, as we continue to scale our new platforms and solutions and grow our SaaS offerings. Solutions Software revenue also grew 2% led by offerings in analytics and security. Within analytics, growth this quarter was driven by strong transactional performance. We saw broad-based growth across both our on-prem analytics platforms and our SaaS offerings, as clients look to use their data for competitive advantage. And so from a portfolio perspective, we had continued growth in offerings that allow our clients to better manage their data in hybrid environments like our Integrated Analytics Systems. We also had strong growth in our data science offerings, where we introduced new capabilities that allow data developers to leverage open-source tools in a secure, collaborative environment.
You’ll remember last quarter we talked about the weakness in the data integration space due to new offerings introduced very late in the quarter. These new offerings are resonating with our clients and contributed to growth this quarter.
Also within analytics, we continue to scale our industry platforms. Let me focus this quarter on Financial Services. Watson Financial Services had another strong quarter, led by Promontory’s Risk and Regulatory business, as well as our Financial Crimes portfolio. We’re seeing a real synergy opportunity in combining Promontory’s industry expertise with our AI technologies. Watson remains the AI platform for business, with continued strong demand for our offerings, particularly around virtual assistants, where conversation service usage increased triple digits year-to-year.
In the first quarter, we introduced several new offerings to accelerate client journeys to AI, such as the enhanced Watson Assistant, with conversational offerings tailored to specific industries like automotive and hospitality. Orange Bank and AutoDesk are two examples of early adopters of our latest technology. And just last week, Forrester recognized IBM Watson Assistant as the only leader in its New Wave report on Conversational Computing Platforms.
Security had great growth this quarter and we continued to gain share. We are well positioned in this market with our extensive security portfolio, which is enhanced with AI to address the needs of our clients. There is obviously a lot of demand here given the important of cyber security risks and data privacy concerns, especially in an environment where security talent is at a premium. We had good performance in areas like data security, with GDPR as a driver, endpoint management and orchestration. And we had strong revenue growth in our SaaS offerings in security, as we continue to increase our AI capabilities across the portfolio.
We also continue to make progress in emerging areas like blockchain. We’ve grown to over 50 active blockchain networks since the release of our IBM Blockchain Platform in the third quarter last year. And last month, we announced a beta version of our IBM Blockchain Platform Starter Plan, designed for startups, developers and companies of any size that want to quickly stand up a blockchain network. In the first two weeks, we had over 750 networks provisioned.
Turning to Transaction Processing Software, revenue was up 1%, so another good quarter. Growth was driven by Z middleware, as our clients continue to invest and growth their high value, mission-critical workloads on the Z platform.
Looking at profit this quarter, pre-tax income for the segment grew 5% and pre-tax margin was roughly flat year-to-year, even with a nearly two-point impact from the workforce actions. Margins were driven by strong transactional performance in high-value areas, offset by ongoing investments into strategic areas and business mix.
Moving on to Services, Global Business Services revenue was down 1% at constant currency, which is a modest improvement in trajectory from the fourth quarter and we again grew signings. Our strategic imperatives revenue reflects the on-going shifts to areas of higher client value, with growth across multiple areas like cloud and analytics.
Turning to the lines of businesses, Consulting revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter and our backlog was up year-to-year. Revenue growth was led by strong double-digit growth in our Digital strategy and ix business, which implements end-to-end digital transformation strategies for our clients. GBS is uniquely positioned to bring together IBM’s first-mover advantage in the most promising, emerging technologies, like blockchain, with their industry expertise, to develop solutions which help clients unlock value.
Looking at Application Management, our revenue was down 2% this quarter, a one-point sequential improvement from fourth quarter. Application Management signings grew at a double-digit rate, as we leverage our incumbency to help clients modernize their critical applications and migrate to the cloud.
Turning to profit, GBS gross margin stabilized this quarter, a two-point improvement in trajectory from the fourth quarter. This includes about a half-a-point impact from currency. The improvement was driven by productivity, revenue mix and pricing improvements. Pre-tax margin was down three-and-a-half points year-to-year, including an impact of nearly two points from the workforce rebalancing charges. This reflects our ongoing investments in the next generation of offerings, skills and enablement, and the reshaping of our pyramids for each of our core service lines, which will drive operating leverage in the long-term.
Turning to Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we had good execution this quarter, with trajectory improvement in revenue and profit and strong double-digit growth in signings. Revenue of $8.6 billion this quarter was down 1%, representing a three-point improvement in year-to-year performance compared to last quarter.
Signings grew double digits, as clients continue to recognize the long-term value of our offerings and capabilities. At this level of signings growth, the TS&CP backlog trajectory improved two points, with approximately 40% of that backlog now in key strategic workloads. Across the segment, the strategic imperatives revenue grew double digits, and the as-a-service exit run rate for the segment is now $7.4 billion. We’ve got a lot of momentum in our enterprise cloud value prop, and this quarter our cloud signings in Infrastructure Services grew over 40% year-to-year.
Infrastructure Services revenue was flat, which is nearly a five-point improvement from the fourth quarter rate. This was driven by improved revenue from backlog realization, as expected. We are helping clients drive efficiencies and gain agility in their IT environments through hybrid cloud. Our clients entrust us with their mission-critical foundational systems and rely on us to navigate the complexities of disparate IT environments along with data and regulatory frameworks as they move to the cloud.
Technical Support Services revenue declined 4%, due, in part, to the dynamics of our hardware product cycle. Within TSS, our core multi-vendor support offerings continued to grow. Integration Software grew 1%, with continued growth in SaaS across the portfolio, and the adoption of the new IBM Cloud Private offering, where we now have over 200 clients using the platform. The Integration Software portfolio remains essential to clients as they connect multiple environments through a single architecture.
Turning to profit, gross profit margin for the segment was down 60 basis points year-to-year, a 140-basis point sequential improvement from fourth quarter driven by services where we had productivity and scale improvements, and a better mix within Integration Software. Pre-tax income margin was down three points year-to-year, where, similar to GBS, workforce rebalancing charges had a two-points impact. Adjusting for this, the pre-tax income margin dynamics were consistent with our gross margin dynamics.
In Systems, revenue grew again this quarter as we modernized our systems for the most contemporary workloads. Performance was driven by both strong z14 momentum and growth in Power, mitigated by the decline in Storage. This quarter, IBM Z grew 54% year-to-year on more than 100% growth in shipped MIPS and margins expanded. The z14 adoption was again broad-based. We added new clients to the platform across several countries this quarter, including a services provider in Thailand who chose our LinuxONE for its blockchain solutions.
So, we’re continuing to address the emerging workloads across the z platform like blockchain, but also machine learning, dev ops and payments. With new workload MIPS growing four times as fast as our traditional MIPS. And last week, we announced a new z14 designed specifically for cloud environments. Its industry standard, single-frame design allows for easy placement into public cloud data centers and private cloud deployments. These latest systems bring the power of IBM Z to an even broader set of clients. Overall, the mainframe continues to deliver a high value, secure and scalable platform that is critical in managing our clients’ complex environments.
Power grew for the second consecutive quarter, with revenue up 3%, driven by our entry level portfolio and our cloud-enabled offerings. Power remains vital to many workloads, including artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, UNIX, and Linux, and we grew in all four this quarter. We started transitioning to POWER9 in the fourth quarter with the first installment of our supercomputers at US Department of Energy, and late this quarter, we started shipping our POWER9 entry systems designed for AIX, IBM I and Linux workloads. These cloud-ready systems provide leadership capabilities in advanced analytics, cloud environments and data intensive AI workloads.
Storage hardware was down after four consecutive quarters of growth, driven by increasingly competitive environment and continued pricing pressures, though we expanded margins. We also had some sales execution challenges which impacted performance. Remember what we are talking about here is just the hardware element of storage. Clearly, we’ve seen some of the value shift to software. In this quarter, we had strong growth in Software Defined Storage and Cloud Object Storage, which are reported in Transaction Processing Software.
Looking at profit for Systems, gross margin was down about four points year-to-year, including nearly a five-point impact for the charge I referenced earlier in Systems cost. Without that, gross margin expanded due to the relative strength in our higher margin business and cost efficiency actions. Pre-tax margin was roughly flat year-to-year, even with the impact associated with the significant items in cost and expense. So, in our underlying performance we expanded margins, while successfully delivering innovation in support of our clients evolving workload needs.
Turning to cash flow and balance sheet, we had another strong quarter. We generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables and after investing another $900 million in capital expenditures, we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, which is up year-to-year. Our cash realization remains very strong at nearly 120% over the last 12 months. This performance puts us on track to achieve our full year expectation of free cash flow of approximately $12 billion.
Our results in the quarter were driven by performance in working capital, partially mitigated by higher cash taxes and higher CapEx. Both headwinds, we talked about back in January. Looking at uses of cash in the quarter, we returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders, including $1.4 billion in dividends. We bought back almost 5 million shares and had $3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization at the end of the quarter.
On the balance sheet highlights, you can see we ended the quarter with $13.2 billion in cash and total debt was $46.4 billion. About two-thirds of our total debt was in support of our financing business. Our financing leverage remains at 9 to 1, and the credit quality of our financing receivables is strong at 53% investment grade, that’s consistent with December and a point better than a year ago.
So our balance sheet is strong, we’ve got flexibility we need and with a strong quarter in cash flow, we’re on track for the year. So let me make a few summary comments on the quarter and the year before we go to Q&A.
We’ve been building and transforming our portfolio, our skills, our operating model, to address what our enterprise clients need and what they value. Our results over the few quarters reinforce that our clients value the integration of our innovative technologies together with our industry expertise to help them in their journey to AI, their journey to cloud. And they value our approach to the protection of their data and their privacy.
In the first quarter we built on the progress we made in the second half of last year. We improved our year-to-year revenue trajectory in Cognitive Solutions in GBS, in Technology Services and Cloud Platforms. And we continued to grow our Systems revenue. We improved our year-to-year trajectory in operating gross margin, it’s better by 70 basis points compared to the fourth quarter performance and better by 110 basis points when you adjust for the actions we took. The margin trajectory improvement was broad-based with operating leverage coming from mix and from improved productivity. We continued our investments, in our one cloud architecture, in emerging areas like blockchain, and more broadly in skills and talent development. All together, we grew our revenue, operating net income, operating earnings per share and free cash flow.
With this performance we continue to expect to delever at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share, with about 40% of that in the first half. To put that in perspective, that’s about a point ahead of our first half skew in 2017. And so, this was a good start to the year, and going forward, we’re focused on delivering consistent operational performance.
And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia to kick off the Q&A.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So operator, let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Katy Huberty
Jim as you noted Storage was the disappointment in the quarter, can you just talk a bit more about what drove the change in the pricing environment, your execution and some of the actions that you had to take to reposition that business. And then just more broadly can you talk about the expected pay back on the actions that you took in the quarter both in terms of the amount and timing of the return on the workforce rebalancing. Thank you.
Jim Kavanaugh
Katy, thank you for the question. So we’ll go in two parts, let me address storage first. As I stated in the prepared remarks we were disappointed in our storage performance especially after four quarters of growth, our 1Q fell below our own expectations but I’ll tell you we have a great team with a proven track record. This is the same team that has proven that they’ve revitalized the portfolio in the past, took market share for four consecutive quarters and now we had an impact in the first quarter predominantly just due to execution of transactions at the end of the quarter. This market in storage is continued to be very competitive and very aggressive. It is a battle right now on market share, but we feel comfortable that we’ve got new portfolio offerings that are coming out later in the year, as we get through the latter half of second quarter and then to third quarter and fourth quarter and we’ve already taken significant actions on how our routes to market and our economic equation will all of our channel partners are put in place and with that great team that has executed in the past. We have all the confidence in the world that we can get our storage business back to where it needs to be as we move forward in the second half of 2018.
Now let me talk about your second question because as you stated, there are lot of dynamics that have played out this quarter. Many of which we talked about 90 days ago, so let me spend a couple minutes to unpack this because I think we should spend our time on fundamental underlying business performance when you take a look at our significant items that I talked about. So in January during our guidance, we talked about we would have a tax discrete and in this quarter and as I stated, it was $810 million. As I stated, the largest driver of this was the conclusion of the 2013 and 2014 US IRS audit. And I’ll remind you this reverses provisions previously taking in our tax rate in prior years and it’s non-cash. So in addition to that, we took actions around continuing to reposition our business to revitalize our skill base, the higher value [indiscernible], our systems cost structure over the long-term and as we continue to look for ways to make a more variabilized [ph] model versus fixed cost model. So as always we included the charges and the benefits in our operating results. But in order to understand the underlying dynamics and some of you have given me very good advice, we put in place a year-to-year bridge of our operating’s earnings per share to show you the implication of the net effect of those two events on a year-to-year basis.
And as you saw in the chart, it was a headwind to us of $0.05 that we owe, had overcome. So without those impacts we improved the trajectory of our gross margin, our gross margin was down 30 basis points in my books that’s stabilization, we expanded our pre-tax margin, we had solid earnings per share growth and free cash flow growth and we delivered what we said in the quarter. Now in turns of savings, just wrapping it up, as you see we took about $610 million action to continue repositioning our business, we expect that to deliver 2x the investment and maybe a little bit more, on an annualized basis and we expect about half of that to be driven in second half of 2013. So I’ll tell you when you cut through it and you look at that operating earnings per share bridge year-to-year, we are focused on delivering consistent, operational performance in this business to deliver value to our clients and our shareholders as we move forward.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Katy. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi
So Jim, you had talked about growing revenues in the first quarter and you fell short of that this quarter with flat revenue growth. You highlighted storage was that really the only area of disappointment in where you thought you were 90 days ago and if we kind of look forward, I suppose critics could say, the IT spending environment is very robust, you’re benefiting from a mainframe cycle, comparisons are relatively easy, isn’t this about as good as it gets and when we look forward, should we be thinking about the high water mark for revenue growth being this quarter or what might change that?
Jim Kavanaugh
Yes, Toni. Thanks for the question. Pretty long question I’ll try to make sure I can answer each component. First of all as you stated, we did post revenue growth $19.1 billion up 5% at actual rates up modestly at constant currency which is you saw in the chart rounds to flat. And as I stated upfront, being transparent we fell short to our own expectations and I talked about storage already and I’m not going to repeat that. We have confidence in the team, we have confidence in the portfolio and we know we’re going to get back on the field and turn that business back to growth as we get into second half, but let just play out a little of the dynamics of our first quarter in the profile of our revenue. We had strong growth and let’s start with the strategic imperatives which are the signpost, of us capturing the value in the secular shift so we can lead in the high value IT segments moving forward which are instrumental to our overall financial model. Our strategic imperatives were up 15% at actual rates and up 10% at constant currency and on a trailing 12 months we’re at $37.7 billion, 47% of IBM. That trajectory if you just play that out, says we’ll deliver our $40 billion signpost before the end of 2018.
Now unpacking that strategic imperative let’s talk about the fundamental drivers of that. One, our Cloud business. Our Enterprise Cloud continues to resonate from a strategy value prop and we’re continuing to gain momentum. Over the last 12 months $17.7 billion of revenue up 22% at actual rates or as a service component underneath that, $10.7 billion that’s up $400 million on an annualized exit run rate just from three months ago and it’s up 20% overall. And security we have a leadership market share position, we’re taking share, we’re up 66%, $3.4 billion. So I would tell you the underlying dynamics of how we changed our portfolio, we’re capitalizing on those secular shifts and we’re gaining market share overall.
Now with regards to IBM’s model as we talked about a month ago, when I spent time with you in Las Vegas at our Investor webcast. Our model is 1% to 3% low single-digit. We have a composition of our portfolio that delivers revenue contribution, operating leverage to deliver that investment thesis of being a high-value base company delivering profit at mid-single-digit and high single-digit earnings per share and delivering free cash flow to deliver 70% to 80% back to our shareholders. So we feel confident that we’ve got the right portfolio lineup, we’re well on pace to deliver that $40 billion earlier than 2018 and we’ve got the right team in place to go execute.
And now, just concluding you asked about disappointments, obviously when you look at our performance we said what we were going to do, we returned cognitive solutions back to growth coming off of fourth quarter flat, it grew 2% at constant currency and we had a great software quarter, return in analytics back to growth, after last quarter we talked about 90 days ago we were disappointed. So great work on that team and we continue to add momentum with regards to our security business and our industry verticals.
Our services business, we talked about 90 days and improved backlog trajectory run out and you could see in our first quarter that has played out. Great improvement TS & CP [indiscernible] constant currency to down 80 points at constant currency and we’re making very good progress, we delivered double-digit signings growth and our backlog improved in TS & CP. GBS, we made modest improvement and that would be the second area that we got to pick up the rate and pace in addition to storage, we did improve the trajectory from down two to down one, we improved our backlog by growing signings again, but our backlog is still down 5%, but our backlog trajectory run out still points to improve in trajectory throughout the year and it should enable us to get to revenue growth in the second half of the year, if we continue to drive the quoted signings, to fuel the backlog, to fuel the revenue, so there’s a lot packed in there but I appreciate the question, Toni. Thank you.
Patricia Murphy
Okay, operator. Can we please go to the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Wamsi Mohan
Jim, you obviously had very strong revenue growth here in the quarter, but the PTI margins are really massed by the impact of these significant items you called out. Can you give us some color on – in the underlying businesses where you saw the most underlying improvement in PTI trends, if you exiled these significant items, some color and the confidence that you expect that this should improve materially from 2Q through the end of the year? And if I could just ask a clarifying question as well, what specifically were the significant items that impacted Cognitive PTI margins. It seemed that you called out the skill base trends for high value areas and Systems cost structure but not quite sure what specifically impacted Cognitive. Thank you.
Jim Kavanaugh
Sure, thank you Wamsi and thank you for the complement. We’re pleased with our performance here in the first quarter and it’s first substantiation as we may continue progress in delivering consistency of operational performance I talked about in 2018, so let me first talk about the clarification question with regards to the significant items. As we talked about, we have repositioned our portfolio over the last couple of years, you know quite well we continue to create new offerings to address new value in the market from a client perspective and we’ll continue to adapt that overall and to compete in that light of business, we got to continuously revitalize our skill base and within parts of our cognitive solution portfolio in particular around areas of talent, collaboration and commerce we’re monitorizing [ph] our set of offerings to address shifts in client value and address shifts in consumption models. And we need to revitalize our skills to compete in that area, so in Cognitive Solutions that was predominantly a workforce remixing, we vitalizing charge that was taking to SG&A.
Now let’s go to your overarching question and talk about what we see with regards to the fundamental trajectory of our business. And yes the question in terms of our pre-tax margins and how it’s distorted and that’s why I’m glad Katy asked that question upfront because I think we got to get clarity on the underlying dynamics and the fundamentals of our business existing first quarter, so let me just take a minute by each segment because I think each segment should be looked at little differently, from a gross profit margin perspective, it is very appropriate to look at your services based to businesses just given the overarching cost structure and how you drive utilization and return on investment in a cost of service delivery model. So in services I’ll talk gross margin, but I’ll start with Cognitive Solutions.
Cognitive Solutions, our model is a model that looks at PTI margin expansion because our model is to deliver single-digit or mid single-digit revenue growth and mid single-digit pre-tax growth i.e. no operating leverage. And when you take a look at our first quarter performance all in printed charges we delivered revenue growth at actual rates at 6%, 2% in constant currency and we deliver pre-tax income at 5%. So we’re generated on that constant currency operating leverage and at actual rates, we delivered our model. Now that’s with all the charges in, excluding the charges we delivered 12% pre-tax income growth. So 2X the revenue growth, as we continue to generate significant value out of our high value base offerings and making great progress from where we were 90 days ago.
Now let’s look at our services business, one in GBS. GBS, we improved the trajectory of our gross margin quarter-to-quarter by 200 basis points and that is all the great work that GBS teams are doing all around the world, around driving mix and value out of whole new set of offerings. Our SI business has greater margins than our core business and you know almost two-thirds of our GBS business is now in SI as we continue to generate momentum with double-digit growth. But also we’re seeing price margins in our signings every quarter going up two to three points.
Now we got a lot of work to do and we’re driving that work around workforce optimization productivity. Mark talked about refining our skill pyramid and getting the utilization and infusing AI and automation to improve delivery to go realize those margins and we’re starting to see some improvement and we fully expect that trajectory to continue as we move into second half. Now TS & CP, TS & CP improved their gross margins which is the right way of looking at that business as we invest in our cloud to build out our leadership capability and we continue to drive the effective utilization of our GTS business, we improved our margins almost 150 basis points from fourth quarter. We printed down 60 basis points. So we made substantial trajectory improvement that is being driven based on continued scale efficiencies with our cloud momentum and as a service business, but it’s also being driven by the tough work in redesigning our delivery models, infusing automation, the IBM service platform with the Watson now covers over 1,250 clients and we’re scaling that every single day and we’re driving actions around our workforce optimization and structure. So great trajectory improvement in our GBS and our GTS and we fully expect that continue to move forward in second half and we expect our services margins to be accretive in the second half, not just talking about trajectory improvements.
And then finally in Systems, our systems we repositioned our portfolio through continuous reinvention of our platforms and capitalizing on secular shifts and new workloads. We had good growth in the quarter, our margins were down but that was driven based on the charge we took to better position the long-term structure of our systems business ex-that charge our margins were up and they were up in almost every segment of that business, so thanks Wamsi for the question.
Patricia Murphy
Okay, let’s go to next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Your line is now open.
Steve Milunovich
I just wanted you to indicate whether you expect to see and the 16% tax rate reported the balance of the year or rather you think there will be further discretes. And similarly are we done with workforce balancing charges for the year.
Jim Kavanaugh
Thanks Steve for the question. As we discussed 90 days ago, we said that we would expect into 2018 that our ongoing underlying operating tax rate will be in the range of 16% plus or minus two points before discrete. I would tell you that still remains today, we executed on what we disclosed 90 days ago but expected tax discrete in the first quarter. But as you know these tax discretes by definition they’re unknown in timing and in scope. And we’re continuing to drive the tax optimization as you would expect of us because it’s a critical element of our underlying operating leverage in our company and our financial strategy, but right now I would fully expect 16% plus or minus 2% and as we move forward. And one last thing consistent to what I said 90 days ago is that on a full year basis, all in, we still expect tax to be a headwind.
Patricia Murphy
Okay, good. Let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Tien-tsin Huang
Just wanted to dig into the Services a bit, with the signings that was encouraging. It sounds like signings were double-digit in some key areas including app [ph] and maintenance. It sounds like you mentioned price margin was also [indiscernible]. So I’m just trying to reconcile the signings commentary with the actions to reposition, the workforce rebalancing which I presume will include services headcounts. So are you going to see any negative revenue impact from the actions on the services side, again just trying to reconcile the actions and the potential revenue loss with the strong signings and what it means for the outlook? It got to make sense.
Jim Kavanaugh
Tien-tsin, thank you very much. Yes we were definitely pleased with our signings performance in the quarter as I indicated, we delivered over $9 billion of signings up double-digits and up across each of our businesses and that has positioned our backlog now at $120 billion and that’s up 4% and I would argue 4% at actual rates is right way looking at backlog because that’s what’s going to play out as time goes on at current spot rates. So we’re pleased with that overall, but the underpinnings when you get underneath signings and backlog. In GTS, we grew signings 20% year-over-year with over 40% in cloud and in our infrastructure services our outsourcing business backlog is now about a point better than where it was a quarter ago and we improved our overarching GTS backlog quarter-to-quarter and as I talked about March 8 at the Investor Day webcast. Remember we’ve kind of held our outsourcing backlog pretty consistent over a decade and now we change and capitalize on the secular shifts and about 40% of that underlying backlog now sits in strategic imperative areas of which cloud makes up the biggest piece and the other important point around signings I will talk about is, when you look at the good growth in signings we had in the first quarter, over 40% of that was driven by cloud based signings. So we’re capitalizing or winning and we’re improving the trajectory of our business.
Now let me talk a little bit about margin because I spent on the last answer. The substantial trajectory improvement we saw quarter-over-quarter 200 basis points in GBS and 150 basis points in TS & CP. The way I like to look at these margins as we spent the last two earnings calls, I look at the fundamental drivers of how you operate that business both from a human capital base perspective you got to drive scale efficiency, you got to drive mix through value and price, you got to drive productivity, your fundamental human capital and then as you get operating leverage, you should be able to get, growth through operating leverage. So [technical difficultly] work to do going forward but based on the trajectory and the actions we took to reposition our business that makes me comfortable stating that in the second half our services margins will be accretive.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Tien-tsin. Let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani
I guess Jim if I get maths right, adjusted [indiscernible] one time items gross margin were down 30 basis points in the March quarter. could you just walk me through what do you think are the top [indiscernible] things levers that can help you grow from gross margins declining in Q1 to essentially achieving a stabilization for calendar 2018 that should have implied margins [indiscernible] go up for the next three quarters including Q3 where I think it compared to get [indiscernible]. So what are the [technical difficulty] that give you confidence margins can improve for the remainder of the year?
Jim Kavanaugh
So let’s talk about this. So again guidance of maintaining at least the $13.80 and as we talked about, there is always many scenarios – team, we drive them like crazy here in a very sharp period of time to get ready for this call, but we look at the trajectory of our business, we look at all of your operational indices and that positions how we can triangulate around the guidance that we give externally across our financial model strategy we talked about in Investor Day. Revenue contribution that is growth mix scale and around operating leverage that is productivity and that is as we get that growth what’s that operating leverage we’re going to get on human capital. So it positions both top line and around margin, so let me just give you a perspective of what we see underpinning the $13.80 in terms of gross margin. 1Q as you talked about we printed all in down 70 basis points. If you exclude the significant items so that you can understand the underlying trajectory of our business going forward our margins were down 30 basis points, that’s coming off fourth quarter being 140, in my book that’s stabilization that’s what we guided to in first quarter and that’s what we delivered.
Now with that trajectory improvement that we saw being base of a cost continuing to get scale, continue to get improvements and productivity which we miss by the way, if you remember our discussions 90 days ago and around mix, we do see that trajectory improvement to move forward, but our full year guidance only requires stabilization of margin. And the actions we took in the first quarter I will tell you positions us better than what I said here 90 days ago. On how we can deliver the fundamental dynamics across multiple scenarios of delivering at least at $13.80 and if you play out those drivers since you asked. First, we’re going to continue to invest capital to build out our enterprise cloud and build on that momentum and as a service and we’re going to continue getting scale efficiencies. We made significant investments historically that is been a headwind to us and we are minimizing that headwind every single quarter as we get scale efficiencies and I expect that to continue. Second as I just talked about the increased yield and services productivity, we expect that to play out. Workforce optimization, mix of higher value and capturing price, infusing AI and automation on our deliver platforms. We expect that to play out and deliver significantly in the second half.
Now both of these pieces, the efficiency and the productivity and scale out are required because we all know as we enter the second half we have a significant headwind on mix because we’re not counting on more than a typical mainframe cycle. Our mainframe, we’re very pleased with the performance so far program the date, were above our prior program, we’re capitalizing on secular shifts with the value of our pervasive encryption and blockchain, but it would not be prudent right now to predict or to predicate our $13.80 guidance on breaking a mainframe cycle so that mixed headwind is facing us in the latter half of 3Q and 4Q and we need to overcome it with the scale out efficiencies and with the increased productivity and based on the actions we took in the first quarter, to better reposition our business for the long-term. I feel more confident than I did 90 days ago.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Amit. Let’s go to the next question please.

Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Mark Moskowitz
Just continuing that thread in terms of trying to understand how the revenue component would help drive that margin expansion of the overall equation. Is there any – you can give us in terms of how we should think about the legacy outsourcing business that IBM almost three and five and seven-year outsourcing deals that were consummated before IBM became a bigger and better cloud vendor in the last couple of years. Is there any sort of cycle forthcoming whereas those deals unwind we could see conversion or transition to more like cloud like workloads for those customer and therefore you achieve better scale at your 58 data centers, is that since like it happened this year or it’s something more 2019 or 2020?
Jim Kavanaugh
Thank you, Mark. I appreciate the question. I would tell you we’re seeing that already. I mean the secular shifts that have happened in the market place and are happening and will continue to happen are right in front of us and that’s why I thought it was very interesting and why we shared some of the signpost data about our outsourcing composition and our backlog and how we’ve been able to maintain it over a decade long period while continuing to capture those secular shifts in cloud. Today as we exit first quarter total backlog of $120 billion, our outsourcing backlog is somewhere around that $80 billion number and within that our shift to cloud is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% to 30% already that is providing us tremendous scale efficiency as we leverage in the 58 and actually I think now we’re north of 60 cloud data centers around the world and we’ll continue to differentiate ourselves as we move forward. So we have been focused, I think it’s in attestation to the value of incumbency, the value of trust and we talked about the differentiators about our innovated technology, about our deep industry expertise and about the trust and security of our clients, our GTS business are managing the critical workflows and critical business processes of our clients and as they looked for efficiency in delivering a new model around cloud, we’re actually capitalizing on that as we move forward. So not only it would help our revenue, it will help at the end of the day our margin and our scale efficiencies as we go forward.
Patricia Murphy
Okay, we’ve covered a lot of topics today and we’re going a little long, so I’m going to take one last question, please.
Operator
Our last question comes from David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.
David Grossman
So Jim, I’m wondering if you could just follow-up few of the earlier questions, you did a good job of explaining the dynamics by business unit that said, we have this issue of comping [ph] the mainframe cycle later this year and you just stated, we probably should count on it elongated cycle. So are the improving service metrics that you shared sufficient to give you more confidence that these businesses will be sufficiently position to offset those headwinds that will be created by the anniversary cycle whenever it may happen and then just secondly, a point of clarification. Should we expect the margin benefits from the significant items to benefit both the second half of this year and the first half of next year on a year-over-year basis?
Jim Kavanaugh
Okay, David. Thank you very much for your question. So let me address the second one first because I think that’s a short answer. As I stated both in the prepared remarks and the Q&A we expect the annualized savings to be 2X the investment we’d get about half in the second half so obviously yes that also strategically positions us for the first half plus going forward into 2019 because remember we took these actions to better reposition our business for the long-term and what’s required to continue to generate and create client value and shareholder value as we move forward, so that’s the first question. The second, that’s why I specifically with regards to your wrap around fourth quarter mainframe etc. that’s why I specifically walked through the margin dynamics of what we see playing out throughout the year. We realize and I think it’s prudent based on what we’ve done with our guidance of at least $13.80 we know we got a mixed headwind. Now believe we got in entire mainframe team in 170 countries around the world that are driving like crazy to deliver the value to our clients to make this a secular shift versus cyclical, we’ll put that aside for right now that’s for tomorrow, as we go drive the operational execution being 17 days already into the second quarter. But we do see scaled efficiencies based on the momentum trajectory of our cloud business and as the service, we see productivity played out very nicely for us in the first quarter and with the actions we took in the first quarter, it positions us for the second half as we move forward to get our services business to accretive margins to help us overall and lastly, when you take a look at it, we return our cognitive solutions back to revenue growth to our top line that carries high profit, high value based activity, we expect that trajectory to continue and again that backlog run out is playing out and we got to just continue to drive the signings, to few of that backlog to get revenue on the second half and we feel comfortable with that.
Now with that, let me wrap up the call. By again saying, we’re very pleased with the start of the year. We gave you guidance 90 days ago. We said we’d deliver at least $13.80, 17% to 18% we delivered at the high end of that earnings per share guidance of 17% to 18%. We made substantial progress across many parts of our business. We took significant actions to reposition the long-term position of our company and we are on track to deliver our full year objectives of at least $13.80 and deliver revenue growth at current spot rates, stable margins which is all we need to deliver that $13.80 and free cash flow of at least $12 billion. The first quarter was in [indiscernible] of that, we delivered revenue growth, we delivered operating profit growth, we delivered free cash flow growth, we delivered earnings per share growth, all in. and that positions us now as we’re focused, as I’ve started this call on delivering consistent operational execution in this business as we move forward. So thank you all for joining the call.

James Kavanaugh
Thanks, Patricia, and hello to everyone on the call today. As a quick introduction, I've been with IBM for 21 years. I was the IBM Controller from 2008 through January of 2015 when I became the Senior Vice President of Transformation and Operations where I've been focused on driving IBM's operating model transformation. In October of last year, I came back to be Senior Vice President of Finance and Operations. I participated in IBM's annual investor briefings for the last 10 years and have met many of you. I'm now looking forward to working more closely with the investment community as IBM's CFO.
Given I'm a week into the new role, Martin is going to cover the fourth quarter, and then I'll put into context our 2017 performance and how that positions us for 2018. We'll then take the Q&A together.
So for now, I'll turn it over to Martin.
Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Jim. Back in July, we planted the flag for our businesses, and we pointed to an improved trajectory in the second half. Now as we look back on the year, we did, in fact, significantly improve the trajectory in our revenue and our gross margin performance. We did this by ramping our cloud and as-a-service offerings by continuing to reinvent our systems brands, by driving a higher level of software transactional revenue and by improving consulting performance.
In the fourth quarter, we returned to revenue growth. Our revenue of $22.5 billion is up about 3.5% and up 1% without the currency tailwind. We also grew our operating net income and our operating earnings per share. As you saw in our press release, our operating net income and EPS exclude a one-time charge associated with the enactment of tax reform because of the unique nature and to provide comparability to the operating expectations we've been providing for 2017. For the year, we delivered $79 billion of revenue, $13.80 of operating earnings per share and free cash flow of $13 billion, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year.
Looking at some of the revenue dynamics of the fourth quarter. Our systems results were terrific across IBM Z, Power and storage. This was our first full quarter with the z14. And with pervasive encryption and the ability to address new technologies like blockchain, we're adding new clients and new workloads to the platform. in Cognitive Solutions, we had good growth in several areas, including security, IoT and our industry-based solutions like Watson Health and Watson Financial Services, though we were disappointed by the performance in a few of our more traditional analytics offerings. And in Services, we had our second consecutive growth in consulting, led by digital offerings. Performance in our outsourcing businesses across GTS and GBS was pretty consistent with the last few quarters.
From a geographic perspective, we had growth in many countries, including our 2 largest, the U.S. and Japan. Across all of our businesses, our strategic imperatives revenue was up 17% or 14% at constant currency as we embed cognitive and cloud into more of what we offer. For all of 2017, Strategic Imperatives revenue was up 11% to $36.5 billion, which is 46% of our revenue. I should mention that we'll continue to focus on constant currency revenue growth rates throughout, but any way you look at it, this was a strong finish to the year.
We introduced the Strategic Imperatives framework back in 2015 as a way to show how we're moving our clients to the future. As you know, these aren't separate businesses but the revenue from our offerings that address opportunities in analytics, cloud, security and mobile. This quarter, the 14% growth in Strategic Imperatives revenue was led by cloud and by security. Let me give you a little more on each.
Our cloud revenue was up 27% as we help our clients to implement hybrid environments, integrating public and private and traditional IT. For the year, our cloud revenue was $17 billion, and we're exiting 2017 with a run rate in our as-a-service offerings of over $10 billion. To put that $17 billion in perspective, it's up from $7 billion just 3 years ago. As you know, we play an important role in running our clients' most critical processes. And now with the IBM Cloud, which is built for the enterprise, each of the 10 largest global banks, 9 of the top 10 retailers and 8 of the top 10 airlines are cloud-as-a-service clients. We can help clients with their hybrid environments as well. With introduction of IBM Cloud Private, we provide clients with the attributes of a cloud behind their own firewall and give them increased portability of workloads across any cloud environment. This is really important for enterprise work.
And then in security, revenue across our security offerings more than doubled. This reflects the strong demand for our pervasive encryption in IBM Z as we reinvent that platform for the most contemporary workloads. We also had good performance in managed security services within our GTS business and in our security software. Over the last several years, we've been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into more of what we offer and building new solutions and modernizing existing ones. These investments not only drive our Strategic Imperatives revenue performance today but will also extend our innovation leadership into the future. I'll give you a few examples.
In the third quarter, we formed a partnership with MIT to create the MIT-Watson AI Lab. Through this partnership, we're mobilizing the talent of more than 100 AI scientists, professors and students to carry out fundamental AI research and drive scientific breakthroughs that unlock the potential of AI. In Quantum, we now have a 20-cubit IBM Q system available for all to use, and we have the first working 50-cubit processor, and we launched the Q Network, which is a collaboration of leading Fortune 500 companies, academic institutions and national research labs that can access IBM Q systems through the IBM Cloud as they explore the practical applications to advance quantum computing. And you saw just last week, we announced that IBM led the U.S. in patents in 2017, marking our 25th consecutive year at #1. Nearly half of the more than 9,000 patents in 2017 are for advancements in AI, cloud computing, cyber security, blockchain and quantum computing.
So now let me move on to our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue was $22.5 billion, which, as I said, is up year-to-year. Like last quarter, our performance is pretty much all organic. I'll go into the highlights by brand in the segment discussions, so let me comment here on the geographic performance.
Revenue from the Americas was up 4%, with growth across the U.S., Canada and Brazil. This is a significant sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance, 6 points compared to the third quarter, driven by systems and infrastructure services. Our EMEA revenue was down about 1.5%, which is consistent with last quarter's performance. As always, the performance varied within the geography. This quarter, we had growth in France, Spain and the Middle East and Africa region, offset by weakness in the U.K., Germany and Italy. You'll remember that the U.K. and Germany were impacted by the contract dynamics at the end of 2016, and we've now wrapped on those. In Asia Pacific, we had strong growth again in Japan, which was up 4%. Impacting overall Asia Pacific performance was China where you'll remember we had double-digit growth last year from some large rollouts in China banks.
Looking at our margin performance. Our operating gross margin was down a little over a point year-to-year and up nearly 2 points sequentially. This is about 0.5 point behind what we talked about last quarter, with some of the differences due to mix and the rest due to a delay in the yield from some of our productivity actions in our Services business.
Our operating expense was up 6%. And with revenue up 4%, our E to R increased nearly 70 basis points year-to-year. Now keep in mind, when currency helps the top line, it also hurts the expense line, not just because of translation but because that's where the majority of the hedges are reported. We mentioned this back in October. And so in the fourth quarter, currency, between translation and the year-to-year impact from hedges, drove 4 of the 6 points of expense growth. We also had a lower level of IP income in the fourth quarter, about $175 million year-to-year, and it was down for the full year about the same amount. At the beginning of the year, we said we weren't counting on IP income being flat year-to-year, though we had the opportunity pool to do so. And as we went through the year, we're delighted with the new IP partnerships we signed. You can see they contributed to the $300 million of IP income in each of the last 3 quarters, and we weren't going to do anything unnatural to drive flat performance year-to-year in this line item.
Without the effect of currency and IP, our E to R improved modestly, reflecting the continued efficiency we're driving in our underlying spend base while maintaining a high level of investment, together with the benefit of growing revenue.
Looking at operating taxes. Again, this excludes the one-time charge. We provided a range for our ongoing tax rate at the beginning of the year, and we finished at the bottom end of the range. And so our tax rate for the quarter reflects an underlying effective tax rate of 12% for the year. You'll recall, we had some discrete items in both the first and the second quarter, which took our full year operating tax rate down to 7%. We generated $4.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter, which is up 1%. And with share reduction of about 2.5%, our operating EPS of $5.18 was better by 3.5%. We generated $6.8 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $13 billion for the year. Now when you look at our realization of GAAP net income, that's over 200%. But when you normalize for the one-time tax charge, it's about 115% for the year. For your awareness, as we show realization of GAAP net income going forward, we'll be using that adjusted view on our charts. Our free cash flow supports both a high level of investment and shareholder returns. And in 2017, we returned 3/4 of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
So now let me move on to the segments. Our Cognitive Solutions revenue was flat. Within solutions software, our annuity content, which represents 80% of revenue on an annual basis, was up 3% year-to-year, which is over a point better than last quarter's growth. We had double-digit growth in our SaaS offerings again this quarter as we continue to invest to build scale in our as-a-service businesses. The transactional revenue within solutions was down, driven by weakness this quarter in a few of our more traditional analytics offerings like data integration and content management. As you know, because of the larger mix of transactional content in the fourth quarter, it has an outsized impact on the overall software performance.
Within our solutions software portfolio, we continue to focus on building out our industry verticals, and we had strong performance in those areas, including Watson Health, Watson Financial Services and Watson IoT offerings. In Watson Health, we continue to deliver strong growth, driven by state and local government agencies as well as life sciences and oncology. Watson Health is scaling. We've reached 115,000 people with our cognitive offerings, and oncology is now in over 150 hospitals and health organizations and trained on 13 cancers compared to 4 cancers just over a year ago. Watson Financial Services had another strong quarter as clients look to evolve their financial systems. Growth here was led by our RegTech and commercial payments offerings.
Also, within analytics this quarter, we had good growth in areas that provide data management in hybrid environments like our new unified data system, which leverages DB2 technology built on IBM Power, and in our software-as-a-service business intelligence offerings, including cognitive analytics. As I said earlier, security contribute to growth again this quarter. We had good performance, particularly in the areas of data security, with GDPR as a key driver as well as fraud detection. We saw increased interest in uptake and our software-as-a-service offerings, particularly with QRadar on cloud and Resilient on cloud. We also continue to make progress in emerging areas like blockchain. Remember that for us, blockchain is a set of technologies that allow our clients to simplify complex, end-to-end processes in a way that couldn't have been done before. It requires the attributes of immutability, permissioning and scalability, and we're already performing thousands of transactions per second. And we offer some of the most advanced cryptography available to verify transactions. So by running on z, we provide industry-leading technology to help improve security and performance for our clients' blockchain networks.
We have engaged in blockchain projects with hundreds of clients, and since the release of our IBM Blockchain platform in the third quarter, we've collaborated on 35 active networks with clients such as CLS, Everledger, KBank, London Stock Exchange and Mizuho. These reflect a wide variety of use cases like cross-border payments and financial services, supply chains in retail, valuable goods authentication in industrials and digital identification for governments. This quarter, we extended our food safety initiative with Walmart into China. And just this week, we announced the creation of a joint venture with Maersk to provide more efficient, secure global trade using blockchain technology.
Turning to transaction processing software. We had another good quarter with revenue up 3%, reflecting our clients' long-term commitment and the value our platform provides to them. Growth was driven by middleware as our clients continue to invest and grow their high-value, mission-critical workloads on the z platform.
Turning to profit for Cognitive Solutions. PTI margin declined year-to-year, driven by ongoing investment into strategic areas and mix of business into lower-margin offerings, including the shift towards SaaS. Our SaaS margins continue to expand, though were still not at scale.
Moving on to Services. Global Business Services generated $4.2 billion of revenue this quarter, up 1% at actual rates and down 1.5% at constant currency. We had modest growth in GBS signings, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of signings growth. And our GBS revenue was up in several regions, including Asia Pacific and Latin America. We have good momentum in Consulting but continue to see declines in Application Management, particularly in North America and Europe.
Consulting revenue grew 1% again this quarter. We've said for some time that the path to revenue growth starts with signings, which then translates to backlog growth. Our Consulting backlog was essentially flat in the second quarter and was up starting in the third. And we've now driven 2 consecutive quarters of Consulting revenue growth. 
Revenue in our Digital Strategy and iX business grew about 40%. And we're also seeing good growth in the new practices we've built around our innovative technologies like AI and Blockchain. The reason we're able to lead in these emerging areas is because of the technology as well as our ability to implement these platforms into our clients' workflows. So GBS plays a critical role on our leadership in these areas. This doesn't apply just to our own technology. We're also building ecosystems and partnerships around other platforms. We've talked in the past about Salesforce and Workday. And now in December, we announced a partnership with Blue Prism that will combine their robotics processing automation software with IBM services to deliver digital workforce solutions that increase productivity and enable automation at scale. Application Management was down 3% this quarter, driven by declines in traditional ERP managed services and the successful completion of some large contracts. Within Application Management, we grew in our offerings that help clients modernize their critical application suites by implementing cloud-centric architectures and microservices.
Turning to profit. GBS gross margin was down about 2 points year-to-year. Half of this was due to currency dynamics this quarter, and it impact margin by about a point. We're also continuing to invest in our skills and transform our GBS business. As Mark Foster talked about at our investor briefing, our strategy is focused around digital, cognitive and cloud growth platforms, and we've streamlined their practice model to ensure the right skills enablement for practitioners. We're investing to further develop our long-term client relationships with the leading organizations around the world, both with more dedicated senior account leadership and the reinforcement of delivery excellence through methods, automation and widespread rescaling of our practitioners. We're also bringing in new skills through acquisitions. We closed on the acquisition of Vivant this quarter in Australia, which is the seventh acquisition we've done in GBS over the last 2 years. And in some of the more traditional areas in Application Management, we continue to see some price and profit pressure.
Technology Services & Cloud Platforms generated $9.2 billion of revenue this quarter. Our Strategic Imperatives grew at a double-digit rate, and the as-a-service exit run rate for this segment was nearly $7 billion. The IBM Cloud is optimized for cognitive workloads and provides clients with the ability to integrate public, private and managed environments through a single architecture. Infrastructure services was down 4%, which is similar to the trajectory we've seen in recent quarters. As we've talked about, this quarter, we had a more difficult year-to-year compare because of some of the large contract items a year ago. We've now wrapped on those dynamics. Clients are looking to cloud to drive efficiency and agility in their infrastructure and help them create new business models, but they need help getting there and they need someone to manage it for them, given the complexity of their data, environments and industry.
When you look at the composition of our infrastructure services signings this year, about 45% was cloud content, which is ahead of the market mix.
Integration software was down 5%. Our SaaS revenue was again up at a strong double-digit rate across the portfolio, and we continue to have momentum in our hybrid integration tools that are important to enterprise cloud deployments, but it was not enough to offset the decline in our on-premise tools as more of that portfolio shifts to the cloud.
I mentioned earlier this quarter, we announced IBM Cloud Private, a platform to help clients unlock their significant IT investment in core data and applications and extend cloud native tools across public and private clouds. The new platform was built on an open-source container architecture and supports both Docker containers and Cloud Foundry. This facilitates integration and portability of workloads as they evolve to any cloud environment. IBM Cloud Private was developed in response to our clients who want more control of their data and processes while leveraging cloud capabilities. The need is obvious in regulated industries, but every client has data residency requirements and is concerned with the security and performance of pure public clouds. This platform will help everyone to better implement cloud infrastructure that aligns with whatever business model they have. Since the announcement of IBM Cloud Private, we've already brought 120 enterprise clients onto the platform.
Technical Support Services was up 1% at actual rates and down 2% at constant currency. We grew in our multivendor support offerings, where we drive productivity and scale for our clients with integrated and wall-to-wall support solutions across any platform.
Turning to profit. Gross margin for the segment was down about 2 points year-to-year. Some of the large contract dynamics that we've talked about are impacting margins. There were also new large contracts that came into the portfolio at lower margins as we invest ahead to optimize our clients' environments. We continue to invest to scale our cloud platforms and more of the software content in this segment shifts to as-a-service. We're scaling the IBM Services Platform with Watson, where we've already added over 1,000 clients to the platform in 2017. Additionally, we've wrapped on the benefit from our workforce transformation actions that we took in 2016. We did improve our spending here, but as I mentioned, the yield from some of our productivity actions is delayed.
In Systems, we had another strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth. All 3 brands, IBM Z, Power and Storage, grew. We continue to deliver innovation in our systems to enable them to run the most contemporary workloads. Now roughly half of our Systems revenue in 2017 address workloads in the areas of our strategic imperatives.
This quarter, IBM Z revenue was up 71% year-to-year with the highest shipped MIPS in history. The results reflect our first full quarter of z14 and demonstrate the strong client demand for this platform. Our mainframe is an enduring franchise. In fact, it's an enduring and growing franchise. Our MIPS installed base is up 2.5x over the last 10 years. And as long as we continue to innovate and modernize, this platform will continue to be the leading enterprise platform in the world. More than 10 years ago, it was Linux. 5 years ago, it was mobile. And now, it's pervasive encryption.
The z14 adoption was again broad-based across many countries and industries. We added 14 new clients to the platform across 10 countries this quarter, and we saw especially strong performance in North America where clients continue to leverage traditional IT infrastructure together with the cloud. We're continuing to address emerging workloads across the Z platform like blockchain, machine learning, DevOps and payments. We closed 10 instant payments deals this quarter across several markets. And in the emerging blockchain space, the Beijing Institute of Technology selected the IBM LinuxONE platform to run their blockchain solution. Overall, the mainframe continues to deliver high-value, secure and scalable platform that's critical in managing our clients' complex environments.
Our revenue grew 15%, driven by double-digit growth in our high- and low-end portfolio, with our cloud-enabled offerings serving new clients in deep learning and the HANA markets. We continue to shift into the growing Linux market. And our Linux on Power revenue grew again and gained share. For 2017, this now represents 1/4 of our Power portfolio. We also delivered the first installment of our supercomputers at U.S. Department of Energy, with more to come later in 2018. There are 3 labs of this type, and we won 2 of the 3, which is the most any provider is allowed to win. In this quarter, in our low-end Linux portfolio, we released our next-gen Power system with our new POWER9 processor. These POWER9 systems bring unprecedented speed to AI workloads and enable our clients to compete and win in the data-intensive AI era.
Storage hardware was up 8%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of growth so, obviously, we've got some momentum here. We gained share in a very competitive market while holding margins stable. We had double-digit growth in our high-end hardware products for the quarter, which reflects the demand for flash as well as the capacity increase linked to mainframe demand.
Our all-flash array offerings once again grew at a strong double-digit rate and faster than the high-growth all-flash market. In our storage software, which is reported in Cognitive Solutions and a major contributing to our storage business, had strong revenue from our cloud object storage offerings.
Looking at profit for Systems. Our margin was down slightly year-to-year and up sequentially, consistent with product cycle dynamics.
And so now I'll go quickly through cash on the balance sheet, and Jim will wrap up with the segments in the context of 2018. We generated $7.8 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, excluding our financing receivables. We invested nearly $1 billion in capital expenditures and generated $6.8 billion of free cash flow. For the full year, we generated $16.3 billion of cash from operations, excluding financing receivables. We invested $3.3 billion in CapEx this year, mainly in cloud, in support of our services business. And so we generated free cash flow of $13 billion. And as I mentioned, our cash realization was strong at 116%. That's up 17 points from last year.
You'll recall that we expected our free cash flow to be roughly flat for the year. At $13 billion, we're up $1.3 billion year-to-year so, obviously, we delivered a much stronger number. Relative to what we expected, we were more efficient in the deployment of capital expenditures, which was down about $400 million year-to-year. Additionally, because of the mix of business and the strong working capital performance at the end of the year across collections and our factory program, we drove better cash performance. With that free cash flow performance, we've returned almost $10 billion shareholders, including dividends of $5.5 billion and $4.3 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back over 27 million shares, reducing our average share count by just over 2%. At the end of the year, we had $3.8 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Now looking at the balance sheet. We clearly have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long term. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.6 billion, higher than a year ago as the bulk of our 2018 debt maturities will occur earlier in the year. Total debt was $46.8 billion, of which 2/3 was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business is 9 to 1, and the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 53% investment-grade, a point better than both September and last December. Given that this is the year-end call, I wanted to give you a quick update on our pension plans.
Our U.S. plan has been frozen for some time, and we've been remixing our asset base toward a lower-risk, lower-return profile. At the end of 2017, in aggregate, our worldwide tax qualified plans are funded at 100%, up a couple of points from a year ago, so our plans are in really good shape. We provided information on the performance of our retirement-related plans and year-end 2017 assumptions in the supplemental charts.
So now let me turn it back to Jim.
James Kavanaugh
Thanks, Martin. Let me take a couple of minutes to wrap up. We've been doing a lot of work to reposition our business, to help move our clients to the future, investing, shifting skills and reallocating capital. In short, a lot of heavy lifting. And our results for 2017 reflect that, with an improvement in revenue and our gross profit trajectory in the second half.
Let me make a few comments on 2017 by business and how it positions us for 2018. In Cognitive Solutions, we're driving good results across most of our solutions portfolio, including our Watson and security offerings. Most of these new areas have a software-as-a-service delivery model. And so for 2018, we'll continue to build scale in these as-a-service businesses.
In our Services segments, we've got some momentum in Consulting, driven by our digital offerings and strong growth in our cloud content as we help our clients to build out hybrid environments. As you know, the majority of Services revenue in any given year comes out of the opening backlog. as we enter 2018, the projected revenue from the current backlog points to an improved revenue trajectory in 2018 versus 2017, and that's in both GTS and GBS.
In Systems, we had a great year. Looking to 2018, we have a strong start to our new z14 and are introducing POWER9 systems and have the most competitive storage offerings in some time.
And then across our businesses, our Strategic Imperatives revenue was up at a double-digit rate to $36.5 billion for the year, which is now 46% of our revenue.
So when you take all of this together, we're entering 2018 with a stronger revenue profile than a year ago. In 2018, we'll maintain a high level of investment. This is important as we continue to build out capabilities in AI, in cloud, in security and in blockchain, just to name a few. As always, we'll look for more productivity in our spend base, especially in our Services business, where we'll continue to remix our skills to new opportunities.
And then let me comment on tax. Tax reform provides additional flexibility over the longer term. Our 2018 rate will reflect the implementation of tax reform, which includes a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, offset by the broader tax base and reduced foreign tax credit utilization. This translates to an ongoing operating rate for 2018 of 16%, plus or minus 2 points, which is a 4-point headwind year-to-year. This, as always, excludes any discrete items we will have. Putting it all together, we expect to deliver operating earnings per share of at least $13.80.
I want to briefly comment on 2 other items with respect to our earnings per share expectations. First, regarding the skew of our business. We expect to deliver between 17% and 18% of the full year expectation of at least $13.80 in the first quarter, which is consistent with the average over the last 5 years. You'll recall, the last couple of years, we've had a benefit from a discrete item in the first quarter. We anticipate a potential benefit again this year. And as in the past, we will likely take actions that will offset some portion of the benefit. This is reflected in the first quarter skew. And then second, there are 2 accounting changes that will be effective in 2018 that will affect our results and are included in our expectations. One helps operating earnings per share, and the other hurts. And they essentially offset each other within the $13.80 of operating earnings per share in 2018.
Now looking at cash flow. We had a very strong end to 2017. Martin mentioned a couple of the drivers, which provide some context to our 2018 expectations. We were more efficient last year in the deployment of capital and, in 2018, we're allowing for some growth in CapEx. In addition, we had a strong finish in receivables performance in the fourth quarter, primarily because of the mix of business that creates a year-to-year headwind in 2018. And we also expect a headwind from cash tax payments in 2018. At this point, it looks to be about $600 million year-to-year. Put all of that together, and we expect free cash flow of about $12 billion in 2018, which results in free cash flow realization well over 100%.
So we're building momentum across our business but, as always, more work to do. And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia for the Q&A.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a few items. First, as Jim said upfront, he and Martin will take your questions together. Second, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the full year. [Operator Instructions]. So operator, let's please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan
Jim and Martin, congrats to both of you on your new roles. Jim, your guidance calls for some revenue growth and margin stability here in 2018. And I was hoping you can share some color on the key puts and takes here as it pertains to your EPS guide. Looks like tax is going to be a big headwind, and if you could quantify sort of that in relation to the operational improvement. And if I could, Martin, could you just comment on what drove the decline in Strategic Imperatives and the Cognitive Solutions segment in 4Q, that would be helpful as well.
James Kavanaugh
Okay, thank you, Wamsi. I appreciate the opening question, and thanks for the comment on the job movement. As you can imagine, when we enter any year, there are multiple scenarios around how we position the full year guidance. And in this year, especially given the improvement that we've seen in the second half of 2017, and taking into account that trajectory of our business and all other operational indices, all of this supports our guidance of at least $13.80. Now as I stated in my prepared remarks, let me first start with tax. Our 2018 operating tax rate of 16%, plus or minus 2 points, incorporates the new tax law. This is a 4-point headwind year-to-year compared to our 2017 operating tax rate of 12%. Both of these are before any discretes.
In terms of discretes, like we've had in recent history, we do anticipate some potential benefits from tax discretes. And as in the past, we will likely take action to offset some of those benefits as we always look to position our business for the long term. Taking all of this into account, tax will be a headwind in 2018 year-to-year. Now in terms of the other drivers as you asked. Given our trajectory exiting 2017 and the confidence we have in our portfolio and how we've repositioned it, we do expect revenue growth at current spot rates for 2018. We see stabilization of our margins on a year-to-year basis, driven by the continued scale-out of our cloud business as we drive efficiency, and we're also going to get yield from our services productivity improvements. And this will start in first quarter. And looking at expense, there are many different dynamics here. And I want to make sure we get this right.
We're going to continue to invest at a high level to drive the strategic growth areas while we will continue to deliver our base productivity. And as you saw in fourth quarter, we'll continue to see an expense headwind due to currency hedges. And in terms of IP, we're not planning on any year-to-year profit contribution. We continue to have a strong opportunity pipeline. We believe in this model, and we'll continue to be opportunistic in leveraging the monetization of our IP over the long term. Now let me just conclude on a little bit of color on first quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Martin. In first quarter, as I said, we expect our earnings per share skew to be between 17% and 18%. That is on average of the last 5 years, and it's above the last 2 years. We're maintaining our momentum, as I talked about, but we do see revenue growth, both at actual rate and constant currency, and constant currency similar to fourth quarter. And the annual effective tax rate, as we talked about, we anticipate a potential tax discrete benefit in our first quarter. And similar to last couple of years, we are evaluating potential actions that will offset some of these, and both of these are included in our guidance overall. So hopefully, that gives you a little color, and I'll turn it over to Martin.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, thanks, Jim. So let me give you a little color on Cognitive Solutions for last year. So keep in mind that the majority of our business in Cognitive is annuity-based. And that includes, by the way, the SaaS offerings, which are growing quite well. Where we saw weakness, as we noted in the prepared remarks, was in a couple of traditional analytics offerings like data integration and content management where we either have to go spend some more time getting those offerings better developed, and we did come out with some new wins at the end of the year, but it wasn't soon enough to have an effect in the year, or we're shifting some of those license models to as-a-service. So we don't see a difference in the secular trends, we still believe Cognitive Solutions is going to be driven by the shift to analytics, the shift to cloud, the shift to security. We see that continuing. We just have a couple of offerings here that either we're shifting aggressively or we have to see how the new offerings perform in the marketplace.
Operator
Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi
I'd like to just clarify the guidance, please. You keep talking about a tax rate in 2017 of 12% but, with discretes, it was actually under 7%. And so are you saying you believe that your actual reported tax rate can go from 7% to 16% in 2018 and you can deliver $13.80 in earnings? Or do you know now that you have significant discretes and that your real tax rate that will be reported will be dramatically lower? Because it's very difficult to get the bridge, I think, with the tax rate that's really, in effect, almost 1,000 basis point steeper. And then separately, I'm wondering if you can just comment on the erosion in operating profit margins in both GBS and in Technology Services & Cloud Platforms. The margin erosion there was actually the worst we've seen in history on a pretax basis. That did not appear to be an improvement as you expected. I think, if you back out the tax rate, you actually missed your guided EPS by $0.40 relative to a 15% tax rate. And it all seemed to come from the margin erosion in those businesses. Perhaps, you could address that a little more directly, please.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Toni. It's Martin. I'll give you a couple of points. One, when we gave guidance at the beginning already of last year, we said our tax rate on an annual effective basis would be 12% to 18%, and we came in at the bottom on an annual effective rate. And as you point out, we had a couple of discretes already in the first half, nothing additional in the second, so the printed rate was lower than that, but I don't think that's news. We're trying to be clear, by the way, on tax for next year, so I'm glad you said we're -- you're not quite there yet, so we should spend some more time on it. The annual effective rate going from 12% to 16% is what the headwind that Jim noted. And we do see discretes as we always do. I don't think we've ever had a year where we don't have a discrete in the year. So I would expect there to be discretes. And Jim noted already that we'll have one in the first, which will largely be offset.
So the math that we're talking about from a modeling perspective is 12 to 16. In any case, by the way, the year-to-year headwind in tax is real. We see a headwind in tax. We don't expect at this point at the $13.80 that we'll print a number that we did this year. And again, the 12 to 16 is a good way to do it. The erosion in operating profit, I guess, my view, one, we were looking for a sequential improvement in gross profit. We said both in July, when we said first half to second half, we'd get better; and also, when we talked about it back in January, we said sequentially we'll continue to improve margins. When we got to the fourth, we were up about 2 points. And quite frankly, we thought we could have probably gone to about 2.5 points. And the shortfall there was really driven by 2 things. One is mix. We had a terrific, terrific Systems quarter. And our Systems business is high-margin, but it's not as high a margin as our Software business, so that had an impact on mix.
And then some of the productivity we were looking for out of Services got pushed out. Now that wasn't a huge, huge surprise that the revenue performance in TS & CP to us because we talked about the contracts already. And GBS, we said, as we get consistent, signings growth will get to backlog growth, will get to revenue growth, and we saw a nominal improvement in the revenue trajectory but not enough yet to drive overall revenue growth. But as Jim noted, as we go into 2018, we have a much better backlog.
James Kavanaugh
And we also expect the margin trajectory in both of those businesses to start off and improve as we move forward to the year.
Operator
Our next question is from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty
I appreciate the commentary around the first quarter skew and expecting revenue growth at constant currency in the first quarter. I wonder if you can provide some clarity as well on margin stabilization for 2018. Is that stabilization for the full year? And how would you think the first half versus second half looks like as it relates to year-on-year margin trends?
James Kavanaugh
Yes. Thank you, Katy. This is Jim. So I'll take that. As I stated in my prepared remarks, the skew is 17%, 18% of the full year on EPS, which is on the average over the last 5 years, but it's also above the last couple of years. Embedded in that, we do see the stabilization of margin on a year-to-year basis starting immediately in the first quarter. We entered the first quarter with some good strength, and we feel very good about our portfolio lineup, strength in our transactional businesses coming out of mainframe where we're ahead of the product cycle in the first 2 quarters, we have enclosed the highest fourth quarter shipped MIPS in history, and it's evident that the market has capacity demands and continues to see the value of that platform. So we see very good performance in our Systems lineup. By the way, Power grew, storage grew.
So we had pervasive growth in the fourth quarter, and we feel very strong coming into first quarter. Second, we do see software having growth in the first quarter, and that's just due to the mix between annuity and transactional. As Martin indicated during the prepared remarks, we continue to drive high renewal rates, and we continue to drive the annuity content of our business. And just given the dynamics there, that will give us growth in the first quarter, and it's going to give us mix and margin benefit in the first quarter overall. And then finally, Services, as I stated, we do see revenue from opening backlog, which, in the first quarter, given it's right in front of us, is almost about 90% of the first quarter revenue needed. And it does show improved trajectory throughout 2018. And I'll remind you, throughout '17, we talked about the headwinds we faced in our TS & CP business around some large contract conclusions that was delayed in 2017. We didn't realize it until the very end. We are going to start off 2018 in a much better position on margin, and we see overall stabilization beginning immediately.
Operator
Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani
I guess, maybe I just want to focus more explicitly on gross margins and how you guys think gross margins will stack up in 2018. I know you've talked about margin stabilization, but it would be helpful if you just talk about how do you see gross margins in 2018. And then what are the levers that you think can enable a gross margin expansion environment in '18 for you guys, given the fact you are talking about revenue growth?
James Kavanaugh
Well, if you take a look at 2018 overall -- thanks, Amit -- we expect margins to stabilize, as I said. And we continue to drive -- that's going to come from a couple of areas, one, continued scale of our cloud business; two, improvement in yield of our services productivity as we wrap around some of those completed contracts I talked about; and three, just getting operating leverage from returning this business and portfolio back to growth. So we're going to continue making the strategic investments that are required to position us to win in key growth areas and position this company for the long term. And we're going to drive the base productivity, and we're going to get scale out of our as-a-service business as we move forward. And we saw great instantiation and proof points in the second half of last year overall. 
So if you play that out across our portfolio, I would tell you we'll get mix contribution from our Cognitive Solutions business segment, just driven based on the product lineup and the strength we have in our Watson offerings, in security and in our industry verticals. We're going to get margin and productivity benefit out of our services businesses, GBS and GTS. And we're going to get scale efficiencies out of our as-a-service and cloud-based businesses in our TS & CP overall segment. Martin, if you want to add a few comments.
Martin Schroeter
Yes. The other thing I'd add, kind of the way I think about it, in addition to what Jim went through, one, the margins in our Strategic Imperatives remain higher than the margins in the rest of our business. And remember, the whole business, by the way, has high margins, right? We're a high-margin -- we're a high-value model with high margins, we're 49% -- between 49% and 50% margin. So we're building the businesses. The places we're moving to -- and you saw a great performance out of Strategic Imperatives, the places we're going to offer higher margins than the places we're coming from, and the reweighting alone gets us some content. And as Jim pointed out, in any scale business, the worst is behind us because we're building scale every day.
Operator
Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz from Barclays.
Mark Moskowitz
Just one clarification and a question. Did you guys say that the revenue growth for '18 can grow for full year, both reported and constant currency? And then also wanted to understand more on this topic of scale, which has become the common thread throughout the call today. What are kind of the key metrics that you're looking to that your algorithms internally state in terms of the cloud as a percentage of revenue and also Strategic Imperatives as a percentage of total revenue? What do those need to glide to, to get to greater scale, so you can start talking about incremental operating leverage returning to the story, i.e. 50% gross margin and 20% plus operating margin?
James Kavanaugh
Yes. So thank you, Mark, for the question. So yes, a couple of questions. Let me start with the first one around revenue growth. We did state that based on the trajectory in the second half and how we made significant improvement, and the confidence we have in our portfolio and the strength in winning in key market segments, that we see revenue growth for the full year at current spot rates. I also said that starting in the first quarter, we see revenue growth both at actual rates and current spot rates. Now I will tell you, one, we've got a lot of momentum that we built up through the second half. But 2018, there's a lot of work to get done. We have best visibility of what the quarter we're in right now with the 90 days and all of the operational indices around what the profile of our business looks like, and we're very confident that we will grow at both constant currency and at actual rates. And we got a lot of work to do the rest of the year, and we fully expect that we're going to continue that momentum, and we'll update you as we go through the year on that.
Martin Schroeter
I guess, Mark, it's Martin. In terms of scale, I guess, one way to think about it, because of the backlog of business we have, which it's north of $120 billion of Services business, that business is moving on to the IBM Cloud. That's the process we're going through now. So not only are we building and moving new SaaS properties into the cloud, which have great margins, not only are we building the Platform-as-a-Service and building ecosystems around that, we have 120 -- north of $120 billion backlog in our services business that we're in the process of moving to the cloud. We've got some progress, but we are not through the majority of this yet. We got a long way to go. So when we talk scale, we're moving our whole services platform on to the IBM Cloud, and that's going to give us the scale we need, not just for that infrastructure layer but it's going to give us the scale we need to manage applications, it's going to give us to scale we need to deliver SaaS as effectively as possible and efficiently as possible, so we got a lot of scale coming our way.
Operator
Our next question is from Mr. Steven Milunovich from UBS.
Steven Milunovich
I know you're always excited to hear my suggestions. One would be to provide a bridge, an earnings bridge, which some companies do, and we're obviously all trying to get at that. But it'd be helpful if, at some point, maybe you guys would put one together for us. But a couple of points I wanted to touch on. One would be currency in terms of a bridge, I assume that's positive to EPS. Another is investments. It's very hard to understand. Are your investments increasing year-over-year at a slower rate than they've been? Are they actually declining year-over-year? And then charges. So you're kind of suggesting there's going to be charges that maybe offset some of the discretes on tax. Can you give us a sense of what charges for the year might be like? And there's obviously a lot of speculation about GTS. You're talking about moving things to the cloud, I'm assuming it'd be related to that in part.
James Kavanaugh
Thanks, Steve. I appreciate it. And believe me, as we get to know each other, I'm always looking for suggestions.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, I was going to say, Steve, we only have a thing about multipart questions, not multipart suggestions. We're happy to get those.
James Kavanaugh
You took what I was just going to say.
Martin Schroeter
Sorry. All right, back to you.
James Kavanaugh
Let's start with currency overall. So as you saw in the fourth quarter, currency, finally after -- Martin, how many years?
Martin Schroeter
Too many.
James Kavanaugh
Five years we've been living with this? And it's been a dramatic drain on our portfolio overall just given the dynamics of how much business we do outside U.S. dollar-denominated. But currency is finally a tailwind to the IBM company of a 2.7 points here in the fourth quarter, which was about a $600 million help on the top line. And that's driven from a variety of FX rates across different countries. But as you know quite well, we constantly build a financial discipline in our model, and we hedge those currencies to protect the volatility of our business from the bottom line. And so I would tell you, bottom line currency overall in the period, was de minimis. It was a couple of pennies at most. But what happens is, over the long run, it allows you flexibility to change your pricing, change your sourcing, change your business dynamics. And we've been dealing with that, as I stated upfront, for quite a period of time. And we're glad that it's finally going our way, and we're going to capitalize on that as we move forward.
Operator
Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.
Tien-tsin Huang
I guess, just a couple of quick ones, if you guys don't mind. I know you got a lot of questions around the stable margin outlook. How much of that is coming from expected productivity versus mix and changes in investments? And the second one, just to better understand the tax point here. Just is your capital allocation going to change at all? I heard a little bit about the CapEx, which makes sense, but just wanted to make sure, any change in assumption around capital deployment posttax?
James Kavanaugh
Okay, thank you, Tien-tsin. This is Jim. Let me address the margin piece. As we've been talking throughout the call, obviously, we've got a lot of focus on, one, returning this business back to revenue growth; and two, stabilizing these margins year-over-year. And we firmly believe and are confident that we got the plans in place overall. But when you look at it, I tend to look at margin in a couple of different buckets, as I stated earlier. Number one, we will continue to drive base productivity out of this business. It's instrumental to our financial model, and it's what our clients require as we continue to help our clients move and apply technology and expertise to help enable their businesses to move from one era to the other. And that will be probably about 0.5 point improvement in our margins overall.
On the flip side, we're going to continue to invest in our business to position us strategically, to win in key growth segments. I talked about AI, I talked about cloud, I talked about security in new eras -- areas, excuse me, like blockchain, which you saw a couple of days ago our latest announcement with Maersk around global trade distribution and how we're building and scaling that platform overall. So we're going to continue making investments. And then the third part of the equation is the mix equation. And that's going to come off of driving revenue growth in high profitable areas around our Cognitive Solutions area, and that will drive operating leverage to the IBM company overall. So Martin, you want to address the tax side?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. So a couple of things, Tien-tsin. First, we've been supporters of, proponents of and pushing for fundamental tax reform for a long, long time. We think it's the right thing to go. So we're delighted, absolutely delighted, that we got tax reform. Now in the short term, we took a charge, this toll charge, right, to recognize a shift from one system to the territorial that we've all been supportive of. So we'll pay the toll charge. And as Jim noted, within our cash flow guidance, we have a cash headwind, which is all captured -- cash tax headwind, all of which is captured in the guidance. But for us, it's a long-term benefit because we now have freedom of capital movement. It's not really a near-term capital allocation issue for us. So we have -- well, as you know, we have $12 billion of cash around the world. We don't have big cash pile stock -- cash stockpiled outside the U.S. We've always had a really good access to our cash. And we got tax reform done, or they got tax reform done in a period where it wasn't an issue for us, so no capital allocation changes for us.
The reason we're able to grow the dividend over time, the reason we're able to reduce the share count is because we've always had good cash flow, we've had enough to reinvest in the business. But tax reform by itself -- well, again, not -- we are huge supporters, we're glad it happened, not a near-term capital event for us.
Operator
Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia from Pivotal Research Group.
Louis Miscioscia
Okay, great. I'll ask a question just on Systems, but maybe, as everybody else, a multipart. I just want to look at Systems. Obviously, nice that you have the mainframe cycle. Could you give us an idea how long that could last, in that usually, you get at least 2 nice quarters of it, maybe even 3? And then also on the storage front, obviously, you've been doing very well there. Is your mix more over -- well over 50% or 60% all-flash, so we could expect a good year from that? And then finally, you came out with an AI chip, POWER9. Does that fall into the systems sector? And do you have any traction with that yet, given there's obviously a lot of discussion about AI?
James Kavanaugh
Thank you, Lou. I appreciate the question. And believe me, we are very pleased with our overall Systems performance here in the fourth quarter, and that goes well beyond mainframe. But let me start with mainframe. Very pleased, as I said, with the performance as it instantiates how we continually modernize and build an enduring platform. Strong value proposition, it's definitely resonating in the marketplace, and we continue to handle mission-critical workloads and also, very, very important, open up new profit pools with our pervasive encryption capabilities, getting strong resonation in the market, our new workloads around Linux and HANA and also emerging workloads like Blockchain. So mainframe, with the second quarter, and we had a couple of weeks here in September, we delivered 71% revenue growth at constant currency, and we had the largest shipped MIPS in any quarter in its history.
And now our MIPS installed base has grown double digits year-to-year, and it's 2.5x the last 10 years. So this performance is, right now, above the prior cycle and consistent with z12 a few years ago. And while we've got many scenarios -- as I said earlier, we gave a guidance of at least $13.80, we got many scenarios and many people working tirelessly to continue to drive innovation into this platform so we can do much better than just the typical cycle. Our guidance is not counting on any material change to that. Now I'm glad you brought up Power and storage because we were very pleased in the fourth quarter. Power grew 15%. We started shipping the first POWER9 architecture with the Cora win. I think we won two of the three. We're only able to win two of the three, by the way.
So a strong start to POWER9 architecture, and we'll roll the rest of that out, our low-end, starting later in the first half and early in the second half. So we look for continued momentum in our Power portfolio overall. And then finally, on storage, this is the first year in a long time, for 4 quarters in a row, we've grown storage. And that's been based on the great work our storage team has done about repositioning their portfolio, leveraging and growing share in flash, but it's also about software-defined and also, more importantly, as we move forward, object storage that will continue to look for growth. So we're very pleased with our system portfolio, and we look for that to continue. Martin, do you want to say a few words?
Martin Schroeter
I guess, Lou, it's an interesting question. I guess, since it's only about Systems, it doesn't count as multipart. But we get questions, as I'm sure you do, this idea, what's cyclical, what's secular. And when we go back to why we started talking about the Strategic Imperatives, those are the secular changes in the enterprise IT world. They're all about cloud, they're all about security, they're all about analytics, they're all about mobile. And while what you asked about was a product view, remember that the secular trend that these are tied into continues. And so the demand for mainframe is driven by the secular trend for security. It is not so much about, like, there's a new mainframe, so I have to buy one. It's not so much in POWER9 that, Oh, there's a new POWER9. I have to buy it. All of these machines -- and we kind of shorthand it to say they're built for the most contemporary workloads. But we introduced those shifts and those secular ideas through the Strategic Imperatives, and all of these offerings are riding that secular trend. Mainframe and security is a good example. Power and analytics -- POWER9 and analytics is a good example. And quite frankly, and Jim mentioned this, storage, as it moves to the cloud, needs object store. And our object store offerings in storage are doing terrifically well. So the cyclical versus secular is not as simple as some want to portray it, it really is, are these offerings tied into those long-term secular trends, and our Systems business is absolutely tied to those.
Operator
Our next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider
Welcome, Jim, and congratulations, Martin. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit of color on a constant currency basis for the revenue outlook, and which of the segments' constant currency you would expect to be up versus any that you expect to be down?
James Kavanaugh
Okay, thank you, Jim, for the question. As I stated before, our full year guidance of at least $13.80 is predicated on us delivering revenue growth at current spot rates. I said that earlier because we got a lot of work to do. And while we've got great momentum that we built out in the second half, and we feel very confident about our portfolio across the board, the best line of sight that we have right now is first quarter. And in first quarter, we will deliver revenue growth, both at actual rates and at constant currency. And let me just give you a little color underneath that. If you start with Cognitive Solutions, as Martin said earlier in one of the Q&As, we have repositioned through strategic investments in many different areas that portfolio and have been generating tremendous penetration in our annuity content. Today, in Cognitive Solutions, annuity is about 80% of that portfolio. And underneath that, it's being driven by a strong acceleration in Software-as-a-Service in the mix.
Over the last 12 months, our Software-as-a-Service is up 30% overall. So we see, just based on the annuity versus transactional seasonality of first quarter, we will grow Cognitive Solutions at a constant currency level. In both of our services areas, which, as we talked about earlier, pretty consistent performance throughout the second half, we are actually opening up our backlog with a runout that is showing improvement year-to-year from where we were opening last year. So while our total backlog at $121 billion is up 2% overall, down 3% at constant currency, that backlog and the composition of that backlog gives us much more better confidence and will make sequential improvement in our revenue growth trends as we move throughout the year. And then Systems, coming off of a phenomenal fourth quarter of 28% growth, growth across all 3 platforms, we expect growth to continue, albeit probably not at that rate, but it will continue as we continue to leverage the value of our mainframe proposition and start scaling our Power and the continuation of performance in our storage area.
Operator
Our last question is coming from David Grossman from Stifel Financial.
David Grossman
Actually, I think you may have just answered it. But just to be clear, obviously, the services is pretty important to your '18 outlook. And while both segments continue to face headwinds, the growth dynamic underlining the tech services and cloud is probably more opaque. So can you just talk about -- or you had talked about customer losses in the first half of '17, and you just mentioned the backlog and that opening up as we migrate into the first half of next year. So with that said, other than typical execution risk, is there any reason to believe that the growth rate of that business should not reaccelerate as the year progresses and maybe even get through some kind of slope dynamic as we anniversary the tough compares in the back half of the year?
James Kavanaugh
Yes, thanks, David. I appreciate the question. So as I -- as you indicated -- let me give you a little bit more color around our Services and, in particular, about our Services backlog runout. If you take our GBS business, our GBS business enters the year with a backlog that should yield in fiscal year of about 2/3 of its revenue. Still has about 1/3 of the revenue that we need to go do sell and bill and translate that backlog into revenue yield throughout the year, but that 2/3 of that backlog shows a significant improvement versus where we were beginning 2017. And that shows sequential improvement as we move throughout the year.
Now the focus in GBS, we've already transformed our Consulting business. As Martin talked throughout the year, signings lead to backlog, lead to revenue growth. We've now gotten two quarters in a row of Consulting growth in revenue. And we finished the year, I'll remind you, growing GBS signings four quarters in a row. The area of focus that we need now is around our AMS business. And that is around an area where we're helping our clients migrate to the cloud and also how we need to capitalize on leveraging the incumbency value of AMS overall. So I definitely see GBS improving its trajectory as we move throughout the year. And if we execute on the pipelines we got in place, I definitely see that we can grow by the end of the year in our GBS business. In GTS, which has much longer durations, the GTS business, the opening backlog is somewhere around 75% to 80% or maybe a little bit higher as you enter the year. So again, similar, we still got about 20% of work to do in the year to go get that revenue yield, but that 80% backlog is actually in a much better shape than what it was at the beginning of 2017, as we spoke about all year long, with some ending -- contract conclusions.
So with that, let me wrap up the call in by saying again, we're very pleased with the work we have done over the last year to reposition our business. And I hope what you took away from today's call is that we're entering with a stronger revenue and margin profile. Now as always, there's more work to do, and I look forward to sharing our progress and continuing this dialogue as we move through 2018. Thank you all for joining the call.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. In the third quarter, we delivered $19.2 billion of revenue, operating pre-tax income of $3.6 billion, and operating earnings per share of $3.30. Our revenue trajectory improved, and revenue was roughly flat year-to-year. This includes a modest benefit from currency, and so we were down 1% at constant currency, which is two points better than last quarter’s growth rate.
Our gross and pre-tax margins again improved sequentially, and we again had good free cash flow performance. With this performance, we continue to expect at least $13.80 of operating EPS for 2017, and free cash flow consistent with last year.
From a geographic perspective, our trajectory improvement was broad-based, and from a segment perspective, we had significant improvement in Cognitive Solutions and in Systems. Cognitive Solutions grew year-to-year, led by security, IoT, and our analytics and cognitive offerings, as well as growth in our Transaction Processing Software. So broad-based improvement across Cognitive.
In Systems, we had strong growth driven by the third consecutive quarter of growth in storage, and a solid launch of our new z14 mainframe, which was available for the last two weeks of the quarter. And in services, the revenue performance in both Global Business Services and Technology Services and Cloud Platforms was very similar to the second at constant currency. We had good signings performance this quarter, which were up year-to-year in both segments, including strong double-digit growth in GTS signings.
Across our segments, our strategic imperatives revenue was up 11%, or 10% at constant currency, with strong double-digit growth in cloud and security. While there’s not much difference between our constant currency and reported revenue rates this quarter, I’ll continue to focus on constant currency growth rates throughout. The revenue performance in the quarter is pretty much all organic. Revenue from our strategic imperatives over the last 12 months was also up 10% to $34.9 billion, and now represents 45% of IBM.
We’re embedding cloud and cognitive capabilities across our business, and our strategic imperatives, as we’ve said, are a signpost of the progress we’re making in helping our enterprise clients to extract value from data, and become digital businesses. And so our strategic imperatives aren’t separate businesses, but a view of the revenue across our segments that provide our clients with analytics, cloud, security, mobile and social capabilities.
This quarter, our Cloud revenue was up 20%, and over the last 12 months has grown to a $15.8 billion revenue base, which represents 20% of IBM’s revenue. Our as-a-Service revenue was up 24% in the third, and we exited the quarter with a $9.4 billion annual run rate. We’re able to drive these results, because we’re focused on helping our enterprise clients transform their IT.
Keep in mind, the IBM Cloud is built for the enterprise. It is the only cloud that integrates public, private, multi-cloud and traditional data centers through a single architecture and is designed for cognitive workloads. So as our clients look to use AI to extract value from data, Watson on the IBM Cloud is the AI platform for business, differentiated by vertical domain depth and in how it protects our clients’ data and insights. Because for enterprises, data matters, and industry matters. And that’s why we’ve built industry-specific cloud-based Cognitive Solutions in areas like oncology and life sciences in Watson Health, and risk and compliance in Watson Financial Services. They address new opportunity areas outside of traditional IT.
Our analytics revenue includes these new vertical businesses, as well as established horizontal offerings, like DB2, that are being transformed, are high value, and play a critical role in our clients’ environments. In total, analytics revenue was up 5% this quarter to nearly $5 billion. So this business is large, and it’s growing.
In security, we’ve recently embedded cognitive into many of our offerings. This quarter, across our segments, security grew about 50%, driven by our security software solutions and strong demand for the pervasive encryption capabilities in our new z14. The mainframe is a great example of a core platform that we’ve continually modernized, and now with new capabilities like machine learning on z and pervasive encryption, it’s been reinvented again for the cognitive and cloud era, as well as an ideal platform for blockchain.
As we build and scale new businesses, partnerships and ecosystems play a critical role. And so in the third quarter, we continued to launch new blockchain partnerships and networks, including an initiative with a group of leading food retailers and suppliers including Walmart, Kroger, Dole, Nestle and Unilever to address food safety. And we’re partnering with UBS and several global banks to build a blockchain-based platform to support trade finance.
In the area of big data, in partnership with Hortonworks, we announced new capabilities that allow data scientists to do big data analytics using IBM products on the Hortonworks data platform. And in the third quarter, we formed a new partnership with MIT to create the MIT-Watson AI lab. We’ll mobilize the talent of more than 100 AI scientists, professors and students to advance AI hardware, software and algorithms, and increase AI’s impact on industries and enterprises.
So across our business, we’re embedding cloud and cognitive capabilities into our offerings, which is fueling the shift to strategic imperatives. In many cases, we’re building new businesses that address new markets, while in others we’re investing to reinvent existing businesses with these same technologies. This is what you see in our revenue and profit dynamics.
So now, let me move on to our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue was $19.2 billion, and when you look at our revenue performance by geography, we had sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance in all three major geographic regions, so as I said earlier, broad-based improvement.
EMEA revenue performance improved 3 points from last quarter, to down 1% in the third. We had year-to-year growth in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, mitigated by declines in the UK. We recently signed large services engagements to provide cloud and digital services to clients in the UK, Germany and Spain. I’ll touch on a couple of them later. Our Asia Pacific revenue growth improved nearly 4 points and was up 2% year-to-year, with good growth in Japan and China. The Americas year-to-year performance improved nearly a point, driven by the US.
Looking at our margin performance, our gross margin was down 40 basis points year-to-year, which is another significant sequential improvement. Last quarter, we talked about the margin dynamics for the second half, and we said we’d get some improvement from mix and from productivity, which we did. And we said the impact from investments would moderate. So our margin came in as we said.
Our operating expense was down 1% versus last year, with little impact from currency and acquisitions this quarter. Our expense dynamics reflect the continued efficiency we’re driving in our underlying spending base, while continuing to invest to build and reinvent our platforms and solutions. Included within the 1% reduction, we had about $220 million less IP income year-to-year, and absorbed an impact of about $100 million year-to-year in SG&A associated with some commercial disputes.
Our operating pre-tax profit was $3.6 billion and pre-tax margin was 18.8%, which is down just 20 basis points year-to-year, and up sequentially. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15%, consistent with last quarter, and we had no discrete tax items in the quarter.
On the bottom line, our operating EPS was $3.30, essentially flat year-to-year. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow, which is similar to last quarter and last year’s third quarter, and we continue to expect our free cash flow for the full-year to be relatively flat year-to-year. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow of nearly $11 billion was 96% of our GAAP net income, and supports both a high-level of investment and shareholder returns.
Now turning to our segments, Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 3%, and pre-tax income was up 5%, so better than balanced performance this quarter. Both Solutions Software and Transaction Processing Software grew 3% and we had growth in both our annuity content and our transactional businesses.
Within our annuity content, our SaaS offerings had double-digit growth in revenue and signings again this quarter. And we also had continued growth in our software services, which support our solutions offerings through industry and product expertise. We also had good software transactional performance, as clients commit to the platform for the long term.
Our Cognitive Solutions revenue growth is driven by organic performance, as we’ve wrapped on most of our acquisitions. And we continue to invest to combine organic and acquired content to build cloud-based cognitive offerings. Within Solutions Software, growth was led by offerings in security and analytics. Our analytics growth was broad-based, including Business Intelligence & Data Discovery, where we had triple-digit SaaS growth led by Cognos Analytics. We also had strong growth in data warehousing, where we’re continuing to reinvent these offerings.
For example, in September, we launched our new unified data system, which leverages our DB2 technology and is built on IBM Power. Also in analytics, we had strong growth again this quarter in Watson, our Enterprise AI platform. Conversation API usage again had strong double-digit growth quarter to quarter. Clients have embedded cognitive into their workflows and are seeing compelling returns.
For example, in January, the Royal Bank of Scotland launched Cora, leveraging both our conversation and discovery services. Cora now deflects nearly half of the calls from traditional channels while improving customer experience, significantly cutting down waiting times and freeing up time for call-center staff to deal with more complex problems, and we are benefitting from Cognitive ourselves.
IBM’s client support teams use Watson to help drastically reduce response time on more than 3.5 million service requests per year. Watson is trained on 7,000 IBM products and provides instant resolutions, based on what it has learned from previous similar requests. Watson has contributed to a 30% reduction in problem determination time across our Technical Support Services business.
We’re embedding cognitive into our Security offerings as well. Security software grew double digits this quarter, and this is clearly a hot market for us. We had strong growth across our security portfolio in areas such as endpoint protection, incident response and security intelligence, with offerings like Resilient and QRadar. Our clients using QRadar Advisor with Watson are seeing measurable results.
For example, clients found threats 60 times faster than manual investigations, and complex analysis went from an hour to less than a minute. As you would imagine, nothing matters more than time in these situations. Acceleration in the number of cybersecurity threats, the increasing requirements of regulatory compliance, including the upcoming GDPR, or General Data Protection Regulation, and our collaboration with Cisco and other partners on threat intelligence drove strong demand this quarter.
Looking at IoT, our revenue was up double digits this quarter. We introduced new offerings like IoT for Connected Products, as well as key enhancements around security and risk management. We signed nearly 40 new clients to the IoT Platform, including a shipping logistics provider, a global electronics components distributor, and a leading provider of wireless networking solutions. And the number of developers grew at a strong double-digit rate.
As we’ve said, an industry lens is key to our cognitive strategy, and this quarter, Watson Health continued to drive double-digit growth, with strength in Government, Oncology and Life Sciences similar to last quarter. We continued to expand the number of patients touched by Watson across our global ecosystem, as well as expand the number of countries. We also had strong growth in Watson Financial Services, as clients look to evolve their financial systems to make better-informed risk and compliance decisions, as well as modernize their core systems, like their payment gateways.
Turning to Transaction Processing Software, we had a strong quarter, with revenue up 3%, reflecting our clients’ ongoing long-term commitment and the value our platform provides to them. This portfolio predominately runs on-premise, mission critical workloads in industries like banking, airlines and retail running on z Systems. So for the Cognitive Solutions segment, we’re embedding cognitive, scaling platforms and building high-value vertical solutions. We grew revenue in the quarter, which drove total IBM software revenue growth, and we expanded the Cognitive Solutions pre-tax income margin.
Global Business Services delivered $4.1 billion of revenue this quarter. The year-to-year performance is similar to last quarter, as we continue to transform the business. We’re investing to shift our practices to where we see the opportunity, which is around digital, cognitive, cloud and automation. Over the last 2.5 years, we’ve added tens of thousands of resources to these areas. We grew double digits in our strategic imperatives, and overall GBS signings grew for the third consecutive quarter. With modest growth in signings, it takes time for our progress to be reflected in revenue and profit.
Consulting revenue grew 1%, led by our digital strategy and iX platform, which is up over 40%. The consulting backlog also returned to growth this quarter. IBM iX is helping clients digitally reinvent themselves. IBM iX was an early mover in the digital space, and we’ve built a global network where clients can co-create with us. We now have 36 studios around the world, which gives us unmatched reach. We recently announced the intention to acquire Vivant, a digital agency based in Australia. This adds to the acquisitions we did last year in Europe and North America to bring in new skills and rapidly expand our global iX capabilities.
We’re also leveraging strategic partnerships and investing in emerging technologies. In the third quarter we signed a five-year collaboration with Volkswagen to develop new mobility services that will utilize our cloud and cognitive capabilities to create highly personalized digital experiences for drivers. We also launched our blockchain services practice that will include more than 1,500 consultants who can help enterprises implement blockchain-enabled business models.
Application Management revenue declined 3%. We grew in the practices that help clients implement new cloud-centric architectures in their critical applications. We’re leveraging our incumbency to modernize their application suites by implementing cloud-based microservices and helping them build cloud-native applications into their environments. Overall performance was impacted by areas that are not as differentiated, where we are seeing pricing pressure and driving productivity for our clients.
Turning to profit, our Global Business Services gross profit margin decline was similar to last quarter. The GBS PTI margin of 10.8% is up 3 points sequentially, and the year-to-year performance improved by over a point. The GBS margin has been impacted by the investments we’re making to drive our transformation. We are acquiring to bring in important new skills and scale them across the organization.
We’re investing in the enablement of our practitioners, shifting resources to new areas, while also hiring top talent. The margin dynamics also reflect pricing and profit pressure in the more traditional IT services, such as back-office implementations of on-premise applications and parts of the Global Processing Services business. As we go forward, we are focused on improving our productivity with a streamlined practice model and new project management approaches.
So in summary for GBS, the revenue and profit trajectory was similar to last quarter. Consulting returned to growth while Application Management decelerated. We continue to grow in our practices around cloud, analytics, and mobility services, and we’re investing in our skills to continue to drive our GBS transformation.
Technology Services & Cloud Platforms generated $8.5 billion of revenue, with year-to-year performance similar to last quarter. We continue to grow revenue double digits in our strategic imperatives, led by cloud. The annual as-a-service run-rate for the segment is now $6.2 billion. With good momentum in our cloud offerings, we grew overall GTS signings by over 25%. Our total services backlog trajectory improved by 2 points compared to last quarter as we returned to backlog growth in Infrastructure Services. GTS continues to be the market share leader, and is nearly two-times the size of our largest competitor.
Looking at the lines of business, Infrastructure Services revenue was down 5%. This reflects the fact that we haven’t yet wrapped on the year-to-year headwinds that we talked about earlier this year, and we’re not yet yielding the full benefit from some of the new contracts we signed in the first half. In addition, we’re shifting away from some lower value work.
We had strong signings performance in Infrastructure Services this quarter, as clients look to implement hybrid cloud environments. They turn to the IBM Cloud, because it’s designed for data, AI, and security, and it’s the only cloud that integrates public, private, multi-cloud, and legacy data centers through a single architecture.
For example, at BBVA, the second largest bank in Spain, we signed an agreement to transform their current infrastructure. This will create the foundation for them to move ahead with their cloud strategy. We’ll work with BBVA to optimize their infrastructure, while enabling them to maintain control of their data and operations. Technical Support Services revenue was down 2%. We’re focused on driving our multi-vendor support offerings, which provide our clients with a single source of expertise and visibility across different vendor solutions.
For example, we are working with HSBC to support data center maintenance of banking locations across 60 countries. In the U.S., we are providing an integrated solution to Walgreens that includes retail analytics and IBM Cloud infrastructure to improve the efficiency of field service support at over 8,100 drug stores nationwide. And in South Korea, we’re deploying a multi-vendor support solution with Hana Financial Group to standardize the IT maintenance systems at three of Hana’s subsidiary groups.
Looking at the software content within the segment, Integration Software revenue was down 3%. And within that, we continue to have strong growth in SaaS across the portfolio, as we help our clients implement hybrid cloud environments. This was offset by declines in areas like on-premise DevOps and IT service management.
Turning to profit, gross profit margin for Technology Services & Cloud Platforms was down 1 point year-to-year, consistent with last quarter’s performance. The PTI margin of 13.8% is up 2 points sequentially, and the year-to-year performance is also about 2 points better than last quarter. We’re yielding savings from actions we’ve taken and we continue to focus on delivering productivity to our clients.
We’re investing to expand our cloud infrastructure, which is currently impacting our margin. With nearly 60 cloud centers across 19 countries, the IBM Cloud provides our clients with the flexibility to store data however and wherever they choose. We are also focused on scaling the IBM Services Platform with Watson that we announced in July. This is a delivery platform that is designed to identify and predict potential problems and self-heal. The platform will redefine service delivery and quality, providing significant competitive advantages to our clients.
So to summarize Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, the revenue and profit declines this quarter were similar to last quarter. We continue to see momentum in cloud, grew signings double digits and improved our services backlog year-to-year performance. We’re continuing to invest in our cloud infrastructure and we are transforming our services delivery platform with Watson.
In Systems, we had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. Performance was driven by a combination of strong z14 acceptance, and growth in Storage. Power declined, consistent with where we are in that product cycle. Our Systems margin was up year-to-year and sequentially, as mainframe and storage margins grew, while Power margin was flat.
IBM Z revenue grew 62% year-to-year on 33% MIPS growth, and margins expanded after a successful launch of the z14 program in mid-September. This success is due to the strong demand for technology that helps address the growing threat of global data breaches, and the need to operate within regulated environments. Our new z14 mainframe with its unprecedented encryption capabilities, encrypts all data associated with any application, cloud service or database all the time, without the possibility of human intervention. And that’s with no application change and no performance impact.
So, the appeal is obvious, and we had good traction across a broad mix of industries and geographies. And across the z platform, we are addressing emerging workloads in areas like blockchain, machine learning, and new payment systems. For example, when banks are trying to figure out how to manage new requirements within the EU’s payment modernization initiative, they come to us. Given the critical nature of the European financial services backbone, IBM Z provides the necessary reliability, scalability and security, and that’s why we had key wins in instant payments this quarter.
The Power revenue was down 8% year-to-year, driven by declines in UNIX, though UNIX high-end systems grew again. We continue to have good growth in Linux, and with double-digit growth in Linux workloads, Linux-on-Power now represents over 20% of our Power portfolio.
Later this quarter, we will deliver our next-gen POWER9 to market, starting with two U.S. Department of Energy supercomputing centers. This is strong evidence of the importance of Power to the high-performance computing market, and we will roll out commercial POWER9 solutions throughout 2018. So in an era of cognitive and AI, where data is fundamental to our enterprise clients, Power is demonstrably better for Linux machine learning and deep learning workloads, the workloads of the future. And that’s why we’re committed to the Power platform.
Storage hardware was up 4%, and as I said earlier, this is the third consecutive quarter of storage revenue growth. We had growth across our major hardware product areas, including in key midrange and high-end product lines, which grew double digits. Our all-flash array offerings once again grew strong double digits, in line with the high-growth market. And our Storage software, which is reported in Cognitive Solutions also had double-digit growth in Software Defined Storage, reflecting the shift in value to software.
So to summarize Systems, our year-to-year revenue grew double-digits and gross and pre-tax margins expanded, with strong performance in z Systems. This reflects our focus on continually reinventing this portfolio to address new workloads.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we had another good quarter. We generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. After nearly $800 million in capital investments, we delivered $2.5 billion of free cash flow, and that’s up modestly, reflecting strong working capital performance and lower workforce rebalancing payments, as well as higher cash taxes year-to-year. We’re continuing to convert our net income to free cash flow at a high rate, with our free cash flow realization at 96% over the last 12 months.
Through the first three quarters of the year, we’ve generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow, which is down just under $800 million. You’ll recall that in the first quarter, our free cash flow was down $1.2 billion year-to-year, driven entirely by the foreign cash tax refund we received last year. Now, with free cash flow growth in the second and third quarters, we’ve reduced the year-to-year decline.
As we generate profit consistent with our EPS guidance and with a tailwind in both our workforce rebalancing payments and cash taxes in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect our full-year free cash flow to be relatively flat year-to-year. In terms of uses of cash, over the last nine months, we’ve returned $7.8 billion to our shareholders, including $4.1 billion in dividends and $3.7 billion to buy back almost 23 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had 926 million shares outstanding, and a 1.5 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Looking at the balance sheet, we continue to have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long-term. We ended the quarter with $11.5 billion in cash and total debt was $45.6 billion. Both are higher than year-end, driven by the timing of our term debt issuances.
About two-thirds of our debt was in support of our financing business, and includes our first public debt issuance of $3 billion in the third quarter out of our newly reorganized financing entity. This business continues to be leveraged at a debt-to-equity ratio of 9 to 1. The credit quality of our financing receivables remained strong at 52% investment grade. That’s flat versus December and a point better than a year ago. And as always, we’ve included more information on our financing business in the supplemental charts in the back-up.
So now let me wrap up with a quick summary of the third quarter and some comments on considerations for the fourth. 90 days ago, I talked about planting the flag to mark the beginning of an improvement of the trajectory of our business, which would result in a second half that was improved over the first. Now in the third quarter, we’ve improved our year-to-year revenue and margin trajectory. This was led by strong performance in our Cognitive Solutions and Systems segments. And our strategic imperatives revenue across our segments grew at 10%, reflecting our success in embedding cognitive and cloud into more of what we offer.
As we look to fourth quarter, as always we’ve got a range of scenarios, especially when you consider the typical large transactional base in our fourth quarter. Last year, we increased revenue by $2.5 billion from third to fourth quarter. This year, we’d expect stronger sequential performance, due in part to the mainframe cycle, so perhaps $300 to $400 million more, and of course that quarter-to-quarter will depend on currency too.
Now looking at gross margin, we’ve had good progression over the last couple of quarters, driven by mix and some moderation in the headwinds from investments. In the fourth quarter, again we have a number of scenarios, but all are consistent with the sequential improvement we’ve seen over the last few years, so an increase of 2.5 to 3.5 points in gross margin from third to fourth quarter.
For expense, we’ve been driving efficiency in our spend base, and we’ll continue to do that. But keep in mind that with a weaker dollar, currency hedges will impact the expense line. And regarding IP income, we have a great list of opportunities and we expect to close some of them, but as always, we’re certainly not relying on all of them.
And then finally, let me comment on tax. As we’ve discussed in the past, our tax rate reflects our mix of business, both country and product mix. As we enter the fourth quarter with a seasonally large transaction base, we continue to see an ongoing operational tax rate of 15%, plus or minus 3 points as the right range. And as you know, that’s not changed since we provided EPS guidance back in January.
Remember, we widened the range in 2017 because of the tax reform discussions currently underway at a political level. In common with many companies, those tax reform discussions could still result in IBM taking planning actions this year. We also may have discrete tax items in the fourth quarter. At this point we don’t know if, or how much, and then how much will be absorbed by other actions.
However, as we sit here today entering the fourth quarter, our views on tax remain unchanged. So you put all of this together, and we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017, and as I mentioned earlier, free cash flow that is consistent with last year.
And with that, we’ll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So, operator, let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Ms. Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Katy Huberty
Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Martin, you made nice progress on gross margin in the quarter, but a lot of that did come in the back of the z14 product cycle. Do you see a path to year-on-year gross margin expansion at some point over the next year? And do you think that you can achieve that even as the mainframe contributions flows in a couple of quarters? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, thanks. Thanks, Katy. So a couple of things. One, while the mainframe improved a bit of the mix, it’s also software mix that helped in the quarter. So I wouldn’t attribute it all the mainframe. And as you know, and as we’ve been talking about, we’ve been focused on the productivity in our services business. So there are multiple contributors coming out of the third, which will also drive in the fourth some improvement.
So what we said in the – in our prepared remarks is, we have a range. At the low-end of the range, we’d say a very similar kind of a trajectory that we saw in the – year-to-year trajectory saw in the third. But at the high end of the range, we would show some more and improved trajectory, if you will, relative to the year-to-year.
Now as we go into next year, we’ll talk more about 2018. Obviously, in January, when we can see what kind of momentum we have in our software business, we can see what kind of signings momentum we have to drive our services platform. But our model, as you know, is to grow margins. We’re not talking about 100 or 150 basis points. Our model is to grow 30, 40, 50 basis points of margins. And I would say that, we are going to get there in the next year.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy. Can we please go to the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, Martin, nice to see some positive growth in Cognitive Solutions. Could you just help us understand what is enabling the growth over there? And you – as you think about December quarter and potentially beyond that, how sustainable do you think this growth is you go forward?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, thanks. Thanks, Amit. So a couple of things on the historical side. We saw good growth, pretty broad-based growth in the solution software categories. And that includes obviously our analytics business. It includes our security business, and we’ve got good double-digit growth across many industries, including health and FSS, and our Watson Health and FSS categories as well.
So pretty good broad-based improvement in solutions software. As you know, also within that segment is our transaction processing software business, which was also up in the quarter. So good execution in the quarter. As we go into fourth now, we’re not relying on growth coming out of that TPS part of that business. Now that business, it’s important for us to make sure we maintain high renewal rates in our S&S categories, for instance, which we have that drives then this kind of strong transactional performance, but we’re not relying on that to continue.
We do expect given that our solutions software business has attracted a lot of investment. I think that that team is positioned itself pretty well to continue to see growth going into the fourth.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Amit. Let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Go ahead, please.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes, thank you. You obviously had a very positive contribution from the mainframe on the system side. But I was wondering if you could maybe help us understand how the mainframe might be – might have helped financial results in the quarter more broadly? I think historically, at your Analyst Day, you said that 45% of mainframe revenue was actually strategic imperatives, and you commented about how transaction processing software was – a lot of it was mainframe-related.
So to that end, maybe you can tell us what strategic imperative growth would have been ex mainframe in the quarter? And also for Cognitive Solutions, how we would think about growth ex software that runs in the mainframe in the quarter? With the intention of really trying to understand given that mainframe cycles are pretty cyclical, how much of the growth that you’re seeing in strategic imperatives and cognitive was aided by mainframe in the quarter? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Tony, I’ll – I think I got it all and I’ll try to address some kind of piece by piece. So from a mainframe perspective and we’ve talked about this in the past, the hardware part of the cycle is quite profound. And we spent – we spend a lot of time explaining what we expect to see on the hardware side. The software side is not as tied to a cycle. The software side has obviously tied to the platform, but the cycle for software does not coincide or is tied in any way to the hardware cycle.
And then the other part of the business that I would say – two other parts of the business that I think are important, on the maintenance side, the maintenance business is impacted by the hardware cycle because of the warranty period that kicks in with new mainframes. Now the bulk of that hasn’t obviously happened yet, because we’re only two weeks in here at the end of the quarter.
So no tie real – no real tie on software. Maintenance gets impacted. The other benefit – the other business that benefits from the mainframe cycle is our Global Financing business. And most, I think all – nearly all mainframes are financed through Global Financing, certainly 90% or so attach rate in that business. So that will help the volumes, but given that the business itself probably had the volume before it maintains its position as opposed to grows the asset base dramatically.
So GF volumes will improve in the quarter. With regard to the strategic imperatives and we’ve talked a lot about how 12 months or trailing 12-month period is a right way to look at it, given that we in the cycle for the hardware side have been – our strategic imperatives growth has been held back, if you will, by the mainframe cycle, obviously was helped a bit – has helped a little bit in the third.
But on a trailing 12-month basis now, the mainframe really has become a neutral with regard to the strategic imperatives, really no impact to the growth rate on a trailing 12-month period. So ex mainframe trailing 12 months strategic imperatives are the exact same number. Now they’ll contribute a bit as they become – when we get to the biggest quarter in the fourth, but on a trailing 12-month basis no impact.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thanks, Tony. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.
David Grossman
Thank you. So, Martin, I know it’s been a while since you’ve had an FX tailwind and that there are several factors related to currency that can impact margins. However, are there any tools or historical reference points that you can provide that, A, help us better understand how currency tailwind may impact the margins over the next 12 months?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Sure, David. So well, first, I’d like to thank you for pointing out that we have had a pretty dramatic headwind. In fact, I think from the time I’ve been in this job now, this is my 15th call. I think I’ve only had one other call where it was a small tailwind. And this was a small tailwind as well in the quarter, and hopefully, we’ve wrapped on some of the big, more profound effect.
When we look at a dramatic impact like what happened in 2015 and the strengthening of the dollar from a cash perspective that cost us just on the translation, if you will, of translating all that cash back to U.S. dollars. It was like $2 billion impact. Now we hedge our cash flows, and so that helps defer the impact, if you will. But when you have a dramatic move like that, the impact is still more than $1 billion from a cash perspective.
Now the margin impact is a little bit different. And depending on the broad-based nature of a dollar move, it will be anywhere from a small positive to a small negative. But the real impact again is the absolutes in terms of what it’s doing to profit and what it’s doing to cash.
Patricia Murphy
Great. Thanks, David. Jay, can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. Martin, it’s good to see the improved revenue trajectory on a constant currency organic basis here. Can you address what is driving the 35% growth cloud within GBS specifically? And given that strategic revenues in GBS are greater than 60% of overall segment. Is it the pricing issues you noted earlier that is causing this gross margin rate still to be down year-on-year basis? And can you just confirm that the strategic imperatives gross margins are actually higher than segment average for GBS? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Wamsi, no problems, we’ll talk about each of those pieces. Maybe I’ll start from the most recent, not just because I remember that one the best, but because you just said it. But – so first, from a strategic imperative margin perspective, our margins in strategic imperatives, this is across IBM remain higher than the margins in outside, if you will, the strategic imperative revenue streams. And as we’ve always said, that’s a good indication that the future is obviously better than the past.
Now that has a couple of elements to it. In the case of the IBM – broad IBM businesses, some of that’s driven by mix, because we have a better software content in those strategic imperatives than we do in the core. In the case of GBS, it is actually that the pricing is – we’re better able to differentiate and capture the pricing, if you will, in those strategic imperative areas.
So when you think about the design studios we’ve built around the world and you think about how we bring skills to help our clients transform their digital interactions with their clients, that is – it’s important work clients value it highly. And when you have good skills and global capabilities, you can earn good returns. The GBS team, I think has positioned themselves pretty well for getting the benefit, if you will, of that shift and moving more and more into their strategic imperatives.
And our work says that the margins are in fact higher as they move into those new areas. There is still though we still have some labor focused on some of these older areas that are less differentiated. And as we noted in our prepared remarks, those see margin pressure, and this is a competitive industry. So it’s not only competitive where there is less differentiation, we’re not confused by the competition in even in the newer areas.
So we know we have to keep moving our teams and rescaling and making sure that we are at the forefront of those new areas. But those older areas are also very competitive and a lot of our competitors would look at those as kind of access points where they haven’t developed yet the most robust skills, they look at those as access points to get into our clients. So we’re still experiencing that phenomena.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Wamsi. Can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Your line is now open.
Steve Milunovich
Great. Thank you. Martin, I wanted to touch on your tax situation. I think you’ve got $4 billion plus of tax credits and NOLs remaining. So it feels like you could see number of discretes over time and perhaps see a tax rate consistently below 15% even if it’s not always predictable. How do you think about that? And how much cash impact is there with these tax credits and NOLs going forward?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Steve, so a few things. On the rate itself, we’re at, as we said, 15. And from a – from the way we’ve been thinking about it and talking about how it’s embedded in our guidance, we’re at 15 plus or minus three ex discrete, and that’s been consistent since we started the year now, we just came out of the third quarter when and quite frankly kind of a rare 90-day period when you do business in 162 countries, we had no discrete tax events, so somewhat rare. But it’s – it is what it is. We can either predict nor necessarily predict the magnitude or the timing of discrete events by their very nature.
Now we do take, as you know, which causes the $4 billion or so of deferred tax liabilities or assets. so we do take a pretty conservative view on how we book – how we run a book against our tax. And that’s what creates these discrete tax events, which by and large for us tend to be – tend to come back into the income statement as opposed to finding that something is going to fall out, because discreet, let’s face it, discretes can go either way. They can be helps or hurts.
For us, by and large, because we’re pretty conservative. They’re – they tend to be helps. We don’t know in terms of what’s going to happen in the fourth quarter, again, the 90-day period went through a somewhat rare and we don’t know if and we don’t know when and we don’t know how much they might be. But yes, we do our principle of how conservative we are has not changed. And therefore, I would expect that the discretes will be more credits than debits, but it was a, again a kind of a unique period.
So we’ll see where we go through the fourth from a rate perspective, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the three – the plus or minus 3 points is the right way to think about it, given the discussions going on around tax reform. And then obviously, we don’t know, we have assumptions about the mix of the business, but the assumptions change particularly when you’re in the big – you’re in the biggest part of the year, and then we’ll see what happens as the – as we go through the quarter on discretes.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thanks, Steve. Jay, can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Jim Suva
Thank you very much. Martin, the press and reviews of your new mainframe have been very positive and impressive. Is there the view that within IBM and externally that the demand for this product could be take us out of the slow and steady decline that mainframes have been doing? Is it that good of a product, or how should we kind of think about it as far as the mainframe cycle, which typically last kind of three to four years?
Martin Schroeter
Yes. So a couple of things, Jim. So first, this new mainframe and the mainframe’s always redesigned, rebuilt for the most contemporary workloads. This new mainframe addresses what is probably top of mind in every board discussion. It is top of mind for every CEO and it’s top of mind for the whole C-suite, which is the problem of cybersecurity. So it addresses it in a way that nobody else can address it and it’s been, as we said very well received by the marketplace.
Now, the mainframe was reinvented in the last instantiation to address mobile and cloud and analytics. And before that it was reinvented to address the performance and the capacity needs to help our clients optimize their own data center. So we’ve gone through we – as we always do, we go through a process by which we work with our clients to address how we can make sure that the mainframe retains their most important workloads and included in that discussion is bringing new workloads onto it, and we’ve done some of that, we had new clients.
So, the long-term outlook for the mainframe and the model for the mainframe is to be a very stable business, very high value and one that’s going to obviously be cyclical on the hardware side because of the cycle. But we actually see given how we’ve reinvented it this time that and the teams are working on this to try to figure out, yes, we’re not just talking about new workloads, which we obviously have within our existing clients, there are not too many businesses out there. In fact, you’d be hard pressed to find one that isn’t – that doesn’t have workloads that can be – can benefit from being rewritten and run on the mainframe, given the capabilities it has.
Now that is not a process that’s going to sort itself out in two weeks. Things that run in an x86 environment, things that run on other platforms have to be reworked. They have to come into the mainframe platform. We’ve got a terrific group of developers and lab services that help the teams do that not only for existing clients, but can do it for new clients as well. So given the problems this mainframe solves, I do think that there is an opportunity for us to further expand the market by further expanding the kind of workloads and the relevance that it plays in new environments.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Jim. Can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
James Schneider
Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Martin, it’s good to see that the services signings were up 25%, excuse me, at least the GTS signings up 25%. Can you maybe give us some sense about given the customer specific issues, whether you see growth – a return to growth in GTS for next year? And can you maybe comment on the kind of bookings trends you’re seeing in the GBS in particular?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks, James, so a couple of things. The team did in the – in GTS, they did a nice job in delivering pretty good signings growth. Now this is a big backlog of business and they’ve managed in the infrastructure services side to get that backlog back to be flat for the now coming out of the quarter. And they – when they look at their opportunity pool, they see a pretty good quarter in terms of signings. All of that’s going to determine whether or not we see how quickly they come back to growth in 2018 and we’ll talk more about that in January.
Within that, I think it’s important to note that the reason they’ve been successful not only in the most recent quarter, but over the long-term the reason that backlog is holding up so well and we would expect it to get back to growth with a strong signings execution is, because they are doing the most contemporary work for our clients. They are taking our clients and new clients into the kinds of cloud environments that they want.
So they’re being successful, because they are moving to the future not because they’re doing the same things that they’ve always been doing for clients. And I think the GTS team has done a nice job again in third quarter and executing some large deals, but their value proposition is as robust as it ever has been. On the GBS side, we did see growth again in the signings in the quarter. It was only 2%, which was a slowdown from where we’ve been. But three quarters of growth now and what that’s been able to do for the GBS team is get that consulting backlog back to growth in the quarter. And the team has been very focused on delivering high-value to our clients and rebuilding the skills in that consulting base in order to do that.
So the consulting backlog being up is certainly a good starting point, but the backlog in total is still down. And so as we’ve said in the past, consistent signings growth will get to backlog growth, which will get the revenue growth. And I still think they’re on that path, although we are going to have to accelerate from the low single-digit signings in order to make that go faster.
So they position themselves well in the fourth to have a lot of opportunities to try to close. We’ll see how the fourth quarter goes for GBS as well, and that too like GTS will determine how we enter 2018.
Patricia Murphy
Great. Thanks, Jim. Jay, can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Tien-tsin Huang
Thanks. Hi, Martin and Patricia. Just I’ll ask on the transactional software side. So pretty good performance there in the third quarter. Do you feel good about that carrying into the fourth quarter, given the demand environment, as you see it today? I think you said that you’re not counting on transactional revenue in the fourth quarter. Does that mean we could see upside potential if 3Q trends persist? Just want to clarify that.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Tien-tsin. So, what you heard was a fair reflection of what we’re counting on, which is, we’re not counting on continued strong growth in parts of that portfolio things like transaction processing software. But make no mistake, the team is working on driving transactional performance in parts of that business, which quite frankly, we have a pretty hot hand in. We have got a hot hand in security. We’ve got a hot hand in some of the IoT space.
So we will continue to see good growth in parts of the business. And then for software in total, our as-a-services business continues to grow quite well, and we would expect to continue to see the as-a-service performance continue to grow. As-a-service in total was up to $9.4 billion run rate when we exited, and that’s pretty good sequential improvement from where we were in the second and we’ll – we would expect that the fourth will also drive some growth.
But again, the – we’re not relying on the TPS part of the business necessarily to grow. But our customer engagement business, our security business, these are businesses that have drawn a lot of investment and they’ve got a hot hand and they’ll continue to perform.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tien-tsin. Jay, can we please take one last question?
Operator
Thank you. Our last question is coming from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.
Keith Bachman
Hi, thank you very much. Martin, I also want to revisit on GBS, if I could. And the results relative to the rest of the businesses are still demonstrating challenges both on top line and on the margin profile. And the context of the question is, as you mentioned, application management is still experiencing challenge and all participants in the industry seem to be echoing the same thing.
So if application management continues to experience challenges, what are the conditions that allows GBS to improve? and in particular, as you look at FY 2018, is it – well, how should we be thinking about expectations if we just isolate on the margin profile? If application management continues to experience those challenges, is it reasonable to assume that margins could flatten out? But any comments there on- broadly on the role of ADM within the context of GBS?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. I mean, for us, this business is all about helping our client – helping our clients move to the cloud. So where we’re helping clients implement cloud-centric architectures, we’re moving them to next-gen apps like Salesforce and Workday and we’ve built terrific skills. We’ve even acquired skills to help accelerate this. There is plenty of room for us to both differentiate to get growth and to have good margin performance.
So in those areas which are – we’re more able to differentiate, I think there is a good future there, and that’s what the team is focused on. And then in the other parts of the business, as I mentioned, the other parts of that business where it’s more difficult to differentiate and where others who haven’t built the kind of skill base that we have are trying to get inroads, then there’s some price pressure, but that’s not the future. The future for us is helping our clients move to those cloud-centric architectures and the cloud – the next-gen apps, which is what the team is positioned themselves well to continue to do not only in the fourth, but going into 2018.
Martin Schroeter
So let me wrap up the call and first, by saying thanks for joining us today. As we said at the start of the year and then we reiterated again in July, we said we see improved trajectories in the second half of the year relative to the first half then we talked about the drivers of that change. Our third quarter performance certainly reinforced that. And while we have more to get done in the fourth, it shows we’re on the right course. And it also shows quite frankly, that our confidence in our strategy is very well placed. So thanks again for joining us today and we’ll talk to you in January.
Patricia Murphy

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. In the third quarter, we delivered $19.2 billion of revenue, operating pre-tax income of $3.6 billion, and operating earnings per share of $3.30. Our revenue trajectory improved, and revenue was roughly flat year-to-year. This includes a modest benefit from currency, and so we were down 1% at constant currency, which is two points better than last quarter’s growth rate.
Our gross and pre-tax margins again improved sequentially, and we again had good free cash flow performance. With this performance, we continue to expect at least $13.80 of operating EPS for 2017, and free cash flow consistent with last year.
From a geographic perspective, our trajectory improvement was broad-based, and from a segment perspective, we had significant improvement in Cognitive Solutions and in Systems. Cognitive Solutions grew year-to-year, led by security, IoT, and our analytics and cognitive offerings, as well as growth in our Transaction Processing Software. So broad-based improvement across Cognitive.
In Systems, we had strong growth driven by the third consecutive quarter of growth in storage, and a solid launch of our new z14 mainframe, which was available for the last two weeks of the quarter. And in services, the revenue performance in both Global Business Services and Technology Services and Cloud Platforms was very similar to the second at constant currency. We had good signings performance this quarter, which were up year-to-year in both segments, including strong double-digit growth in GTS signings.
Across our segments, our strategic imperatives revenue was up 11%, or 10% at constant currency, with strong double-digit growth in cloud and security. While there’s not much difference between our constant currency and reported revenue rates this quarter, I’ll continue to focus on constant currency growth rates throughout. The revenue performance in the quarter is pretty much all organic. Revenue from our strategic imperatives over the last 12 months was also up 10% to $34.9 billion, and now represents 45% of IBM.
We’re embedding cloud and cognitive capabilities across our business, and our strategic imperatives, as we’ve said, are a signpost of the progress we’re making in helping our enterprise clients to extract value from data, and become digital businesses. And so our strategic imperatives aren’t separate businesses, but a view of the revenue across our segments that provide our clients with analytics, cloud, security, mobile and social capabilities.
This quarter, our Cloud revenue was up 20%, and over the last 12 months has grown to a $15.8 billion revenue base, which represents 20% of IBM’s revenue. Our as-a-Service revenue was up 24% in the third, and we exited the quarter with a $9.4 billion annual run rate. We’re able to drive these results, because we’re focused on helping our enterprise clients transform their IT.
Keep in mind, the IBM Cloud is built for the enterprise. It is the only cloud that integrates public, private, multi-cloud and traditional data centers through a single architecture and is designed for cognitive workloads. So as our clients look to use AI to extract value from data, Watson on the IBM Cloud is the AI platform for business, differentiated by vertical domain depth and in how it protects our clients’ data and insights. Because for enterprises, data matters, and industry matters. And that’s why we’ve built industry-specific cloud-based Cognitive Solutions in areas like oncology and life sciences in Watson Health, and risk and compliance in Watson Financial Services. They address new opportunity areas outside of traditional IT.
Our analytics revenue includes these new vertical businesses, as well as established horizontal offerings, like DB2, that are being transformed, are high value, and play a critical role in our clients’ environments. In total, analytics revenue was up 5% this quarter to nearly $5 billion. So this business is large, and it’s growing.
In security, we’ve recently embedded cognitive into many of our offerings. This quarter, across our segments, security grew about 50%, driven by our security software solutions and strong demand for the pervasive encryption capabilities in our new z14. The mainframe is a great example of a core platform that we’ve continually modernized, and now with new capabilities like machine learning on z and pervasive encryption, it’s been reinvented again for the cognitive and cloud era, as well as an ideal platform for blockchain.
As we build and scale new businesses, partnerships and ecosystems play a critical role. And so in the third quarter, we continued to launch new blockchain partnerships and networks, including an initiative with a group of leading food retailers and suppliers including Walmart, Kroger, Dole, Nestle and Unilever to address food safety. And we’re partnering with UBS and several global banks to build a blockchain-based platform to support trade finance.
In the area of big data, in partnership with Hortonworks, we announced new capabilities that allow data scientists to do big data analytics using IBM products on the Hortonworks data platform. And in the third quarter, we formed a new partnership with MIT to create the MIT-Watson AI lab. We’ll mobilize the talent of more than 100 AI scientists, professors and students to advance AI hardware, software and algorithms, and increase AI’s impact on industries and enterprises.
So across our business, we’re embedding cloud and cognitive capabilities into our offerings, which is fueling the shift to strategic imperatives. In many cases, we’re building new businesses that address new markets, while in others we’re investing to reinvent existing businesses with these same technologies. This is what you see in our revenue and profit dynamics.
So now, let me move on to our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue was $19.2 billion, and when you look at our revenue performance by geography, we had sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance in all three major geographic regions, so as I said earlier, broad-based improvement.
EMEA revenue performance improved 3 points from last quarter, to down 1% in the third. We had year-to-year growth in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, mitigated by declines in the UK. We recently signed large services engagements to provide cloud and digital services to clients in the UK, Germany and Spain. I’ll touch on a couple of them later. Our Asia Pacific revenue growth improved nearly 4 points and was up 2% year-to-year, with good growth in Japan and China. The Americas year-to-year performance improved nearly a point, driven by the US.
Looking at our margin performance, our gross margin was down 40 basis points year-to-year, which is another significant sequential improvement. Last quarter, we talked about the margin dynamics for the second half, and we said we’d get some improvement from mix and from productivity, which we did. And we said the impact from investments would moderate. So our margin came in as we said.
Our operating expense was down 1% versus last year, with little impact from currency and acquisitions this quarter. Our expense dynamics reflect the continued efficiency we’re driving in our underlying spending base, while continuing to invest to build and reinvent our platforms and solutions. Included within the 1% reduction, we had about $220 million less IP income year-to-year, and absorbed an impact of about $100 million year-to-year in SG&A associated with some commercial disputes.
Our operating pre-tax profit was $3.6 billion and pre-tax margin was 18.8%, which is down just 20 basis points year-to-year, and up sequentially. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15%, consistent with last quarter, and we had no discrete tax items in the quarter.
On the bottom line, our operating EPS was $3.30, essentially flat year-to-year. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow, which is similar to last quarter and last year’s third quarter, and we continue to expect our free cash flow for the full-year to be relatively flat year-to-year. Over the last 12 months, our free cash flow of nearly $11 billion was 96% of our GAAP net income, and supports both a high-level of investment and shareholder returns.
Now turning to our segments, Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 3%, and pre-tax income was up 5%, so better than balanced performance this quarter. Both Solutions Software and Transaction Processing Software grew 3% and we had growth in both our annuity content and our transactional businesses.
Within our annuity content, our SaaS offerings had double-digit growth in revenue and signings again this quarter. And we also had continued growth in our software services, which support our solutions offerings through industry and product expertise. We also had good software transactional performance, as clients commit to the platform for the long term.
Our Cognitive Solutions revenue growth is driven by organic performance, as we’ve wrapped on most of our acquisitions. And we continue to invest to combine organic and acquired content to build cloud-based cognitive offerings. Within Solutions Software, growth was led by offerings in security and analytics. Our analytics growth was broad-based, including Business Intelligence & Data Discovery, where we had triple-digit SaaS growth led by Cognos Analytics. We also had strong growth in data warehousing, where we’re continuing to reinvent these offerings.
For example, in September, we launched our new unified data system, which leverages our DB2 technology and is built on IBM Power. Also in analytics, we had strong growth again this quarter in Watson, our Enterprise AI platform. Conversation API usage again had strong double-digit growth quarter to quarter. Clients have embedded cognitive into their workflows and are seeing compelling returns.
For example, in January, the Royal Bank of Scotland launched Cora, leveraging both our conversation and discovery services. Cora now deflects nearly half of the calls from traditional channels while improving customer experience, significantly cutting down waiting times and freeing up time for call-center staff to deal with more complex problems, and we are benefitting from Cognitive ourselves.
IBM’s client support teams use Watson to help drastically reduce response time on more than 3.5 million service requests per year. Watson is trained on 7,000 IBM products and provides instant resolutions, based on what it has learned from previous similar requests. Watson has contributed to a 30% reduction in problem determination time across our Technical Support Services business.
We’re embedding cognitive into our Security offerings as well. Security software grew double digits this quarter, and this is clearly a hot market for us. We had strong growth across our security portfolio in areas such as endpoint protection, incident response and security intelligence, with offerings like Resilient and QRadar. Our clients using QRadar Advisor with Watson are seeing measurable results.
For example, clients found threats 60 times faster than manual investigations, and complex analysis went from an hour to less than a minute. As you would imagine, nothing matters more than time in these situations. Acceleration in the number of cybersecurity threats, the increasing requirements of regulatory compliance, including the upcoming GDPR, or General Data Protection Regulation, and our collaboration with Cisco and other partners on threat intelligence drove strong demand this quarter.
Looking at IoT, our revenue was up double digits this quarter. We introduced new offerings like IoT for Connected Products, as well as key enhancements around security and risk management. We signed nearly 40 new clients to the IoT Platform, including a shipping logistics provider, a global electronics components distributor, and a leading provider of wireless networking solutions. And the number of developers grew at a strong double-digit rate.
As we’ve said, an industry lens is key to our cognitive strategy, and this quarter, Watson Health continued to drive double-digit growth, with strength in Government, Oncology and Life Sciences similar to last quarter. We continued to expand the number of patients touched by Watson across our global ecosystem, as well as expand the number of countries. We also had strong growth in Watson Financial Services, as clients look to evolve their financial systems to make better-informed risk and compliance decisions, as well as modernize their core systems, like their payment gateways.
Turning to Transaction Processing Software, we had a strong quarter, with revenue up 3%, reflecting our clients’ ongoing long-term commitment and the value our platform provides to them. This portfolio predominately runs on-premise, mission critical workloads in industries like banking, airlines and retail running on z Systems. So for the Cognitive Solutions segment, we’re embedding cognitive, scaling platforms and building high-value vertical solutions. We grew revenue in the quarter, which drove total IBM software revenue growth, and we expanded the Cognitive Solutions pre-tax income margin.
Global Business Services delivered $4.1 billion of revenue this quarter. The year-to-year performance is similar to last quarter, as we continue to transform the business. We’re investing to shift our practices to where we see the opportunity, which is around digital, cognitive, cloud and automation. Over the last 2.5 years, we’ve added tens of thousands of resources to these areas. We grew double digits in our strategic imperatives, and overall GBS signings grew for the third consecutive quarter. With modest growth in signings, it takes time for our progress to be reflected in revenue and profit.
Consulting revenue grew 1%, led by our digital strategy and iX platform, which is up over 40%. The consulting backlog also returned to growth this quarter. IBM iX is helping clients digitally reinvent themselves. IBM iX was an early mover in the digital space, and we’ve built a global network where clients can co-create with us. We now have 36 studios around the world, which gives us unmatched reach. We recently announced the intention to acquire Vivant, a digital agency based in Australia. This adds to the acquisitions we did last year in Europe and North America to bring in new skills and rapidly expand our global iX capabilities.
We’re also leveraging strategic partnerships and investing in emerging technologies. In the third quarter we signed a five-year collaboration with Volkswagen to develop new mobility services that will utilize our cloud and cognitive capabilities to create highly personalized digital experiences for drivers. We also launched our blockchain services practice that will include more than 1,500 consultants who can help enterprises implement blockchain-enabled business models.
Application Management revenue declined 3%. We grew in the practices that help clients implement new cloud-centric architectures in their critical applications. We’re leveraging our incumbency to modernize their application suites by implementing cloud-based microservices and helping them build cloud-native applications into their environments. Overall performance was impacted by areas that are not as differentiated, where we are seeing pricing pressure and driving productivity for our clients.
Turning to profit, our Global Business Services gross profit margin decline was similar to last quarter. The GBS PTI margin of 10.8% is up 3 points sequentially, and the year-to-year performance improved by over a point. The GBS margin has been impacted by the investments we’re making to drive our transformation. We are acquiring to bring in important new skills and scale them across the organization.
We’re investing in the enablement of our practitioners, shifting resources to new areas, while also hiring top talent. The margin dynamics also reflect pricing and profit pressure in the more traditional IT services, such as back-office implementations of on-premise applications and parts of the Global Processing Services business. As we go forward, we are focused on improving our productivity with a streamlined practice model and new project management approaches.
So in summary for GBS, the revenue and profit trajectory was similar to last quarter. Consulting returned to growth while Application Management decelerated. We continue to grow in our practices around cloud, analytics, and mobility services, and we’re investing in our skills to continue to drive our GBS transformation.
Technology Services & Cloud Platforms generated $8.5 billion of revenue, with year-to-year performance similar to last quarter. We continue to grow revenue double digits in our strategic imperatives, led by cloud. The annual as-a-service run-rate for the segment is now $6.2 billion. With good momentum in our cloud offerings, we grew overall GTS signings by over 25%. Our total services backlog trajectory improved by 2 points compared to last quarter as we returned to backlog growth in Infrastructure Services. GTS continues to be the market share leader, and is nearly two-times the size of our largest competitor.
Looking at the lines of business, Infrastructure Services revenue was down 5%. This reflects the fact that we haven’t yet wrapped on the year-to-year headwinds that we talked about earlier this year, and we’re not yet yielding the full benefit from some of the new contracts we signed in the first half. In addition, we’re shifting away from some lower value work.
We had strong signings performance in Infrastructure Services this quarter, as clients look to implement hybrid cloud environments. They turn to the IBM Cloud, because it’s designed for data, AI, and security, and it’s the only cloud that integrates public, private, multi-cloud, and legacy data centers through a single architecture.
For example, at BBVA, the second largest bank in Spain, we signed an agreement to transform their current infrastructure. This will create the foundation for them to move ahead with their cloud strategy. We’ll work with BBVA to optimize their infrastructure, while enabling them to maintain control of their data and operations. Technical Support Services revenue was down 2%. We’re focused on driving our multi-vendor support offerings, which provide our clients with a single source of expertise and visibility across different vendor solutions.
For example, we are working with HSBC to support data center maintenance of banking locations across 60 countries. In the U.S., we are providing an integrated solution to Walgreens that includes retail analytics and IBM Cloud infrastructure to improve the efficiency of field service support at over 8,100 drug stores nationwide. And in South Korea, we’re deploying a multi-vendor support solution with Hana Financial Group to standardize the IT maintenance systems at three of Hana’s subsidiary groups.
Looking at the software content within the segment, Integration Software revenue was down 3%. And within that, we continue to have strong growth in SaaS across the portfolio, as we help our clients implement hybrid cloud environments. This was offset by declines in areas like on-premise DevOps and IT service management.
Turning to profit, gross profit margin for Technology Services & Cloud Platforms was down 1 point year-to-year, consistent with last quarter’s performance. The PTI margin of 13.8% is up 2 points sequentially, and the year-to-year performance is also about 2 points better than last quarter. We’re yielding savings from actions we’ve taken and we continue to focus on delivering productivity to our clients.
We’re investing to expand our cloud infrastructure, which is currently impacting our margin. With nearly 60 cloud centers across 19 countries, the IBM Cloud provides our clients with the flexibility to store data however and wherever they choose. We are also focused on scaling the IBM Services Platform with Watson that we announced in July. This is a delivery platform that is designed to identify and predict potential problems and self-heal. The platform will redefine service delivery and quality, providing significant competitive advantages to our clients.
So to summarize Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, the revenue and profit declines this quarter were similar to last quarter. We continue to see momentum in cloud, grew signings double digits and improved our services backlog year-to-year performance. We’re continuing to invest in our cloud infrastructure and we are transforming our services delivery platform with Watson.
In Systems, we had a strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. Performance was driven by a combination of strong z14 acceptance, and growth in Storage. Power declined, consistent with where we are in that product cycle. Our Systems margin was up year-to-year and sequentially, as mainframe and storage margins grew, while Power margin was flat.
IBM Z revenue grew 62% year-to-year on 33% MIPS growth, and margins expanded after a successful launch of the z14 program in mid-September. This success is due to the strong demand for technology that helps address the growing threat of global data breaches, and the need to operate within regulated environments. Our new z14 mainframe with its unprecedented encryption capabilities, encrypts all data associated with any application, cloud service or database all the time, without the possibility of human intervention. And that’s with no application change and no performance impact.
So, the appeal is obvious, and we had good traction across a broad mix of industries and geographies. And across the z platform, we are addressing emerging workloads in areas like blockchain, machine learning, and new payment systems. For example, when banks are trying to figure out how to manage new requirements within the EU’s payment modernization initiative, they come to us. Given the critical nature of the European financial services backbone, IBM Z provides the necessary reliability, scalability and security, and that’s why we had key wins in instant payments this quarter.
The Power revenue was down 8% year-to-year, driven by declines in UNIX, though UNIX high-end systems grew again. We continue to have good growth in Linux, and with double-digit growth in Linux workloads, Linux-on-Power now represents over 20% of our Power portfolio.
Later this quarter, we will deliver our next-gen POWER9 to market, starting with two U.S. Department of Energy supercomputing centers. This is strong evidence of the importance of Power to the high-performance computing market, and we will roll out commercial POWER9 solutions throughout 2018. So in an era of cognitive and AI, where data is fundamental to our enterprise clients, Power is demonstrably better for Linux machine learning and deep learning workloads, the workloads of the future. And that’s why we’re committed to the Power platform.
Storage hardware was up 4%, and as I said earlier, this is the third consecutive quarter of storage revenue growth. We had growth across our major hardware product areas, including in key midrange and high-end product lines, which grew double digits. Our all-flash array offerings once again grew strong double digits, in line with the high-growth market. And our Storage software, which is reported in Cognitive Solutions also had double-digit growth in Software Defined Storage, reflecting the shift in value to software.
So to summarize Systems, our year-to-year revenue grew double-digits and gross and pre-tax margins expanded, with strong performance in z Systems. This reflects our focus on continually reinventing this portfolio to address new workloads.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we had another good quarter. We generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. After nearly $800 million in capital investments, we delivered $2.5 billion of free cash flow, and that’s up modestly, reflecting strong working capital performance and lower workforce rebalancing payments, as well as higher cash taxes year-to-year. We’re continuing to convert our net income to free cash flow at a high rate, with our free cash flow realization at 96% over the last 12 months.
Through the first three quarters of the year, we’ve generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow, which is down just under $800 million. You’ll recall that in the first quarter, our free cash flow was down $1.2 billion year-to-year, driven entirely by the foreign cash tax refund we received last year. Now, with free cash flow growth in the second and third quarters, we’ve reduced the year-to-year decline.
As we generate profit consistent with our EPS guidance and with a tailwind in both our workforce rebalancing payments and cash taxes in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect our full-year free cash flow to be relatively flat year-to-year. In terms of uses of cash, over the last nine months, we’ve returned $7.8 billion to our shareholders, including $4.1 billion in dividends and $3.7 billion to buy back almost 23 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had 926 million shares outstanding, and a 1.5 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Looking at the balance sheet, we continue to have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long-term. We ended the quarter with $11.5 billion in cash and total debt was $45.6 billion. Both are higher than year-end, driven by the timing of our term debt issuances.
About two-thirds of our debt was in support of our financing business, and includes our first public debt issuance of $3 billion in the third quarter out of our newly reorganized financing entity. This business continues to be leveraged at a debt-to-equity ratio of 9 to 1. The credit quality of our financing receivables remained strong at 52% investment grade. That’s flat versus December and a point better than a year ago. And as always, we’ve included more information on our financing business in the supplemental charts in the back-up.
So now let me wrap up with a quick summary of the third quarter and some comments on considerations for the fourth. 90 days ago, I talked about planting the flag to mark the beginning of an improvement of the trajectory of our business, which would result in a second half that was improved over the first. Now in the third quarter, we’ve improved our year-to-year revenue and margin trajectory. This was led by strong performance in our Cognitive Solutions and Systems segments. And our strategic imperatives revenue across our segments grew at 10%, reflecting our success in embedding cognitive and cloud into more of what we offer.
As we look to fourth quarter, as always we’ve got a range of scenarios, especially when you consider the typical large transactional base in our fourth quarter. Last year, we increased revenue by $2.5 billion from third to fourth quarter. This year, we’d expect stronger sequential performance, due in part to the mainframe cycle, so perhaps $300 to $400 million more, and of course that quarter-to-quarter will depend on currency too.
Now looking at gross margin, we’ve had good progression over the last couple of quarters, driven by mix and some moderation in the headwinds from investments. In the fourth quarter, again we have a number of scenarios, but all are consistent with the sequential improvement we’ve seen over the last few years, so an increase of 2.5 to 3.5 points in gross margin from third to fourth quarter.
For expense, we’ve been driving efficiency in our spend base, and we’ll continue to do that. But keep in mind that with a weaker dollar, currency hedges will impact the expense line. And regarding IP income, we have a great list of opportunities and we expect to close some of them, but as always, we’re certainly not relying on all of them.
And then finally, let me comment on tax. As we’ve discussed in the past, our tax rate reflects our mix of business, both country and product mix. As we enter the fourth quarter with a seasonally large transaction base, we continue to see an ongoing operational tax rate of 15%, plus or minus 3 points as the right range. And as you know, that’s not changed since we provided EPS guidance back in January.
Remember, we widened the range in 2017 because of the tax reform discussions currently underway at a political level. In common with many companies, those tax reform discussions could still result in IBM taking planning actions this year. We also may have discrete tax items in the fourth quarter. At this point we don’t know if, or how much, and then how much will be absorbed by other actions.
However, as we sit here today entering the fourth quarter, our views on tax remain unchanged. So you put all of this together, and we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017, and as I mentioned earlier, free cash flow that is consistent with last year.
And with that, we’ll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So, operator, let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Ms. Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Q - Katy Huberty
Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Martin, you made nice progress on gross margin in the quarter, but a lot of that did come in the back of the z14 product cycle. Do you see a path to year-on-year gross margin expansion at some point over the next year? And do you think that you can achieve that even as the mainframe contributions flows in a couple of quarters? Thank you.
A - Martin Schroeter
Sure, thanks. Thanks, Katy. So a couple of things. One, while the mainframe improved a bit of the mix, it’s also software mix that helped in the quarter. So I wouldn’t attribute it all the mainframe. And as you know, and as we’ve been talking about, we’ve been focused on the productivity in our services business. So there are multiple contributors coming out of the third, which will also drive in the fourth some improvement.
So what we said in the – in our prepared remarks is, we have a range. At the low-end of the range, we’d say a very similar kind of a trajectory that we saw in the – year-to-year trajectory saw in the third. But at the high end of the range, we would show some more and improved trajectory, if you will, relative to the year-to-year.
Now as we go into next year, we’ll talk more about 2018. Obviously, in January, when we can see what kind of momentum we have in our software business, we can see what kind of signings momentum we have to drive our services platform. But our model, as you know, is to grow margins. We’re not talking about 100 or 150 basis points. Our model is to grow 30, 40, 50 basis points of margins. And I would say that, we are going to get there in the next year.
A - Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy. Can we please go to the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Q - Amit Daryanani
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, Martin, nice to see some positive growth in Cognitive Solutions. Could you just help us understand what is enabling the growth over there? And you – as you think about December quarter and potentially beyond that, how sustainable do you think this growth is you go forward?
A - Martin Schroeter
Sure, thanks. Thanks, Amit. So a couple of things on the historical side. We saw good growth, pretty broad-based growth in the solution software categories. And that includes obviously our analytics business. It includes our security business, and we’ve got good double-digit growth across many industries, including health and FSS, and our Watson Health and FSS categories as well.
So pretty good broad-based improvement in solutions software. As you know, also within that segment is our transaction processing software business, which was also up in the quarter. So good execution in the quarter. As we go into fourth now, we’re not relying on growth coming out of that TPS part of that business. Now that business, it’s important for us to make sure we maintain high renewal rates in our S&S categories, for instance, which we have that drives then this kind of strong transactional performance, but we’re not relying on that to continue.
We do expect given that our solutions software business has attracted a lot of investment. I think that that team is positioned itself pretty well to continue to see growth going into the fourth.
A - Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Amit. Let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Go ahead, please.
Q - Toni Sacconaghi
Yes, thank you. You obviously had a very positive contribution from the mainframe on the system side. But I was wondering if you could maybe help us understand how the mainframe might be – might have helped financial results in the quarter more broadly? I think historically, at your Analyst Day, you said that 45% of mainframe revenue was actually strategic imperatives, and you commented about how transaction processing software was – a lot of it was mainframe-related.
So to that end, maybe you can tell us what strategic imperative growth would have been ex mainframe in the quarter? And also for Cognitive Solutions, how we would think about growth ex software that runs in the mainframe in the quarter? With the intention of really trying to understand given that mainframe cycles are pretty cyclical, how much of the growth that you’re seeing in strategic imperatives and cognitive was aided by mainframe in the quarter? Thank you.
A - Martin Schroeter
Sure. Tony, I’ll – I think I got it all and I’ll try to address some kind of piece by piece. So from a mainframe perspective and we’ve talked about this in the past, the hardware part of the cycle is quite profound. And we spent – we spend a lot of time explaining what we expect to see on the hardware side. The software side is not as tied to a cycle. The software side has obviously tied to the platform, but the cycle for software does not coincide or is tied in any way to the hardware cycle.
And then the other part of the business that I would say – two other parts of the business that I think are important, on the maintenance side, the maintenance business is impacted by the hardware cycle because of the warranty period that kicks in with new mainframes. Now the bulk of that hasn’t obviously happened yet, because we’re only two weeks in here at the end of the quarter.
So no tie real – no real tie on software. Maintenance gets impacted. The other benefit – the other business that benefits from the mainframe cycle is our Global Financing business. And most, I think all – nearly all mainframes are financed through Global Financing, certainly 90% or so attach rate in that business. So that will help the volumes, but given that the business itself probably had the volume before it maintains its position as opposed to grows the asset base dramatically.
So GF volumes will improve in the quarter. With regard to the strategic imperatives and we’ve talked a lot about how 12 months or trailing 12-month period is a right way to look at it, given that we in the cycle for the hardware side have been – our strategic imperatives growth has been held back, if you will, by the mainframe cycle, obviously was helped a bit – has helped a little bit in the third.
But on a trailing 12-month basis now, the mainframe really has become a neutral with regard to the strategic imperatives, really no impact to the growth rate on a trailing 12-month period. So ex mainframe trailing 12 months strategic imperatives are the exact same number. Now they’ll contribute a bit as they become – when we get to the biggest quarter in the fourth, but on a trailing 12-month basis no impact.
A - Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thanks, Tony. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is now open.
Q - David Grossman
Thank you. So, Martin, I know it’s been a while since you’ve had an FX tailwind and that there are several factors related to currency that can impact margins. However, are there any tools or historical reference points that you can provide that, A, help us better understand how currency tailwind may impact the margins over the next 12 months?
A - Martin Schroeter
Sure. Sure, David. So well, first, I’d like to thank you for pointing out that we have had a pretty dramatic headwind. In fact, I think from the time I’ve been in this job now, this is my 15th call. I think I’ve only had one other call where it was a small tailwind. And this was a small tailwind as well in the quarter, and hopefully, we’ve wrapped on some of the big, more profound effect.
When we look at a dramatic impact like what happened in 2015 and the strengthening of the dollar from a cash perspective that cost us just on the translation, if you will, of translating all that cash back to U.S. dollars. It was like $2 billion impact. Now we hedge our cash flows, and so that helps defer the impact, if you will. But when you have a dramatic move like that, the impact is still more than $1 billion from a cash perspective.
Now the margin impact is a little bit different. And depending on the broad-based nature of a dollar move, it will be anywhere from a small positive to a small negative. But the real impact again is the absolutes in terms of what it’s doing to profit and what it’s doing to cash.
A - Patricia Murphy
Great. Thanks, David. Jay, can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Q - Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. Martin, it’s good to see the improved revenue trajectory on a constant currency organic basis here. Can you address what is driving the 35% growth cloud within GBS specifically? And given that strategic revenues in GBS are greater than 60% of overall segment. Is it the pricing issues you noted earlier that is causing this gross margin rate still to be down year-on-year basis? And can you just confirm that the strategic imperatives gross margins are actually higher than segment average for GBS? Thank you.
A - Martin Schroeter
Sure, Wamsi, no problems, we’ll talk about each of those pieces. Maybe I’ll start from the most recent, not just because I remember that one the best, but because you just said it. But – so first, from a strategic imperative margin perspective, our margins in strategic imperatives, this is across IBM remain higher than the margins in outside, if you will, the strategic imperative revenue streams. And as we’ve always said, that’s a good indication that the future is obviously better than the past.
Now that has a couple of elements to it. In the case of the IBM – broad IBM businesses, some of that’s driven by mix, because we have a better software content in those strategic imperatives than we do in the core. In the case of GBS, it is actually that the pricing is – we’re better able to differentiate and capture the pricing, if you will, in those strategic imperative areas.
So when you think about the design studios we’ve built around the world and you think about how we bring skills to help our clients transform their digital interactions with their clients, that is – it’s important work clients value it highly. And when you have good skills and global capabilities, you can earn good returns. The GBS team, I think has positioned themselves pretty well for getting the benefit, if you will, of that shift and moving more and more into their strategic imperatives.
And our work says that the margins are in fact higher as they move into those new areas. There is still though we still have some labor focused on some of these older areas that are less differentiated. And as we noted in our prepared remarks, those see margin pressure, and this is a competitive industry. So it’s not only competitive where there is less differentiation, we’re not confused by the competition in even in the newer areas.
So we know we have to keep moving our teams and rescaling and making sure that we are at the forefront of those new areas. But those older areas are also very competitive and a lot of our competitors would look at those as kind of access points where they haven’t developed yet the most robust skills, they look at those as access points to get into our clients. So we’re still experiencing that phenomena.
A - Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Wamsi. Can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Your line is now open.
Q - Steve Milunovich
Great. Thank you. Martin, I wanted to touch on your tax situation. I think you’ve got $4 billion plus of tax credits and NOLs remaining. So it feels like you could see number of discretes over time and perhaps see a tax rate consistently below 15% even if it’s not always predictable. How do you think about that? And how much cash impact is there with these tax credits and NOLs going forward?
A - Martin Schroeter
Sure, Steve, so a few things. On the rate itself, we’re at, as we said, 15. And from a – from the way we’ve been thinking about it and talking about how it’s embedded in our guidance, we’re at 15 plus or minus three ex discrete, and that’s been consistent since we started the year now, we just came out of the third quarter when and quite frankly kind of a rare 90-day period when you do business in 162 countries, we had no discrete tax events, so somewhat rare. But it’s – it is what it is. We can either predict nor necessarily predict the magnitude or the timing of discrete events by their very nature.
Now we do take, as you know, which causes the $4 billion or so of deferred tax liabilities or assets. so we do take a pretty conservative view on how we book – how we run a book against our tax. And that’s what creates these discrete tax events, which by and large for us tend to be – tend to come back into the income statement as opposed to finding that something is going to fall out, because discreet, let’s face it, discretes can go either way. They can be helps or hurts.
For us, by and large, because we’re pretty conservative. They’re – they tend to be helps. We don’t know in terms of what’s going to happen in the fourth quarter, again, the 90-day period went through a somewhat rare and we don’t know if and we don’t know when and we don’t know how much they might be. But yes, we do our principle of how conservative we are has not changed. And therefore, I would expect that the discretes will be more credits than debits, but it was a, again a kind of a unique period.
So we’ll see where we go through the fourth from a rate perspective, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the three – the plus or minus 3 points is the right way to think about it, given the discussions going on around tax reform. And then obviously, we don’t know, we have assumptions about the mix of the business, but the assumptions change particularly when you’re in the big – you’re in the biggest part of the year, and then we’ll see what happens as the – as we go through the quarter on discretes.
A - Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thanks, Steve. Jay, can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mr. Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Q - Jim Suva
Thank you very much. Martin, the press and reviews of your new mainframe have been very positive and impressive. Is there the view that within IBM and externally that the demand for this product could be take us out of the slow and steady decline that mainframes have been doing? Is it that good of a product, or how should we kind of think about it as far as the mainframe cycle, which typically last kind of three to four years?
A - Martin Schroeter
Yes. So a couple of things, Jim. So first, this new mainframe and the mainframe’s always redesigned, rebuilt for the most contemporary workloads. This new mainframe addresses what is probably top of mind in every board discussion. It is top of mind for every CEO and it’s top of mind for the whole C-suite, which is the problem of cybersecurity. So it addresses it in a way that nobody else can address it and it’s been, as we said very well received by the marketplace.
Now, the mainframe was reinvented in the last instantiation to address mobile and cloud and analytics. And before that it was reinvented to address the performance and the capacity needs to help our clients optimize their own data center. So we’ve gone through we – as we always do, we go through a process by which we work with our clients to address how we can make sure that the mainframe retains their most important workloads and included in that discussion is bringing new workloads onto it, and we’ve done some of that, we had new clients.
So, the long-term outlook for the mainframe and the model for the mainframe is to be a very stable business, very high value and one that’s going to obviously be cyclical on the hardware side because of the cycle. But we actually see given how we’ve reinvented it this time that and the teams are working on this to try to figure out, yes, we’re not just talking about new workloads, which we obviously have within our existing clients, there are not too many businesses out there. In fact, you’d be hard pressed to find one that isn’t – that doesn’t have workloads that can be – can benefit from being rewritten and run on the mainframe, given the capabilities it has.
Now that is not a process that’s going to sort itself out in two weeks. Things that run in an x86 environment, things that run on other platforms have to be reworked. They have to come into the mainframe platform. We’ve got a terrific group of developers and lab services that help the teams do that not only for existing clients, but can do it for new clients as well. So given the problems this mainframe solves, I do think that there is an opportunity for us to further expand the market by further expanding the kind of workloads and the relevance that it plays in new environments.

Thank you, Jim. Can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Q - James Schneider
Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Martin, it’s good to see that the services signings were up 25%, excuse me, at least the GTS signings up 25%. Can you maybe give us some sense about given the customer specific issues, whether you see growth – a return to growth in GTS for next year? And can you maybe comment on the kind of bookings trends you’re seeing in the GBS in particular?
A - Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks, James, so a couple of things. The team did in the – in GTS, they did a nice job in delivering pretty good signings growth. Now this is a big backlog of business and they’ve managed in the infrastructure services side to get that backlog back to be flat for the now coming out of the quarter. And they – when they look at their opportunity pool, they see a pretty good quarter in terms of signings. All of that’s going to determine whether or not we see how quickly they come back to growth in 2018 and we’ll talk more about that in January.
Within that, I think it’s important to note that the reason they’ve been successful not only in the most recent quarter, but over the long-term the reason that backlog is holding up so well and we would expect it to get back to growth with a strong signings execution is, because they are doing the most contemporary work for our clients. They are taking our clients and new clients into the kinds of cloud environments that they want.
So they’re being successful, because they are moving to the future not because they’re doing the same things that they’ve always been doing for clients. And I think the GTS team has done a nice job again in third quarter and executing some large deals, but their value proposition is as robust as it ever has been. On the GBS side, we did see growth again in the signings in the quarter. It was only 2%, which was a slowdown from where we’ve been. But three quarters of growth now and what that’s been able to do for the GBS team is get that consulting backlog back to growth in the quarter. And the team has been very focused on delivering high-value to our clients and rebuilding the skills in that consulting base in order to do that.
So the consulting backlog being up is certainly a good starting point, but the backlog in total is still down. And so as we’ve said in the past, consistent signings growth will get to backlog growth, which will get the revenue growth. And I still think they’re on that path, although we are going to have to accelerate from the low single-digit signings in order to make that go faster.
So they position themselves well in the fourth to have a lot of opportunities to try to close. We’ll see how the fourth quarter goes for GBS as well, and that too like GTS will determine how we enter 2018.
A - Patricia Murphy
Great. Thanks, Jim. Jay, can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Q - Tien-tsin Huang
Thanks. Hi, Martin and Patricia. Just I’ll ask on the transactional software side. So pretty good performance there in the third quarter. Do you feel good about that carrying into the fourth quarter, given the demand environment, as you see it today? I think you said that you’re not counting on transactional revenue in the fourth quarter. Does that mean we could see upside potential if 3Q trends persist? Just want to clarify that.
A - Martin Schroeter
Sure, Tien-tsin. So, what you heard was a fair reflection of what we’re counting on, which is, we’re not counting on continued strong growth in parts of that portfolio things like transaction processing software. But make no mistake, the team is working on driving transactional performance in parts of that business, which quite frankly, we have a pretty hot hand in. We have got a hot hand in security. We’ve got a hot hand in some of the IoT space.
So we will continue to see good growth in parts of the business. And then for software in total, our as-a-services business continues to grow quite well, and we would expect to continue to see the as-a-service performance continue to grow. As-a-service in total was up to $9.4 billion run rate when we exited, and that’s pretty good sequential improvement from where we were in the second and we’ll – we would expect that the fourth will also drive some growth.
But again, the – we’re not relying on the TPS part of the business necessarily to grow. But our customer engagement business, our security business, these are businesses that have drawn a lot of investment and they’ve got a hot hand and they’ll continue to perform.
A - Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tien-tsin. Jay, can we please take one last question?
Operator
Thank you. Our last question is coming from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.
Q - Keith Bachman
Hi, thank you very much. Martin, I also want to revisit on GBS, if I could. And the results relative to the rest of the businesses are still demonstrating challenges both on top line and on the margin profile. And the context of the question is, as you mentioned, application management is still experiencing challenge and all participants in the industry seem to be echoing the same thing.
So if application management continues to experience challenges, what are the conditions that allows GBS to improve? and in particular, as you look at FY 2018, is it – well, how should we be thinking about expectations if we just isolate on the margin profile? If application management continues to experience those challenges, is it reasonable to assume that margins could flatten out? But any comments there on- broadly on the role of ADM within the context of GBS?
A - Martin Schroeter
Sure. I mean, for us, this business is all about helping our client – helping our clients move to the cloud. So where we’re helping clients implement cloud-centric architectures, we’re moving them to next-gen apps like Salesforce and Workday and we’ve built terrific skills. We’ve even acquired skills to help accelerate this. There is plenty of room for us to both differentiate to get growth and to have good margin performance.
So in those areas which are – we’re more able to differentiate, I think there is a good future there, and that’s what the team is focused on. And then in the other parts of the business, as I mentioned, the other parts of that business where it’s more difficult to differentiate and where others who haven’t built the kind of skill base that we have are trying to get inroads, then there’s some price pressure, but that’s not the future. The future for us is helping our clients move to those cloud-centric architectures and the cloud – the next-gen apps, which is what the team is positioned themselves well to continue to do not only in the fourth, but going into 2018.
End of Q&A
Martin Schroeter
So let me wrap up the call and first, by saying thanks for joining us today. As we said at the start of the year and then we reiterated again in July, we said we see improved trajectories in the second half of the year relative to the first half then we talked about the drivers of that change. Our third quarter performance certainly reinforced that. And while we have more to get done in the fourth, it shows we’re on the right course. And it also shows quite frankly, that our confidence in our strategy is very well placed. So thanks again for joining us today and we’ll talk to you in January.
Patricia Murphy

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. In the second quarter, we delivered $19.3 billion of revenue, operating pretax income of over $3 billion, operating earnings per share of $2.97, and free cash flow of over $2.5 billion. The quarter played out as we expected with continued solid growth in our strategic imperatives which now really reflects organic growth. We wrapped on the acquisitive content and we're at the stage where we can start to get some efficiency as a result of bringing them into IBM while we build on the new content.
Our gross margin is up over 2.5 point sequentially and positions us for the continued improvement over the course of the year we talked about 90 days ago. And we had good free cash flow performance all again as we expected. In the second quarter we signed a number of large contracts in global technology services and again, grew our global business services signings, both of which will start to contribute in the second half. And since the quarter ended, we announced our new IBM Z system which will be available later this quarter. With all of this we expect improved performance in revenue and gross margin in the second half and we continue to expect at least $13.80 of operating EPS and free cash flow consistent with last year.
I'll spend time on the first to second half dynamics a little later and you will see it's very similar to what we talked about in April. We've been focused on helping our enterprise clients transform their businesses to leverage their data for competitive advantage and to improve the efficiency and agility of their IT environments. Our strategic imperatives performance has been an indication of our progress in moving to these areas. As you know, our strategic imperatives are in separate businesses but signpost that represent the revenue across our business lines that work together to address demand for analytics, cloud security, mobile and social. Our clients are taking the productivity savings we're delivering to them in the more traditional areas of IT and reinvesting those savings to move into these new areas; these are the dynamics you've seen in our revenue.
In the quarter, our strategic imperatives revenue was up 7% at constant currency which as I said is pretty much all organic growth. Over the last twelve months, revenue from our strategic imperatives was up 12% to over $34 billion and now represents 43% of IBM. As is typical, I'll focus on constant currency growth rates throughout. A large part of our strategic imperatives are delivered as a service. Our as a service revenue was up over 30% in the second, and we exited the quarter with an $8.8 billion annual run rate. IBM's cloud revenue on a trailing twelve month basis is now over $15 billion, that's nearly 20% of IBM's revenue. Let me spend a minute underscoring how we've been able to build cloud to a $15 billion business, and why enterprises are increasingly moving to the IBM cloud.
In the second quarter we added more leading companies to the IBM cloud. For example, Lloyds Bank has chosen the IBM cloud. Lloyds is one of the most advanced digital banks in the world and they expect to become even more agile by leveraging IBM's unique combination of private and public cloud capabilities. American Airlines is also using the IBM cloud as the foundation for this broadbased cloud transformation. Clients are choosing the IBM cloud for a number of reasons. First, our cloud is hybrid, built for the enterprise, that's public and private, and integrated with on-prime [ph] data and workloads. Second, they want to leverage our expertise in industry and their existing business processes and systems, and we know how to migrate them from one era to the next. Third, they trust IBM and the IBM cloud to protect and preserve not only their data but also their insights and AI training engines to ensure all of the value from their data accrues to them versus going to educative central knowledge graph.
And of course, we continue to add state-of-the-art tools and technologies to exploit enterprise data in the cloud; this includes Watson and blockchain. You see this last point cloud as companies deploy IBM blockchain and Watson solutions in the cloud. Recently, we announced an agreement with a consortium of seven of Europe's top banks to create a new blockchain service for trade finance for the small and medium business market. And in Australia, we're working with banks to launch new commercial property leasing services based on blockchain. And remember, we're already working with many others including DTCC, CLS and Northern Trust. Beyond financial services we're working with industry leaders like Walmart and Food Safety and Maersk in shipping. It's still early but we see a lot of opportunity leveraging block chain in the cloud and across multiple industries.
Similarly in the second quarter we saw Watson deployments continue to expand globally. The cognitive opportunity is a global one, it's not centered in New York or Boston or Silicon Valley; but you can't just look and listen in those places. In healthcare alone, you'd miss that this quarter the first healthcare provider in Latin America is deploying Watson for oncology, and Baheal Pharmaceutical Group is bringing Watson for genomics to clinicians across China. In fact, 80% of the hospitals who've adopted Watson for oncology are outside of the U.S., and that's just healthcare, we have Watson deployed with other leaders like Berdasco [ph], Honda and Vodafone as well. So across industries and around the world our clients realize that data, in fact their own data is the route of competitive advantage for all companies.
Remember, 80% of the worlds data is owned by enterprises, it's not searchable on the worldwide web, it's customer data, and patient data, clinical data, supply chain data, transaction data and companies want to unlock and exploit that data; and so that's why enterprises will move to cognitive on the cloud with someone they trust who has leading tools and industry expertise and a data model and business model consistent with their goals, that is the IBM cloud plus Watson.
I want to also remind you of the importance of the underlying technology stack. We've continued to reinvent the mainframe and our power platform to address the most contemporary enterprise workloads. Our new z14 mainframe is a great example. With a breakthrough in data encryption, IBM Z is capable of encrypting all data associated with any application, service or database all of the time and with no application change and no performance impact. Think about what that means for addressing global data breaches, the increase in government regulations and block chain opportunities. It's the biggest reinvention of our mainframe technology since the reinvention for Linux and open source software 15 years ago.
I'll touch on additional progress and examples of where we're winning in these areas and more details on our new mainframe capabilities as I go through the segment discussions. But first, I'll walk through our financial metrics.
Our revenue for the quarter was $19.3 billion, which is down 3% at constant currency. As expected, we had a larger currency headwind to revenue growth, it was about twice the impact of the first quarter. I mentioned earlier that we ramped on the acquisitions we completed in early 2016. We had two points of benefit in the first quarter from acquisitions and only about 40 basis points in the second. So excluding the acquisitive content, our year-to-year revenue performance was a modest improvement over last quarters rate. When you look at our revenue performance by geography, in the Americas, revenue in the U.S. was down while we had solid growth in Canada and Latin America. Our overall performance in Europe declined centered in Germany and the UK.
You will recall, last quarter I talked about the impact of the conclusion of services contracts in those countries which will continue through the year that will get some benefit from the new deals we signed in the second half. We had sequential improvement in Asia Pacific with growth in several markets including Japan which is our second largest country. I'll come back to the revenue trajectory later in the call.
When you look at our gross profit, our margin was down year-to-year but significantly better than the first quarter year-to-year performance. The year-to-year margin decline reflects both the mix and invests. From first to second quarter we got substantial leverage from our high value model. We added $1 billion gross profit from first to second with $1.1 billion of additional revenue, while last year we had similar gross profit improvement from first to second but we needed more revenue to do it. So that of course resulted in improved trajectory in the year-to-year margin dynamics; in fact, we had sequential improvement in the year-to-year gross margin performance in each of our five segments. We'll talk more about the drivers and trends in the segment discussions.
Our expense was down 6% versus last year with about half of that due to currency and the balance reflects an increased focus on driving efficiency in our spend base. As I said, we've been shifting and adding resources as we invest to build solutions and platforms. In fact, in the first half of this year we hired 20,000 people into the business; so our cost and expense profile reflects a balance between investing in key areas and driving efficiency across the spend base. Our operating pretax profit was nearly $3.1 billion which is up about a $1 billion from the first quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15% consistent with last quarter.
We also had discrete tax benefits in the second quarter of about $170 million or $0.18 of operating EPS. We generated $2.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter and net income margin of 14.5% which is up 50 basis points year-to-year. On the bottom line, our operating EPS was $2.97. We generated over $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter which is up year-to-year, and over the last twelve months our free cash flow is 94% of our GAAP net income.
So now turning to our segments, cognitive solutions had $4.6 billion of revenue, continued growth in annuity content led by SaaS and an improved margin profile. Our annuity content which represents 80% of cognitive was up 2% year-to-year driven by roughly 4.5% growth in solution software. We had strong SaaS performance with strong double-digit growth in signings and revenue again this quarter. Revenue was up nearly 30%. As our SaaS business grows, we continue to invest to build scale. The software transaction revenue was down double-digits due to declines in some of our license based offerings and as you know, this was a larger impact in the second quarter given the seasonality of our transactions. As we've said before, many of our license-based offerings are high value but in declining markets.
We also wrapped on most of our acquisitions and are focused on investing to combine organic and acquired content to build cloud-based cognitive offerings. Let me talk about the progress we're making in parts of the solution software portfolio.
In analytics, we saw good growth in Watson health and Watson financial services and in BI and data discovery lead by Cognos. We announced the partnership with Hortonworks to combine our data science experience in machine learning with Hortonworks data platform to allow developers to access data science and cognitive tools and create intelligent apps. We also had strong growth in our Watson platform which underpins our enterprise AI strategy as we build scale. Conversation API usage and the number of active users are up strong double-digits quarter-to-quarter as we helped clients embed cognitive into their workflows. For example, credit mutual is live with multiple used cases including virtual systems for insurance and savings.
These cognitive applications were rolled out to over 20,000 agents across France enhancing their quality of service for 12 million customers. In this quarter we added new partners like LivePerson which provides a conversational platform used for the customer care needs of over 18,000 businesses. Given the growing relevance of AI in digital channels, they announced a new offering called LiveEngage with Watson to transform the customer care space. LiveEngage can offer intelligent personalized digital support to each customer; this is an appealing market, the value Watson provides depends on the complexity of the conversation, so the number of API calls can vary but we have the potential to deliver value from every digital conversation. This will scale as more of today's 270 billion customer support phone call shift to digital interactions.
Within our vertical strategy, Watson Health had strong growth, particularly in the areas of state and local government agencies and oncology as we continue scaling. While market uncertainty persists, government agencies still face the realities of having to deliver services more efficiently; and our analytics and social program management offerings can help clients make better informed decisions to reduce healthcare costs and reduce outcomes. Both offerings drove strong growth this quarter; oncology is also scaling and is now in over 50 hospitals on five continents. Through the first half Watson has worked with nearly 40,000 patients and doctors and this will grow to approximately 100,000 by year end and many of these have life-threatening diseases such as cancer.
Watson for oncology alone has a potential to reach millions around the world based just on the hospital systems we've engaged to date. So we're just at the beginning of scaling, we continue to add new cancer types so our patient reach continues to grow. We're not just scaling our business into new areas but also improving deployment; for example, we implemented Watson for oncology at Baheal Pharmaceutical Group in less than a month. This quarter as I mentioned earlier, we expanded with Baheal into genomics. We also announced the new collaboration with Hackensack Meridian Health, a prominent U.S. provider to combine Watson for Oncology with their real world data to help oncologists improve cancer treatment and reduce costs.
For another industry example, Watson for Financial Services which includes the [indiscernible] acquisition, also contributed to growth this quarter. We launched industry expert trained AI risk and compliance solutions including anti-money laundering and know your customer. Beyond verticals, security, including security services which is reported in technology services and cloud platforms grew again this quarter. Offerings like QRadar and Resilient had strong growth as customers look to strengthen their ability to both the tax and respond to security threats. This quarter we announced the partnership with Cisco to address this growing threat of cyber crime. We will collaborate on threat intelligence research by sharing data, integrating our offerings and coordinating on major cyber security incidence.
Turning to profit, cognitive solutions gross margin is down year-to-year though improving sequentially driven by the continued investment into strategic areas including acquisitions and the mix towards SaaS. Cognitive pretax income is up year-to-year and this segment has very high PTI margins which expanded again this quarter, even with a high level of investment as we continue to embed cognitive into offerings, build and scale platforms and drive vertical solutions. In global business services, we grew signings for the second consecutive quarter and had modest improvement in the year-to-year revenue performance as compared to first.
As we've talked about, we've realigned our practice model to improve productivity and focus our strategy around three growth platforms. The first platform is where we help our clients build and execute digital strategies. Next is where we help our clients re-engineer their core processes. And the third platform is where we modernize our clients applications and move them to the cloud. This differentiated strategy is beginning to take hold as we accelerated our signings growth in GBS this quarter. Our cloud, mobile and analytics practices delivered strong revenue growth. Though consulting revenue was down 1%, our trajectory improved again this quarter with strong growth in our digital offerings. We continue to decline in traditional enterprise application work as we shift resources away from these areas to new areas such as SAP HANA, Workday and Salesforce.
We've talked about the path to improvement in GBS which starts with consistent signings growth which adds to the backlog and then ultimately revenue. Our consulting backlog this quarter was nearly flat year-to-year after several quarters of declines. We expect the consulting trajectory improvement to continue in the second half. Our mobile practice continues to expand with a portfolio of cognitive enabled enterprise iOS apps that can redesign our clients workflows. This quarter we announced new initiatives at several different clients including Lufthansa Group and Singapore Airlines. Application management was down 1%, that's been relatively stable over the past several quarters. Clients continue to look to us to manage the lifecycle of their critical applications. We help them move to new cloud architectures that improve the speed and agility of their operations by leveraging the value of their current systems and data.
Turning to profit; GBS gross profit margin was up over a point sequentially. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we added more gross profit dollars than we did a year ago, and we were able to do this on less incremental revenue. This was evidenced for the turnaround that we expect in GBS as we move forward. We continue to shift to higher value work while focusing on improving productivity. We yield at savings from workforce actions and continue to invest to remix our skills. While we're seeing pricing pressure in the areas that are not as differentiated, we continue to focus on capturing the value of our new offerings. We've streamlined our practice infrastructure and are driving efficiencies in our delivery model for new methods and project management approaches.
In summary, in GBS this quarter we continued many of the improving trends that started in the first quarter. As we've said before, the starts with consistent signings growth and we grew signings for the second consecutive quarter. We continue to shift to our high value strategic imperative and we're starting to see the benefits from a redesign practice model and refocused growth strategy. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities; put all this together, and we expect to see continued improvement in GBS in the second half.
In technology services and cloud platforms, we delivered a $8.4 billion of revenue. While revenue performance decelerated, our margin profile improved compared to last quarter and we signed a number of contracts that will contribute to improved performance in the second half. The deceleration was driven by infrastructure services as we ramped on some acquisitive content and shifted away from lower value work. While this shift impacted our revenue, it contributed to the improved gross margin trajectory. We also continue to be impacted by some large contracts that concluded, particularly in Europe, which we talked about last quarter.
Our business model and infrastructure services is one where we're constantly delivering productivity to our clients. Our clients trust us with their most critical IT operations as we continue to leave this space. The way that we expand our footprint is by helping clients move to cloud and drive new workloads by acquiring new scope and new clients. This quarter we were able to close some substantial new transactions including a six-year $700 million agreement with Bombardier; we'll move them to the IBM cloud and help integrate their operations globally. This will drive productivity, improve their agility and ultimately provide competitive advantage.
I mentioned Lloyds where we signed a 10-year cloud agreement valued at around $1.5 billion. We'll move the bank to the IBM cloud and migrate their application suites to this infrastructure. And earlier this quarter, we entered into a definitive agreement for the large Telco to acquire it's cloud and managed hosting business. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2017. We're working with them on a number of other strategic initiatives including networking and cloud services. These transactions will help improve our revenue trajectory in the second half. Technical support services revenue was down 1%, a point better than last quarter's rate.
We continue to grow in our multi-vendor support services where we provide wall-to-wall support for our clients IT operations. Integration software revenue was down 1% which is nearly two points better than the first quarters rate. Our annuity base remains stable with strong growth in SaaS across our offerings including webs for your application server and our hybrid transformation and connect the cloud offerings. Transactional revenue within integration software declined as more of this portfolio shifts to the IBM cloud which will benefit us overtime. Across the segment we delivered strong growth in cloud analytics, mobile and security. The service run rate for the segment increased to $5.8 billion.
Clients are moving to the IBM cloud because it's built for the enterprise and can optimize workloads across hybrid environments. The underline architecture protects our clients data and insights and is optimized for cognitive workloads to help our clients create new business models. The American Airlines example I referenced earlier is a great example where we're building on the partnership we signed last year. American Airlines announced this quarter they will move to the IBM cloud and use it as the foundation for their digital transformation. They will migrate critical applications including AA.com, their customer facing mobility app and their global network of kiosks.
Looking at profit, gross profit margin for the segment was down year-to-year but up a point sequentially. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we added about the same gross profit dollars we did a year ago on less than half of the incremental revenue, so you can see the leverage you can get in this business. We drove efficiencies and services delivery and yielded savings from workforce actions. We've been investing in our automation capabilities and launched the IBM services platform with Watson last week. This platform offers next-generation enterprise IT services using cognitive technology and will drive operational efficiencies and improve delivery performance for our clients.
We also continue to invest in our IBM cloud capabilities. We announced the opening of four new cloud centers in the U.S. extending our capacity with centers in key local markets across 19 different countries. This provides enterprises with the ability to run their data and applications locally and meet regulatory requirements. Clients can provision cloud infrastructure when in where they needed.
In summary, for technology services in cloud platforms, infrastructure services revenue decelerated given the ramp on some acquisitive content and the shift away from lower value work given some of the significant transactions we closed this quarter and strong demand for our cloud services, we expect our revenue trajectory to improve in the second half. We also expect the improved trends in profit to continue.
In systems this quarter we had a significant improvement in our year-to-year revenue trajectory and an improved margin profile quarter-to-quarter. This is the second quarter in a row with growth in storage. Our power declines moderated and our mainframe business is consistent with what you would expect at the end of the cycle. Mainframe and storage margins grew year-to-year and power margins improved sequentially. Our overall systems margin was down year-to-year reflecting mix largely due to product transitions.
In Z systems as I mentioned, our results are reflective of being in the tenth and final quarter of the z13 product cycle. Revenue declined year-to-year, gross margin expanded and we added four new clients this quarter for a total of 91 since the launch of z13. We continue to deliver innovation on the platform in support of our clients evolving workload needs. For example, a large bank in Europe selected Linux One as the strategic platform for their BPM deployments which will help the bank achieve significant savings over the next five years. Few large government clients expanded their mainframe capacity helping them drive down the operating cost for these agencies.
In the areas of new workloads, we had wins in both blockchain and instant payments. The blockchain wins were geographically disperse as we help our clients around the world tackle business challenges with the emerging blockchain technology. We closed three instant payment deals in Europe to help our banking clients comply with the EU payment modernization initiative.
I want to spend a minute on our new z14 mainframe that we announced yesterday. After three years of development and working with more than 150 clients, this is the world's most powerful transaction system capable of running more than 12 billion encrypted transactions per day and provides breakthrough pervasive encryption. This data encryption engine encrypts all data associated with any application, cloud service or database all of the time without the possibility of human intervention, and that's with no application change and no performance impact.
We took on this challenge to address both the global data breach epidemic and the need to operate within government regulations. In fact, of the 9 billion records breached in the past five years, only 4% were encrypted. Even with the rise of cloud data centers, little real progress have been made encrypting data at any scale because it's hard, expensive and it impacts performance, that is until now. Our new z14 system encrypts data 18 times faster than x86 platforms and the x86 platforms are 20 times more expensive. The reason why 92 of the worlds Top 100 banks rely on the mainframe is for it's high value, secure and scalable platform.
The reason they stay on it is because of it's appeal in new workloads and the advances we continue to make in the underlying technologies to address these. Like the new z14 with this unprecendented encryption capabilities, and we do this with increased performance at lower cost which is really valuable to our enterprise clients. So we can deliver all of this within an economic equation that works at the scale required by our clients. The power growth rate improved sequentially but was still down, the improvement reflects our transition to our growing Linux market while continuing to serve a high value but declining Unix market. Our Linux on power revenue grew and we gained share. We again had double-digit growth in Linux workloads. HANA on Power continues to play an important role in that success.
By contrast in Unix, the clients were driven by our low end and mid-range systems, high-end systems grew. Our power portfolio is focused on cognitive and cloud opportunities and we continue to expand capabilities and partnerships. During the second quarter we announced new integrated offerings with Hortonworks designed to help everyone from data scientists to business leaders better analyze and manage their data and accelerate decision-making. And we announced integrated offerings with new 10X [ph] to deliver hyper-converted solutions targeting critical workloads in large enterprises.
We also announced the new version of Power AI which paired with IBM Linux HPC servers reduces training of deep learning from weeks to hours. I'll remind you that will bring the next-generation Power 9 to market in the fourth quarter starting with two U.S. department of energy funded national labs. There are three labs of this type but no vendor can win more than two, so we won over-aloud [ph]. These will be the worlds most advanced data-centric supercomputing systems and we'll rollout Power 9 across the power portfolio throughout 2018.
Storage hardware was up again this quarter increasing 8% led by strong double-digit growth and our all-flash array offerings. Flash was the growth catalyst in our storage mid-range and high-end offerings. Storage hardware margins increased both, year-to-year and sequentially. So to summarize systems, our year-to-year revenue and gross margin trajectory improved with consecutive quarters of revenue growth in storage offset by the expected cycle driven declines in Z systems and Power. While we face some shifting market dynamics and product transitions, our portfolio remains optimized for cognitive and cloud, and we continue to expand our footprint and add new capabilities. Our recent z14 launch and the upcoming Power refresh beginning later in the year, will drive further improvements in second half performance.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, in the second quarter we generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations excluding our financing receivables. We invested about three quarters of $1 billion in capital expenditures focused in our Watson and cloud platform areas, as well as in support of our services and systems businesses. And so we generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow which is up almost $350 million year-to-year; this reflects continued strong collections performance for the second consecutive quarter. For the first half our free cash flow was $3.6 billion and over the last 12 months our cash realization rate is 94%, four points higher than last quarters trailing 12 months rate.
The first half free cash flow of $3.6 billion is down $900 million year-to-year. However, you will recall in the first half of last year we had a $1.2 billion Japan tax refund. As we look forward to the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be roughly flat with last year with the first half year-to-year headwind switching to a tailwind in the second half from taxes and workforce rebalancing payments. And of course, this reflects the level of profit consistent with our full year view of earnings per share.
Looking at uses of cash in the half, our acquisition spend was relatively light after a significant number of acquisitions in 2015 and early 2016. We're focused on investing and integrating these acquisitions as we expand our solutions and cloud capabilities. In the last six months, we've returned $5.5 billion to shareholders, including $2.7 billion in dividends. In April, we again raised our dividend and with that we've more than doubled our dividends since 2010. In the first half we bought back over 60 million shares and we ended June with 932 million shares outstanding and $2.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended June with $12.3 billion in cash and $45.7 billion in total debt. Both of these are up from year-end, primarily driven by the timing of this years term debt issuances and maturities. $29 billion of our total debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 9:1 [ph] and the portfolio remains strong at 53% investment grade. We've got more in our financing business and our supplemental charts at the back of the presentation. Our balance sheet remains strong and with our newly reorganized financing entity, we're even better positioned to support our business over the long-term.
Let me start to wrap up by putting some additional perspective on our revenue trajectory, and we'll look at it by segment because our businesses are at different stages of transformation. In global business services, we've said for sometime that the progression is driven by improvement in signings leading to backlog and then ultimately revenue. I plant the flag to mark the beginning of an improvement and the revenue growth trajectory for GBS back in the fourth quarter of last year. And we've now had two consecutive quarters of signings growth, substantial improvements in the consulting backlog and a modest 20 basis point improvement in GBS revenue performance from first to second. This is what improving momentum in the services business looks like. So now with this momentum and a more focused set of offerings and improvements in execution, we've seen improved trajectory in GBS in the second half.
In global technology services with decelerating performance over the last two quarters, we're planning to flag now at the end of the second quarter. With the ramp in some of our new contracts, we do expect improved performance in the second half but we're not counting on a return to revenue growth this year, just an improved revenue trajectory. And at systems, storage had been declining but you will remember we plant the flag as we got all flash into the product line towards the end of last year and we've now had two consecutive quarters of revenue growth. Power, I'd similarly plant the flag back at the end of last year; and for systems Z mainframe, growth is tied more to the nine to ten quarter product cycle which will refresh later this quarter.
Finally, in cognitive solutions, we've now wrapped on our acquisitions. Our annuity content continues to grow, this was driven in large part by our SaaS offerings and as we've talked about in the past, they ramp and build scale over a longer timeframe. Put it all together and we expect improvement in the constant currency growth rate through the rest of the year.
Now when we look at gross margin, I mentioned three drivers of our year-to-year performance in the first half. We've seen some moderations in the headwinds from mix and investments already from first to second and I'd expect that to continue. We're always driving productivity in the business and much of that gets returned to our clients in the form of price, or it offset cyclical impacts or it goes to the bottom line. In the first half, the net of these factors was an impact to our margin but as we move to the second half with new product introduction and improved services dynamics, I'd expect this to be a benefit to our margin.
With that altogether, and just as we expect improvement in our revenue trajectory, we also expect an improved gross margin profile in the second half as compared to the first. So in total, those drivers of our first to second half performance improvements are consistent with what we talked about 90 days ago. We'll have a new IBM Z product out by the end of the quarter which will drive an improvement in gross profit from first to second half. Related to that, we'll also benefit from lower systems development spending.
The new services contracts and global technology services will start to contribute and with the cost savings we're driving, we'll have better performance in GTS. In global business services we expect the momentum to deliver a better second half. We've essentially wrapped on last year's larger acquisitions which are dilutive to profit and we're not at the stage where we can start to yield more benefits from operational synergies. Our ongoing operational tax rate assumption continues to be 15% plus or minus three points driven by our anticipated mix.
As always, this is without discrete items but the rate is dependant on the mix of business because just like every dollar of revenue doesn't result in the same amount of gross profit, every dollar of gross profit doesn't drive the same amount of after-tax profit. But at the bottom-line, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017 and free cash flow that is consistent with last year.
And with that, we'll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So operator, lets please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty
Yes, thank you, good afternoon. I appreciate the second half versus first half color but if you can comment more specifically on the third quarter because of the mainframe launch; consensus is modeling both better revenue and better EPS growth sequentially than last year. Are you comfortable with those boggies? And maybe in regard of that just talk about how you think this mainframe cycle will compare to past cycles? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure Katy, thanks, and thanks for joining the call. I guess a couple of things, I'll start actually where you finished on mainframe because we have in the past said that the economics for the mainframe for us, what we're looking for is that the overall economic equation cycle-to-cycle kind of holds and we saw for the last four mainframes, including the one that we just finished and now we expect the overall economic equation to be fairly stable, that doesn't map to a calendar period of it because we announced them at different times but we would expect the overall economics of the mainframe to hold cycle-to-cycle the cycle amount to the fifth cycle, we could have gone back further but let's just say that mainframe is roughly consistent with the past.
In terms of third and fourth quarter, I guess there are couple of things. I think you're interested in revenue and we'll talk about EPS as well and then where does the mainframe fit. On the revenue side of that typically we see about -- for seasonal reasons, we see about $1 billion 2Q to 3Q reduction for seasonality. Now we're only going to have a month or less of the new mainframe, we're going to have a month of some of these new contracts, not the full quarter, those will come in the fourth and so that typical $1 billion impact will be helped a little bit, $200 million to $300 million by mainframe or the services contract but that's about it for the third and then obviously the rest will be in the fourth.
And then from an earnings perspective, given the power of the mainframe and the profit equation, how it helps mix plus our typical -- you know, typically we have a lot of our transaction business in the fourth. When you look at our EPS guidance, we're up a little bit for the year; we're up even less than the full year now through the first half. And then third quarter I wouldn't expect to drive much growth at all. I think most of the growth rate is going to be in the fourth, again, given the cycle dynamics and quite frankly, given the fact that the benefit really is only a month now and three months of the fourth. Thanks, Katy.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy. Can we take the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. Martin, your cognitive solutions, pretax margins were up nicely, both on a quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year basis despite some continued weakness on the transactional business. Can you address what the main drivers there were for cognitive margins and PTI specifically was at lower drag from M&A, better contribution from the SaaS assets and do you see that sustained continued sort of year-on-year improvement in the second half for cognitive PTI margins? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, thanks Wamsi. Well, you've kind of answered your question, so well done. No it is -- it really is a reflection of a few things. One is sequentially we've got a benefit from scale, now that's annual, that's year-to-year as well as sequential, but we're getting a benefit from scale as we build those service businesses. And then just like when we wrap on an acquisition and the revenue benefit, at the same time that allows us -- not allows us but what we start to do is we start to build the consolidation if you will and the efficiency in getting those acquisitions onto our own platform; so we get kind of local expense savings if you will from doing things once as opposed to a number of times around a unit. So better scale, ramping acquisitions, not only on the growth but then we get an opportunity to get a bit more productivity out of them. And yes, those -- I would expect that margins in cognitive solutions while on a year-to-year basis we still see -- because of mix we still see a year-to-year decline, sequentially we'll continue to improve on those things, the things I identified; the scale will last forever and then the wrap on the acquisitions will start to deteriorate in another three or four quarters.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Wamsi. Can we please take the next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steve Milunovich
Thank you. Martin you made a number of positive comments about the trajectory of services but the supplemental slides, the signings overall are down 14% year-over-year and the backlog is now down to 4% year-over-year. What's going on there and why do you think that's going to improve?
Martin Schroeter
Yes, couple of things Steve. First, let's pull signings, we'll talk about backlog because the impact of signings on backlog, as you know we've talked about it is different when it's a renewal versus when it's new business and siginings, they don't playout as we said in the past on a 90-day period, obviously the longer you get, the more it looks like your backlog but you got to get over a pretty long timeframe in order to have the signings translate directly into backlog. So in the first half of this year we had one of the biggest new contract signings we've had for any six month period as big as it was; last year it was bigger than the year before. So what happens in our backlog is those new contracts come on once we go through the transition period, as I mentioned earlier and that for us it will start to be September, once you get through that transition period, all of that translates to revenue rather quickly, that's different from a backlog or signing that goes into backlog as an extension of a contract that's ten years old and is about to expire because that is not going to drive any incremental growth.
So yes, on GTS the backlog is down, the new signings go in though at a rate that will drive revenue in the near-term and so the backlog being down is something we obviously have to work on a few years out because those contracts are going to come due and we have to get them renewed because it's not going to drive any growth but we need the backlog. And on GBS, we had second quarter in a row of good signings, performance, in fact an acceleration from the first and within their backlog now, as we noted in our prepared remarks, our consulting business now has gotten itself back to kind of a flat backlog which in the near-term that tends to yield pretty quickly as we deliver; so they were battling double-digit declines in backlog for a while, they worked their way out of that spiral; and so we'll see a near-term yield on the consulting side as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Steve. Operator, can we please take the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Ingin Wang with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Ingin Wang
Hi, thanks for the update. Just on the strategic comparative, it's up 7%; is high single digit a good proxy for organic growth and strategic comparative for the year because you hired the efficiency I think. Martin, [indiscernible] and the focus was due more towards maybe margin, then revenue acceleration within strategic comparatives?
Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Ingin. A couple of things I think worth noting. Yes, we certainly ramped on the acquisitions and so this is a pretty good proxy for the organic piece and it is mostly as a service, right, so it's not going to drive the same impact on our big base of business as it would if you ramped on an on-prime business because it didn't have the same impact to begin with. Now -- by the way we're not out of the acquisition business, right, we're still active acquirers, we just happen to ramp on and are getting our feet under us on everything we did in the past 18 months but we are still active acquirer. So that will drive some of the growth but when we think about strategic imperatives, going forward I would expect that we get a bit of an acceleration from the new mainframe, power will drive a bit and quite frankly, the services contracts, particularly the new ones that we signed and we talked about, they are cloud contracts, they are to help our clients build and run clouds and move them onto the cloud.
So just like we've encouraged everyone to look at the strategic imperatives on a trailing 12 month basis which they we're at 11% on a trailing 12 month basis; with the acceleration now through the back half of the year, when we get to the end of this year, I'd expect us to be still on that same trailing 12 months, so the whole calendar year I'd expect us to be in that 10% to 11% range on strategic imperatives as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Ingin. Can we go to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes, thank you. Martin, I was wondering if you could just quickly clarify, I think you said you didn't expect EPS growth in Q3. Consensus is looking for $0.09 year-over-year improvement in Q3; are you suggesting that's not something that's appropriate? And then more specifically, my question -- for strategic imperatives, it sounds like you feel organic growth is 7%, are you still confident overall growth will be 10% plus which is something you articulated at your investment day? And if you are, is the proper implication to think about three points of strategic imperative growth coming from acquisitions which is about $1 billion a year in acquisition revenue; is that sort of the framework by which we should think? And are you still confident in that double-digit sustained growth for strategic imperatives? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, thanks Toni. So first on the non-question clarifying piece; look, we've got a base $3 plus on a base, we're roughly flat, I think we're at a level now where it's just too fine a number in order to say am I talking about $0.09 on a three -- almost mid-three, anyway, it's a big base, $0.09, too fine for me. On strategic imperatives, again, you know, I do expect us to accelerate in the second half for the year for the reasons we've talked about, right; we get new mainframe, a lot of the new contracts are coming on. And then the other elements within this and you can actually see it in the segment charts, we've got good growth in technology services and cloud platforms on the strategic imperative base, that is organic. We have good growth in GBS, that is by large organic. We have slower growth in the cognitive solutions but that's a massive base.
And then obviously what -- where we'll accelerate the most in the second half is the systems business which was down dramatically in the quarter but again, we're at the part of the cycle here where we would expect it to be down, so we gave the segment view already when we changed the segment reporting, we gave the segment view so you could try to put together now where we see that shift of business coming from. And as we go into second half, I think the most profound shifts are going to be in the systems business, we'll see continued good growth in the technology services cloud platforms unit, we could see continued good growth in GBS.
And then cognitive; you know, we have made investments, we're getting growth out of that part of the business, it is as a service primarily and therefore it's impact on the overall is more muted but if we were to acquire something it would go -- it would likely go back in there. But again, it's more muted because it's via the service business.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Toni. Can we go to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open.
David Grossman
Thank you. And perhaps Martin you addressed some of this in the last question but I was hoping you could help us better understand the growth dynamics in the cognitive and GBS segments. It looks like the strategic imperatives are well over 50% of the revenue mix in both of those units but they both are experiencing revenue declines; so if I've got that math right, can you help us better understand that dynamic and what that implies for the overall mix as strategic imperatives increase the greater percent of IBM's overall revenue mix?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, David. So we'll do it kind of piece by piece and I'll give you two words trying to describe both of them. One is magnitude, and I'm going to put that against cognitive; we've got -- it's a big, big business and obviously the service that we're building, it has a smaller impact and so we see growth but it's going to take -- and we're getting growth and they as a service portfolio but it's going to take time to build that and part of that portfolio, TPS, our transaction processing business as we have on the slide is down four, so that's a very high value business but it's a big on-prem [ph] business that it's going to take a while to outbuild if you will from as a service perspective.
And then on GBS, the word I'd give you is the transition. So I described a bit on our consulting business where we got the backlog back and back to flat and the consulting business has accelerated, the signings in consulting are good, the things that the growth is quite strong, the things that we're engaging with our clients on digital offering, those are resonating. So the consulting business comes back pretty well than the application management business; it's a fairly stable business and yes, we're helping our clients move those into clouds, we're helping them contemporize if you will, the way those applications work but that's not a big growth engine, it really is kind of a very stable base.
And then in GPS, in our global processing systems business, that's not high content of strategic imperatives but it is important work for our client and it's quite valuable to us. So in GBS as we make this transition, you know, the overall will be lifted and as we said we planted the flag on revenue growth back in the fourth quarter, now we've seen a moderately improving trajectory now and we would expect -- as I said the prepared remarks that third and fourth would be better again in terms of trajectory and revenue.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Let's take the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Amit Daryanani
Perfect, thanks a lot, good afternoon guys. I guess just trying to understand the gross margin discussion Martin, I realize 180 basis points decline in June is much better than the 300 basis points decline you had in the March quarter; but at what point do you see gross margins from a year-over-year perspective starting to stabilize and does stability in gross margin have to come in-line with strategic revenues essentially decelerating a little bit?
Martin Schroeter
Well, we do see as we said in the prepared remarks that we do see continued improvement in the trajectory, right. So down three in the first, down 18 in the second and then second half, driven by both mix and driven by the work we have underway in delivering productivity across our services platform, the work we have in improving our GBS margins which is now starting to come -- to show up in the ledger. So we see both, a mix of kind of structural benefits from productivity, we see a mix of execution benefits from realizing if you will the higher value of the solutions we're selling and we see a mix from just the fact that we're in high value systems business which is going to mix more strongly. So yes, we do see continued gross margin improvement on a sequential basis and improvement on a year-to-year basis sequentially, and that would position us pretty well I think then for 2018 but we've got work to do here in the second half to put that on the table but we do see it in the third and the fourth.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Amit. Let's go to the next question please.
Operator
Our next question is from Brain White [ph] with [indiscernible]. You may ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Martin on the z14, it sounds like it will have an impact, a positive impact in the second half of the year; do you think it will have a more favorable impact in 2018? And if you could give us just some guide post around the attach rate of the z14 or any mainframe cycle to both sales and profits of IBM, obviously it's a small direct percent of IBM's total sales and profits but if you look at the overall portfolio and the software and services that it ranks through that would be great. Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
So first, I think what you started by saying was z14 not much impact in second half and I think what we're saying is that it's going to have quite an impact in the second half, right. It was announced yesterday, it will become publicly available in September and so we'll get a month in the quarter but we'll get three months of it in the fourth quarter. So just to make sure we're clear, we do see a pretty good impact here in the second half from Z. Now the timing that impact will be most profound in the systems space because the hardware is what obviously goes out first. We also provide as you know, we provide maintenance for that but the warranty period is on, so that's not going to be sold for until after the warranty period expires, that's in 12 months plus. There is a software that goes with it but that tends to be driven by usage, not by a placement of hardware and so that also isn't going to be in the second half. We financed these, right, that happens overtime and so we get that money back overtime.
So the -- and then we sell storage, there is a little bit of tailwind in the hardware side but again a lot of it is software defined storage, so the benefit in the second half is systems driven, the rest of the platform if you will, will continue to drive profit overtime and a lot of that will been dependant on the workloads that it can attract and the workload is running [ph] now and how people scale which we feel quite good about. You know, one of the things we haven't spend a lot of time on, on the mainframe because the interest has been around security, the interest has been around in-line machine learning but one of the elements of the new mainframe is new software model which will allow our clients to partition off parts of the mainframe and run new workloads and test new workloads in a much more economic way so they will attract new workloads onto the platform again.
So in overtime, again, we're not relying on the mainframe as a platform to be anymore valuable it has in the past but I'll tell you what this mainframe solves a lot of problems at clients who don't use it today, have; and it provides a lot of new on-ramps for other workloads.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Brian. Can we please take the next question.

Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask your question.
Jim Suva
Thanks very much, it's Jim Suva from Citi. Martin, you had mentioned [indiscernible] several times in different parts of the businesses which is greatly appreciated. The question I have for you is, is there any correlation to cash flow and cash flow generation regarding those black [ph]. Like for example, if signings result from positive services growth, is there any impact of future cash flow as they start [ph] and how should we think about the cash flow with your sign-post or flag-post comment? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Jim. I think I heard it but you are -- you must be on mobile, so it was little bit hard to hear it. But I think the question was is there a correlation between planting the flag on some of the revenue trajectories and cash flow. So broadly speaking, the answer is obviously yes but it's kind of at the margin if you will. So as we turn our GPS business and we start to bring on all these new clients that we have and put them on the IBM cloud, of course, we expand the capacity of the cloud but that's already in our plans, right. So at the relationship level, everything that has to do with driving revenue is going to have an impact with cash but the way we have planned and talked about our cash flow all year has been flat year-to-year, we've recognized already that we're driving capacity into the cloud that we have to build the capacity in the scale we need and so it doesn't have an impact into the way we've guided it but obviously there is a correlation between what kind of growth we get and the cash demands if you will of the business but not different from what we've talked about all year.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Jim. Let's take one more question please.
Operator
Our last question is from Meena [ph] with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, thanks. If you look historically at sort of the make up of the different quarters for the full, the last six years you generated roughly about 23.5% of your earnings for the full year in the third quarter. Is that based on your comments about the mainframe and the fourth quarter; is that still the right way to think about the third quarter and then you get the bulk of the benefit from the mainframe really driving the fourth quarter earnings profit?
Martin Schroeter
Well, again, I think we talked a bit about the EPS Q [ph] and we talked where I think we're going to land. But as we said for the third -- but as I said, in the fourth is where we see most of the growth begin because the mainframe in the fourth is where the bulk of it is going to sit. So you do the SKU math in terms of percentage in the third but yes, the answer is yes, we're going to see the bulk of the growth from the mainframe in the full quarter mainframe in the fourth, as well as the services signings that will have a full quarter impact. And then obviously as we go through time and we talked a bit about this on the prepared remarks and you've seen some of our announcements about for instance the cognitive delivery platform that we're building; those build as you go through time as well, and so all of that will have more of an impact in the fourth quarter.
So just to wrap up, again, quickly; we finished the first half kind of spot-on where we said we would, we've positioned ourselves now to have the second half, that we're confident we'll deliver. The path from here though as we said is pretty -- at a high level, it's an improved revenue trajectory, it's an improved GP margin trajectory, and it's an improved expense trajectory and we have now I think in the second quarter shown that the GP margin trajectory is there; we've obviously got the ability and we've showed good expense management and disciplined investments. And then on the revenue we've going to go through it piece by piece to talk about where we planted the flag and the most recent again, second quarter we'll plant the flag on GTS, so we'll drive an improved revenue trajectory.
So thank you for joining the call. We look forward to talking to you in 90 days.

Thanks, Patricia. In the first quarter, we delivered over $18 billion of revenue, operating pretax income of $2.1 billion and operating earnings per share of $2.38, which is up year to year. This is in line with the view we provided back in January and keeps us on track to our full year expectations for earnings per share and free cash flow.
In the first quarter, we continued to deliver strong performance in our strategic imperative with revenue up 13% at constant currency. As is typical, I'll focus on constant currency growth rates throughout. Our Cloud offerings were up 35% this quarter; led by cloud as a service, which was up over 60%; Analytic, the largest of our strategic areas, was up 7%; Mobile was up over 20%; and Security up 10%. We also continued to deliver core capabilities to our clients running mission critical systems and processes. Many of these products provide the foundation of hybrid environments, enabling our clients to get more value from there on premise data and applications. Some of these key franchises are growing like WebSphere, while others are declining as they are in declining markets. But all are high value.
We’ve been very clear that to be successful with enterprise clients and to solve real problems, you need to bring together cognitive solutions on cloud platforms and create industry specific solutions. And so we’ve been focused on building a cognitive and cloud platform, and massing the best industry skills and capabilities, all while maintaining our focus on delivering higher value solutions.
As part of the transformation, we’ve made significant investments and shifted resources. This level of investment and a longer return profile of the cloud of the service businesses are reflected in our margins. Our foundation is now solidly in place. And while the investments will continue, our focus shifts to improving the returns on these investments by building scale and realizing operating efficiencies, keeping us on track to our full year objectives. And so our first quarter results once again reflect the success we’re having in our strategic imperatives. We grew 13% in the quarter, which was compared to our strongest growth quarter last year. Over the last 12 months, our strategic imperatives together generated nearly $34 billion in revenue and now represent 42% of our total revenue.
With over $14.5 billion in cloud revenue over the last 12 months, we’re the global leader in enterprise cloud. We play an important role in running the critical processes of the largest enterprises. And so it's not surprising that each of the 10 largest global banks, nine of the top 10 retailers and eight of the top 10 airlines, are now IBM cloud as-a-service customers.
At our investor briefing last month, we spent the day showing how we’ve transformed IBM into a cognitive solutions and cloud platform Company, and the importance and value of delivering industry specific solution. We talked about the differentiation of our cognitive and cloud platform through specific Watson technologies, through our data first approach and our enterprise strength cloud. We bring all of this together in one-architecture and we’re providing highly differentiated solutions by-industry and scaling these solutions. I am not going to recap all of that here, but what I want to focus on today is some of the progress we made specifically in the first quarter with our solutions, our clients and our partners.
In the quarter, we expanded the reach of Watson and the IBM Cloud through our partnership with Visa, where Watson IoT turns cars, appliances and other connected devices into potential points to sale. Through our alliance with Samsung, where the weather company will be the default weather app on new Samsung devices, powering the weather experience for tens of millions of devices by the end of the year. And through our engagement with H&R Block, where we're now embedded in 10,000 branches, enabling 9 million filers to benefit from the Watson enhanced expertise of H&R Block’s tax professionals.
In the first quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Salesforce to deliver joint solutions, design to leverage artificial intelligence and enable companies to make smarter, faster decision across sales, service and marketing. We also partnered with Wanda, one of the largest commercial and enterprise groups in Asia to bring public cloud services to China. We're building emerging technologies on the IBM Cloud like Blockchain and Quantum.
In Blockchain, we had over 40 new engagements in the quarter and are working on over 400 more. And as we’ve discussed in the past, the opportunities spend multiple industries. This quarter, we announced we're working with Maerks to use Blockchain to transform the global shipping supply chain; partnered with Northern Trust to launch Blockchain for the private equity market; and are collaborating with the FDA to explore how a Blockchain can benefit public health.
In the first quarter, we also announced the first commercial Quantum system. IBM 2 systems are designed to tackle problems that are beyond the reach of today's computing system. These are just a few of the examples of the reach and scale we're building with cognitive and cloud, and I'll highlight a few more in the segment discussions. But first, I'll walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.
Our revenue for the quarter was $18.2 billion, which is down 2%. Currency was once again a headwind to growth, fairly consistent with the impact in the fourth quarter. At current spot rates that headwind will be more substantial over the next couple of quarters. On a geographic basis, last quarter I talked about the impact the macro and geo-political trends on some countries’ performance. In Europe, much of this continued into the first quarter with the clients in the UK and Germany, in particular, putting pressure on our growth.
Our gross margin performance continues to reflect investments across our business and the mix to as service businesses. I'll talk about additional drivers in the segment discussions. Looking at our expense, pre-tax profit tax rate and cash flow metrics, a year-to-year dynamics, reflect some unique items in last year's first quarter result. A year ago, we had charges that impacted our expense and pre-tax income by nearly $1.5 billion, including a work force rebalancing charge of $1 billion.
In the first quarter of this year, our work force rebalancing charge was about $170 million, so the year-to-year impact of a lower level of workforce rebalancing accounts for 11 point of the 20% reduction in total expense. Our expense also includes a higher level of IP income, reflecting the success we've had in rebuilding our intellectual property income base through IP partnerships. I'll come back to this a little later. And so our operating pre-tax profit of $2.1 billion was up over 50% this quarter.
Our tax rate for the quarter reflect an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15%, in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year of 15% plus or minus 3 points. We also said, we've had a discreet tax benefit in the first quarter of $400 million to $500 million, and in the quarter, the net benefit was just under $500 million. This is far less than in discreet benefit we had last year of $1.2 billion associated with the Japan tax refund. And so tax was the substantial headwind to our net income and EPS growth in the quarter.
We generated $2.3 billion of operating net income in the quarter and net income margin of 12.4%, which is up 30 basis points. On the bottom line, our operating EPS was up 1% to $2.38. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is down year-to-year by the amount of last year's Japan tax refund. As you know, there is a lot of seasonality in the timing of our cash flows, much more so than in our net income. That’s why it makes sense to look at cash realization on a trailing 12-month basis. Over the last 12 month, our free cash flow was 90% of our GAAP net income.
Looking at our segments, Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 3% year-to-year and pre-tax income was up double digits. Our solution software revenue was up 5% while transaction processing software was down 1%. Within solution software, growth was again led by offerings in analytics, including our Watson related offerings and Security. We saw strong SaaS performance with strong double digit growth again this quarter.
I’ll share more on our progress starting with Analytics. We saw good growth in on premise data basis and data warehousing, which includes DB2, Informix and Netezza. Content and integration offerings were also up this quarter as data ingestion as an important initial step in a cognitive journey. As part of that journey, our Watson platform continues to gain momentum in the marketplace.
The Watson platform, built on the IBM Cloud, underpins our AI strategy and is a fast and easy way to embed cognitive into our clients’ work flows. Two great examples are Salesforce H&R Block. H&R Block went from an idea to fundamentally changing the client engagement experience with Watson, redesigning business processes and deploying a cognitive solution across 10,000 branches in just a matter of months.
Building on the platform, we’ve differentiated with industry expertise across verticals. In Watson Health, we had strong growth, particularly in oncology, government and life sciences, as we move to scaling Watson and healthcare. Out of the top 25 life sciences companies, nearly half are either using or implementing our cognitive offerings. In an environment of increased regulatory pressure, Cognitive helps to expedite the time to bring drugs to market and to monitor them, once in the market.
This quarter, we also introduced new cognitive offerings, such as Watson Imagining Clinical Review and infuse Cognitive into existing offering. For example, in Watson Care Manager, we’re bringing organic and acquired content together to build the cloud based offering that addresses integrated care; we’re then adding cognitive capabilities to extract trends and provide actionable insights. This is the kind of work we can do with our industry specific development skills.
We also had good growth in Watson IoT where we added over 50 new clients to our IoT platform again this quarter. And we’re incorporating new capabilities into the IoT platform, such as the visa payment services mentioned earlier. Clients are collocating for innovation at our Munich center, and the number of developers on our IoT platform had strong double digit growth.
Watson for Financial Services also contributed to growth this quarter. Here, we’re leveraging the skills we acquired through the acquisition of Promontory, the world’s leading regulatory compliance consulting firm, to develop cognitive offerings in areas like regulatory change management. It is a space ideally suited for cognitive because its expertise and domain driven; banks aren’t going to automate core regulatory processes with publicly available data alone. By combining industry experts with cognitive capabilities and levering industry specific client data, we’re building solutions that solve the problems in the industry. Remember, it matters who change your AI platform on what data and who owns the insights. By pulling all of this together, IBM will be well positioned as the leader in the reg tech marketplace.
Security also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven again by areas such as data security and security intelligence. We’ve had strong traction in Watson for Cyber Security since launching in February, and deployed it in over 50 customers globally. And we embedded Cognitive into another offering, MaaS360 Advisor, using machine learning to analyze and protect devices. We complement our software offerings with security services to offer the broadest portfolio in the industry. Together with our security services, we outpace the market.
Turning to transaction processing software, performance improved sequentially driven by Z Systems Middleware and Storage Middleware. While the overall business is declining, we have some areas that are growing, like software-defined-storage; other parts are high value and running mission critical workloads for our clients but the growth profile is stable-to-declining.
Turning to profit, Cognitive Solutions’ gross margin is down, driven by continued investment into strategic areas, including acquisitions and the mix toward SaaS. Roughly a quarter of the Cognitive Solutions business is now services and SaaS offerings, which currently have a different margin profile. Pre-tax income is up for the segment and improving year-to-year even when you adjust for the lower rebalancing charges. This segment has very high PTI margins, which expanded this quarter. So for the Cognitive Solutions segment, we grew revenue and profit in the quarter. We’re embedding Cognitive into more offerings, scaling platforms and building high value vertical solutions.
Global Business Services was down 2%, which is a two point improvement in the trajectory from last quarter. Strategic Imperatives grew double-digits, led by our cloud and mobile practices. Overall, we had modest growth in signings this quarter, driven by our digital offerings. However, the GBS backlog is still declining. As we talked about last quarter, we need the growth from our new offerings to drive consistent signings growth to improve the trajectory of the GBS backlog.
Consulting revenue was down 2%, improving nearly 3 points from last quarter performance. We have good growth in IBM iX, our digital design practice that helps our clients build new customer and employee engagement models around digital. We've built a robust network of 35 design studios around the world where clients co-create with GBS consultants in digital strategy, design and mobile experience.
We’re redesigning our clients’ work flows through integrated solutions and a robust set of enterprise grade mobility applications. This quarter, we announced agreements with BP Castrol, Bell Canada and Santander to name a few. In Consulting, we continue to shift resources to our Cognitive Services, Advanced Analytics and Digital Platform, and away from the more traditional areas, including consulting for on premise enterprise applications and some migration and process reengineering services. Our consulting revenue reflects this shift. Application management was flat year-to-year and has been relatively stable over the last year. We're innovating our clients’ platforms helping them migrate to new cloud architectures increasing their speed and agility, and ultimately, improving their competitiveness.
Turning to profit, we continue to invest in our strategic imperatives and build-out our practices around cognitive, cloud, mobile and digital design. Over the last year, we've added nearly 8,000 resources to these businesses. There also continue to be accounts where we are investing more to deliver on important client commitment. And in parallel, we're streamlining the practice infrastructure and driving efficiencies in our delivery model through new methods, solutions and project management approaches.
As we talked about at our investor briefing, GBS is aligned and focused its capabilities around three growth platforms. The first is digital strategy and iX, where we help clients to imagine what their businesses should look like in the digital world and then execute a roadmap to build and migrate their capabilities to get them there. The second is cognitive process transformation where we help clients adapt their core processes and integrate cognitive technology to gain insight, drive efficiencies and create new business model. The third is cloud application innovation where we modernize our systems by putting in place new cloud centric application architectures tailored to their business and their industry.
With deep industry capabilities we're executing a strategy that is client value led and powered by IBM assets and leading third party platforms. We're refocused our practice model to ensure we're building deep skills in the right areas and increasing our sales and delivery capacity. We're starting to see the benefit of this focus and are expecting improved performance over the course of the year.
Technology services and cloud platforms revenue was down 2%. We continue to have strong double digit growth in our strategic imperatives particularly in cloud which was up over 40% as we build out hybrid cloud environment for our client. As enterprises move to the cloud, they need help in managing the complexity of integrating multiple environments. We're able to move these enterprises to the cloud in a way that leverages their critical data and IT investment. Our cloud as a service revenue for the segment grew over 50% and our annual as-a-Service run rate was $5.7 billion.
Infrastructure services was down 2%, as you know this is a business model where we drive productivity for our clients. We orchestrate disparate systems and optimize IT operations. We help clients manage their hybrid cloud environment which can include multiple cloud platforms, on premise data centers and mobile environment.
When we deliver this productivity to our clients that's less revenue for us, but then we look to create new revenue streams by moving them to new areas, acquiring new scope and bringing on new clients. So our business model has always been to deliver productivity for our clients and then grow by expanding our scope of work and adding new clients to the platform.
While we had some substantial relationships lined up we did not get them closed by quarter end which impacted revenue in the period. The revenue trajectory also reflects that a couple of large clients brought their operations in house due to regulatory and other unique circumstances. These clients remain on IBM platforms and will continue to be a trusted partner.
Turning to technical support services revenue was down 2%. We continue to ship more to our multivendor support services which again grew this quarter. We provide end-to-end support both inside and outside the data center including for example IoT environment. Integration software was down 3%. We grew in our hybrid integration software that connects and integrates applications, data and processes across on premise and cloud environment.
In addition Webster application server grew for the third consecutive quarter, demonstrating the importance of middleware in public, private and hybrid environment. We declined in our on-prem dev ops tools and IP services management software. While some clients prefer to keep this work in house these kinds of workloads continue to shift to cloud, we're seeing this as Blumix, our cloud dev ops platform continues to expand.
Looking at profit, gross profit margin was down while PTI margin for the segment was up 5 points year-to-year. This quarter we had a lower level of work force rebalancing and we recognized savings from productivity actions including last year's transformation actions.
Much of this was reinvested in new and existing skills. We are investing as we move to a Watson based cognitive delivery model. Through this delivery model we're able to manage complex hybrid cloud environment and provide more insights into infrastructure that is always on, available everywhere and of course secure.
In infrastructure services we're constantly managing resources and investment across our portfolio and the combination of the winding down of some contracts, signings delays and some investment ahead of those signings impacted our profit in the quarter. Finally, in TSF, we're shifting more to multi-vendor services and in Integration Software we are mixing more to SaaS, which impacts margins in the near-term.
In summary, when you look at our performance in technology services and cloud platforms, our clients need help moving to the cloud and managing the complexity of their hybrid cloud environment and we continue to see strong growth in cloud and our as-a-Service revenue. Our middleware also continues to be important in this environment. Our business model is one were we're constantly delivering productivity for our clients, this is what make us the market leader. The profit cycle requires that we invest ahead to provide the scale and efficiency that our clients cannot achieved on their own. These dynamics impacted revenue and margin this quarter.
As we sign the contracts that didn’t close in March and yields of operational efficiencies we’re expecting better performance in this business in the second half. Our systems revenue reflects declines in z Systems and Power indicative of where we are in the product cycles, while storage grew after repositioning for flash across our portfolio. Systems gross margin was down year-to-year with declines across z Systems, Power and Storage as we address market shifts and product transition.
In z Systems, the mainframe continues to deliver a high value secure and scalable platform that is critical to our client's needs, addressing both existing and new workload. We added seven new clients in the quarter and 87 since the beginning of this cycle. We also had five major financial services sector win this quarter with existing clients, as well as several blockchain engagements. Our revenue and margin performance for the quarter reflects the fact we have nine quarters into the product cycle and we expect the new mainframe late in the year.
Power decline, which reflects our change over to a growing Linux market, while continuing to serve a high value, but decline in UNIX market. Linux workload again had double-digit growth, outpacing the market. We're the underdog here and we have a 3% share, so there is a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Our expanded Linux offerings, Power on Linux are going to pass the double revenue this year and HANA on Power continues to play an important role in that success, by contrast in UNIX, declines were driven by our midrange in low-end systems.
Power while critical for cloud and cognitive workloads continues to be impacted by shifting our platform from UNIX to Linux, both in revenue and margins. Storage hardware was up 7% this quarter, led by double-digit growth in our all-flash array offering. Flash contributed to our storage revenue growth in both midrange and high-end. In storage, we continue to see the shift in value towards software defined environment, where we continue to lead the market. We again had double-digit revenue growth and software defined storage, which is not reported in our system segment. Storage software now represents more than 40% of our total storage revenue. Storage gross margins are down as hardware continues to be impacted by pricing pressure.
To summarize Systems, our revenue and gross profit performance were driven by expected cycle declines in z Systems and Power mitigated by Storage revenue growth. We continue to expand our footprint and add new capabilities, which address changing workloads. What we’re facing some shifting market dynamics and ongoing product transitions, our portfolio remained uniquely optimized for cognitive and cloud computing.
New systems product introductions later in the year, will drive improved second half performance as compared to the first. I want to spend a minute on our IP income and put our recent performance into context. Our investment and research and development generates a significant amount of intellectual property and we have a number of different ways we monetize it. Keep in mind that the vast majority of our IP is monetized to revenue stream, with only a small portion through IP income.
15 years ago or so much of our IP was associated with our semi-conductor manufacturing and design business. At the time, in addition to licensing some of the IP, we used joint development agreements to deal with the economics of our manufacturing scale. These partners essentially helped that scale issue.
Since then our strategy has changed which resulted in a different mix of business. We continue to have joint development and technology licensing agreements though fewer. Now clients see the value in our IP, but it requires continues innovation to stay in high value spaces. And so more recently we are forming IP partnerships to enable ongoing innovation in our IP while allocating our development resources to where we see the best opportunities for us.
In these partnerships, we license, not sell, our source go to a technology or services partner who assumes the development mission and invests to innovate and build new functionality, enhancing the value of the asset, which reinforces and support to our revenue stream. We retain the ownership of the IP and the revenue streams and pay a royalty to the partner for the development mission. And as the partner sells to their clients they pay a royalty back to IBM from the revenue they receive. The benefits of these IP partnerships to us include the prioritization of our development resources, the continued innovation for our clients based on our high value assets and the creation of additional channels which can expand the clients base.
So to sum it up, our ability to monetize IP, is driven by the amount of IP that we create, which is substantial, not whether a transaction occurs in a particular period. Because our IP is high value and relevant to our clients it is attractive to a broad range of technology and services partners who can build solutions around the core assets. We had three new IP partnership agreements in the first quarter and now 19 over the last two years.
To put that in perspective we have licensed, on a non-exclusive basis about 1% of our software code base and these agreements to date and we are generating more IP every year than we are licensing, so we have a lot of opportunity in this area alone. But as I said earlier, why and how we chose to monetize our IP, for example, whether it to address scale issues or resource optimization, reflects our business strategy and so the opportunities and the model will evolve.
We are now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated $1.9 billion of cash from operations excluding our financing receivables and we invested over $800 million in capital expenditures particularly in our Watson and cloud platform areas as well as in support of our services and systems businesses and so our free cash flow was $1.1 billion.
Over the last year our cash utilization rate is 90%. Excluding the benefit of last year's tax refund free cash flow is flat year-to-year, and within that working capital contributed to our cash flow performance driven by strong cash collections. Our first quarter of free cash flow generation is in line with historical trends and we remain on track to deliver a level of free cash flow consistent with last year. Looking at uses of cash in the quarter we returned over $2.6 billion to our shareholders about half through dividends and half through share re-purchases. We bought back over 7 million shares and at the end of the first quarter we had 3.8 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
On the balance sheet we ended the quarter with $10.7 billion in cash and total debt of $42.8 billion. Two thirds of our debt was in support of our financing business which now includes the increase in leverage related to our client and commercial financing business IBM credit. The leverage in this business is now 9:2, which as I described in January translates to an increase of just over 600 million in global financing debt. 
The credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 52% investment grade, which is flat versus December and a point better than year ago. More information on our financing business is provided in the supplemental charts in the back up. Our non-financing debt was 14.3 billion with a debt to cap ratio of 48%, which is a point lower than December. Debt to cap is down 14 points year-to-year as you will recall that we frontend loaded our debt issuances this last year. Our balance sheet continues to have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long-term.
Let me wrap up by talking about how we see the balance of the year, starting with the progression on the first half and then drivers of our second half performance. As you know we typically see a profit improvement from first to second quarter. Last year the sequential improvement was significant because of the charges in the first quarter. Adjusting for these outside charges, we increased our operating pretax profit by an average of 800 million from first to second over the last couple of years. We see a similar level of sequential improvement this year, which means we would finish the first half at about 37% of our full year at least operating EPS expectation.
Now every year is different and we when you look at that 37% attainment compared to history, you will see it's a few points below the last few years. So I'll spend a minute on why this year the first to second half dynamics will be different, and why we remained comfortable with our full year expectation. To do that I'll give you a couple of examples of things that we know and things that we expect. We know that will have new system product later in the year and this will drive a significant improvement in gross profit from first half to second half. Related to that in the second half we'll have the investment ramp behind us, so we'll also benefit from lower systems development spending in the second half relative to the first. 
We also know that we'll wrap on last year's larger acquisitions, there will be less dilutive to profit in the second half as we continue to ramp revenue and realize some operational synergies. Then there are a couple of things that we expect, particularly in our services businesses. We expect that global technology services will sign a few of the larger contracts that didn’t close in the first quarter and that together with the cost savings and the yield on some of the investments we've been making will improve the first to second half profit dynamics. In global business services our trajectory is starting to improve and we expect this to continue throughout the year, we also expect currency to be a headwind and we put a view of that into the supplemental slides.
The translation of our pretax profit to net income will depend on the mix of business and the operational tax rate assumption continues to be 15% plus or minus 3 points. As always this is without discreet items. To put all that together, and we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017 and free cash flow net consistent with last year. 
And with that we'll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed with your question.
Wamsi Mohan
Martin, as we look at this quarter on a year-on-year basis we saw PTI dollar improvement of close to about $700 million, should we expect any more PTI improvement over the course of this year, given that the discrete tax benefit was 500 million, you can pretty much guess your guidance from those two elements, not sure if there is more discreet items yet to come, but conceptually is there are more PTI benefit yet to come or have you seen the PTI benefit already flow through? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, thanks Wamsi. The first thing I’ll say is I apologies for my voice, so if I sound kind of crocking -- I got a bit of a cold here. But hopefully you can understand. So with regard to what we see from here out, as you noted we got about 700 in our guidance on a full year basis, we did about 700 in the first, the thing I would add is that we don’t know what that mix is going to be, it's 15 plus or minus two points. So if you were to take that range, we either have another couple hundred to go if it comes in from a high tax area or we're already over solved by few hundred. So either way, you are in about that right range.
Now we have a lot of work underway to drive productivity in our services business, we talked a bit about that in the prepared remarks, we still expect to get the growth out of the acquisitions that we spend some money on. So there is a lot more obviously within the dynamics of our business from here to the end of the year. But if you just wanted to look at those two line items, then yes either we have a little bit left to go, if it comes in at a higher tax mix, so we've over solved already, but yes that’s the -- what the guidance implied.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty
At the Analyst Day, you talked about as you scale the cloud business, as you scale the cognitive initiative that we should start to expect margin stability and even inflection. You also talked -- essentially guided to GBS margin improvement for the full year. And when you step back and look at gross margins which is more of the clean read on your profitability not into the insight work pressure [ph] balancing and IP income, those declines accelerated this quarter in all of those businesses. So the question is, do you still expect that we can start to see stability and even inflection in any of those businesses this year or is that further out?
Martin Schroeter
So couple of things, when we look at -- we pretty much look at every year, one quarter is the low point in GP margin that always true. And then we build sequentially from there, I think what I would expect this year in that build sequentially, I do expect as we said in prepared remarks, I do expect the services units to start to drive sequential improvement in that business.
Now some have longer to go, more progress to make if you will, as we noted GBS with the declining revenue and the impact of margins, we also -- we believe that a business that can grow, pass the growth is what we described, which is consistent signings growth, we will get the backlog growth which will drive revenue growth. So all of that we still think we have ahead of us, we did get signing growth in the first quarter, it's 2%, but we got signing growth and so we will continue to build that business back.
And then in GBS specifically, the margins in the new strategic imperative work, the margins in the areas that that business is moving to remain better than the margins in the places they're coming from. So yes, we have to realize the productivity at the overall model level, but we are seeing margin opportunities in those new areas in GBS and we would expect to continue to make progress, but again in total the margin picture on a sequential basis as we always do will grow from first to second, third and fourth as well, and depending on the mix of business that growth that we typically see from first to fourth, could be three, four points higher and it's been as high as 10 points in some years. We'll be within that range some place by the time we get out of the fourth, but the first quarter is always the low point in the year.
Operator
Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steve Milunovich
Martin, you talked about the investments that the company has been making the last few years and previously suggested a little more flexibility this year, could you talk about in dollars, are the investments that you're making into the strategic imperatives flattening out? Should we look for less growth year-over-year in those investments, are they actually becoming flat and is there a point in the next couple of years where we could even see them decline year-over-year to help your margins?
Martin Schroeter
So, couple of things, one, when we said we would expect -- when the tip of the bow of the ship gets through the wave, that was a year-to-year statement, and so now with those acquisitions for instance in our run rate, the dollar level is at an elevated amount and so the year-on-year impact is diminished if you will. Now, all of those businesses need continued investment and for IBM, what it's always been about for us is shift as much as it is adding to that pie. So I think the adding to the pie now is behind us, if you will, and the shift will continue. So we'll continue to invest heavily in the strategic imperative, but it won't represent the same growth that what we've -- as what we've seen in the past now that they're in our model.

Thank you. Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Toni Sacconaghi
I just wanted to confirm and clarify how you're getting to your full year '13 AB [ph] target. So for Q2, I think given that you expect 37% of EPS in the first half that would point to EPS of about $2.73, I think consensus is $3.17. So well below Street expectations. Which means that you have to be well above Street expectation for the second half. I'm wondering if you can also clarify what you're assuming on IP licensing for the year. It was up dramatically in the first quarter, I think you said it would be about flat year-over-year. So that implies the rest of the year IP licensing is going to be declining and therefore a year-over-year headwind, is that the right way we should think about it, and if you're IP licensing or your discrete tax benefits are significantly higher than you think today, will you be adjusting your guidance accordingly?
Martin Schroeter
So, a couple of things Toni, one we're not adjusting our guidance, we've reaffirmed that we see an at least $13.80 number for the year, and we also see free cash flow flat, roughly flat as we said. So same guidance as we talked about in January and quite frankly from my perspective the quarter played out you know pretty much as we expected, other than we thought we had a couple of more signings relationships in services that we could have gotten done, but by and large the quarter played out as we expected and we maintained our guidance.
In the prepared remarks Tony, we started to put together some of the things that we know and some of the things that we expect and I think that framework is kind of how I think about it. Now as you know we have a lot of scenarios around guidance and what might happen, but let's go through a couple of the things that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. First, you know the systems product announcements have kind of a double impact.
One you have to ramp investment ahead of the revenue in order to get that system ready. That's the period we're in now and we'll be in it through the first half. Once we get the systems announced and out the door then we start getting revenue and you get the double benefit you get GP dollars and you get lower spending in order to because you don't have to ramp any more. So that has a pretty profound impact on the first to second half.
We also talked about getting the acquisitions further embedded. Now we do a lot of acquisitions, there's obviously opportunities to drive investment in those but we also have a lot of opportunity to realize efficiencies in how we run. So we see an improvement from first to second half -- continued improvement first to second half as we ramp those new solutions around those acquisitions as well as get some synergies from the way we run the play.
In our services business as we mentioned we see an improvement as we go through the year, both in the revenue trajectory and in the margin profile quite frankly. We got a lot of work to drive productivity in our services business both in GTS and GBS and it sits kind of across that delivery platform we think there is a lot of opportunity to drive improvement as we get into the second half and then IP income, similar to how we described it in January, we said we have a bunch of scenarios around IP income, we see enough opportunity to be flat year-to-year, but our guidance didn't rely on it year to year.
So to your point, if we're flat versus excuse me -- here's where my voice starts to go Tony, I apologize. If we're flat relative to -- for the full year and we're up a bit in the first quarter, does that imply down? Yes that's kind of how we expected the year to play out. And in fact we said that, based on what you describe, it could be a bigger headwind the what you described, because not a lot of our scenarios have flat, some of them -- we had a -- like I said quite a good year in the second half -- quite a good second half of last year in IP income and so that could be down a bit, but again we've got a lot of scenario.
So the year comes together I think because we do have dramatically different profile in the second versus the first. We included the framing, if you will, of where we finish the first half because not every year plays out the same way and I think it’s important to understand the dynamics. But no change to our guidance and we still see the year playing out as we did in the first quarter.

Thank you, next question is from Ingin Wang with JPMorgan, your line is open.
Ingin Wang
Just one on the tech services side, it sounds like some delays in deals closing. Is that a macro-cyclical issue in terms of maybe a slow start to the year for some of your enterprise clients? What's the visibility into these deals closing in GPS and also the improvement in GBS that you just mentioned, is that also required improvement in macro environment, or is there something else that's driving that [Multiple Speakers]?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. So thanks, Ingin. These no macro, so I’ll talk about GBS specifically. And quite well, the nature of the work we do with our clients, we are running the hearts and lungs of our client's businesses. And so obviously, when you run hearts and lungs, you’re not running toward 90-day schedule. There is nobody by the way that’s in the room with you other than the client, nobody has the breadth of the capability that we have.
So our clients move at a pace that reflect the important of the work we do. And at the same time add into that the steps required for instance regulatory approval, we’ve got a lot of [technical difficulty] customers, there are a lot of customers in regulated industry. And so the signings delays were not at all macro driven, this is our -- these are deep, deep partnerships with our clients that require careful planning, careful execution and they’re not going to move on a 90-day cycle.
In GBS, again, I don’t think, we need an improved macro environment for GBS. In fact, one could argue that GBS will do better when clients are more focused on how to move to the future and more focused on or put under more pressure, if you will. The transformation that GBS is going through is driven by their ability to rescale in the new areas and we put -- we've poured a lot of people into GBS focused on these new practices that we have. The results that we see as the teams move into those new practices are very positive.
So no, this is not at all macro, on GBS it is again, because the relationships with these clients are so vital to how their organizations run and are never going to move on a 90-day calendar. And GBS I think is demonstrating now that as it moves into the future, it can do even better.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Jim Schneider
Just wanted to follow-up on the earlier services question and maybe ask about the commentary you made about couple of clients, order clients taking work in-house. Is that a commentary on the infrastructure and cloud piece of the business specifically, or is that a broader comment on the application services and like? And can we maybe just kind of talk about what you seeing terms of pricing pressure in the market, because you previously called that out several times, but didn’t this time? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, sure. So there is -- I wouldn’t say there is anything macro. In the two instances that we mentioned about people bringing -- companies bringing this in-house, very unique circumstances. And I think when I describe it, which I will, I think you will agree that they are sort of unique. So for instance, we have a client in Germany, it was renewed -- it was a five-year deal renewed for another five years and there is a rule, there is a law in Germany that this particular type of client cannot renew the same contract twice, just can't. And so they had to bring it back in-house due to regulatory reason.
We will still -- they took the people, by the way, they were all in structure that allowed them to take the people back. They still run their IBM mainframes. So we’re still partners with them on the infrastructure that they run. But that’s a highly unique, I am not making on macro statement. And in the other case, again highly unique to the client situation, they had a plan in their industry to split two businesses and so they were heading down the path of having two businesses with two infrastructures. We have them by the way, both of them and then the market if you will, they made a judgment based on the market that they were just going to take one of those businesses and sort of wind it down. So they just had no need, if you will, to have a big infrastructure around that particular business. So very unique, not at all what I would call a macro.
And then on pricing pressure, the nature of these relationships, again, as I mentioned earlier, these are substantial relationships that are running very core of what these companies need. And if I had to -- I guess these are complex, but if I had to simplify it, they're asking us to move them into -- in the future to move into cloud, to give them the agility and the security and the mobility that they see their competitors have. So there is -- there are not -- there is nobody in the room with us when we go in for those calls. And if they want to purse that path and as I think there is -- that suits their business model, then they're talking to us and we'll make those deals happen, but it's not a macro statement, its very much about our ability to deliver the future to them and whether or not that suits the way they're thinking their business at that particular time.

Thank you, next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC. You may ask your question. 
Amit Daryanani
I guess Martin, I just want to go back to the gross margin discussion and perhaps more at the corporate level, I realize that these margins will improve from Q1 to Q4. At what point I guess do you see gross margin starting to stabilize, the year-over-year declines start to abate for the company? And if you were to think about the cost saving benefits, what cost saving benefits that you have expected for 2017?
Martin Schroeter
Sure Amit, a couple of things. One, we are seeing the savings if you will of what we were able to start to transform last year and the actions we took. Now remember at the time we talked about Q1 '16. So a year ago we talked about how there was some -- some measure of that was to reduce capacity and a lot of that, by the way, that capacity reduction was to get our teams back together into collocated offices, where they could operate in more agile environment and it was to reduce the number of sites, if you will, which we had people and couldn’t collaborate properly.
So there were some measure with the reduced capacity, but the bulk of what we wanted to do is to revitalize skills, as we always do. We're always revitalizing our skills. So we see the benefit of that in the new skill mix that we have, we see the benefit of that for instance in GBS growing signings in the first quarter.
Now there is productivity that we see in the SG&A line, because while we are investing more for development our SG&A spending is down. And that was again not only the reduced capacity, but it's us being more efficient at how we operate. From a gross profit margin perspective, we are a high -- we have a high value model as you know. And so one of the things we are always looking at is, are the places we are going to still more valuable and higher margin than the places we are coming from and the strategic imperatives as we've talked about it in the past have a higher margin profile than the core if you will.
That shouldn’t surprise anyone, I think that’s why our investors expect us to invest into those new areas, as opposed to just going to chase some lower margin content. And we still see that now, it's been true since we have been talking about the strategic imperatives and it remains true that the margins in those areas continue to be higher. So I think that I still view the opportunity for us and gross margin is going to look -- gets better because again the places we're moving to is better than what we're coming from.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. You may ask your question. 
David Grossman 
Martin, if you look over the next 12 to 24 months I think the strategic imperative were in the low 40, the percentage of revenue. What are the main variables that dictate whether the imperative grow to over 50% of revenue and again to more than compensate for the decline in the legacy core.
Martin Schroeter
Sure David, so few things first and we talked about this a little bit in the prepared remarks and I think it's important, the legacy core is a business that we're confidently reinventing, it's not something that we are under investing, it's not something that we don’t like, we really like this business, it is very high value and some of that content sure fits in declining market. So it has declining opportunity, but that’s high value. And then, as we talked about in that prepared remarks, some of those businesses like Webster application server is growing, it's in a growing market and we grow.
So the core is -- and I know you didn’t say it this way, but the core is -- I just want to make sure everyone's clear, is made up of lot of different things. And included in that core, if you will, is -- we've got part of our power business, we got some of our mainframe business, we're just not in the time of the cycle for the core part -- for those parts of the core to grow. We will get to that part of the cycle when it grows. So then from the high-level math you did, we said that strategic imperatives would be 40%, we're obviously there, but 40 billion at least by 2018 and we're still on track to get there, in fact we're a little bit ahead of track.
Now when those two lines cross, I don’t know, I think that the investment community has been keen for us to stay on that solid double digit growth path and the strategic imperatives, there have been concerns every quarter about whether or not we're flowing down, but we just grew 13% on our toughest compare of the year last year because we did '17 in the first. So I think that the cross over point, I think is a mathematical exercise, what I'm looking that is, are the strategic imperatives and the growth we're getting out of those continuing to put us and keep us on the track to that 40 billion.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO. Your line is open.
Keith Bachman
I wanted to ask you, is pruning still on the table? What I mean by that is, if I think about the revenue growth the core actually decelerated this core compared to say the last three quarters. And if I look at some of the areas like GBS you have application maintenance that’s combined with BPO that’s over a 50% of the business and well under company profit levels. And I'm just trying to understand specifically focused on GBS, is how you improve revenue growth, but should you improve revenue growth or is there more pruning that you can do as it relates to the total IBM portfolio, but particularly within GBS.
Martin Schroeter
Sure Keith, so I think, I look at our portfolio and as you know we talked about this and we have been pretty clear that, we look at our portfolio through the eyes of value. And I think the portfolio, not solely through the eyes of growth, value and -- no value or a limited value without growth is obvious that we wouldn’t -- we would have a -- we would be thinking about whether or not that fits. But the portfolio we have today, I view as high value.
The AMS business as you pointed out, it's a high value business. Now the revenue is pretty stable, but it serves a really important need with our client base, it allows us based on how we do it with our industry focus, it allows us to drive value for our client. So I think of pruning is something you do when you don’t see an opportunity for differentiation, when you don’t see a longer term opportunity for value, and I look at the portfolio now and I think there is -- I think we have a very high value portfolio and I think that GBS, large GBS, all of it plays a critical rolled in that, I don’t see a pruning opportunity here.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.
Jim Suva
I think there is no question about the success in the strategic imperatives, how you are ramping those. The biggest question on many of the follow up calls, well maybe I'll give it one more shot, [indiscernible], the investment you are putting forth in the degradation to gross margins, when are we going to see them stabilized or do you have line of sight to that? It just seems like when you give up an invest, at some point, you want to progress the fruits of those efforts and it went out time and time again, so I’ll ask kind of one more time, do you see stabilization, and if so, when?
Martin Schroeter
Yes, sure Jim. So again -- and you know this is actually, it's an interesting question because -- it's an interesting timing of this question because I want to make sure that everybody understands that as we head now into the rest of this year and one of our focus item as it's always has been, but now the timing is right, is to get the returns for our investments. It's something if you were to pull 100 IBM executives, it's something that they would all say is, now it's time to get the returns.
So we have driven very heavy investments that has impacted our margins. But the investment is not the only opportunity, only lever we have to improve margins, we have a lot of opportunity in our services business and in our delivery model and how we drive margin. So yes it is time for us to get the returns we have invested quite heavily. The strategy is right, we hear it from our clients every day, the places that we are moving them to and the work we do in the core is highly, highly valuable to them. So I think now, the short hand in that is yes, now it's time.
And with that I’ll wrap up the call by saying, we have been making significant investments and now we've added, by the way, a ton of capabilities to the IBM company. We started new businesses, we made new markets, we've changed, as we always do, industries and professions and we'll continue to do that. But now it's with the business positioned very well for the long term, in terms of capabilities. Always opportunity to add a little bit here or there, but with the business positioned well for the long term, now it is time to focus on improving the returns on those investments. So thank you very much for joining the call today.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks Patricia. As is typical in January, I’ll start out with some top-level comments on the quarter and the year, discuss the details of the quarter, and then conclude with our view of 2017.
In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $21.8 billion, operating net income of $4.8 billion, and operating earnings per share of $5.01, which is up 3.5%. There are significant opportunities and shifts in our industry, and we believe that to be successful with enterprise clients, you need to bring together cognitive technologies on cloud platforms, that create industry-based solutions to solve real-world problems.
So with that very brief context around our point of view, let me comment on what we achieved in the full-year of 2016. We made progress in building new businesses and creating new markets and continued to deliver strong results in our strategic imperatives. We invested at a high-level, and remixed our skills to address these new opportunity areas. We also continued to innovate in the businesses that we have traditionally provided to our clients.
We returned capital to our shareholders and we achieved the earnings and free cash flow expectations we set last January, with $13.59 of operating earnings per share, and free cash flow of $11.6 billion, which is 97% of GAAP net income. So we did what we said we’d do, in a year not only with a lot of change in the industry, but also a year with a number of macro conditions and events, particularly in countries that are meaningful to our results. I’ll cover our expectations shortly, but right up front I’ll say that we are exiting 2016 in a stronger position than we entered it and that is reflected in our 2017 guidance.
Looking at some of the highlights of the fourth quarter, we had terrific growth in cloud, with revenue up 33%. We also had good growth in our analytics, security, and mobile solutions. We’re continuing to grow our substantial technology services business, reflecting the work our clients are demanding to help modernize and transform their infrastructures. And we had really good performance in our z Systems business, reflecting the value of differentiated, high-value solutions running important parts of our client’s infrastructure.
There were some macro challenges in the quarter in certain countries like Brazil, the UK and Germany, as well as the impact of a stronger dollar. As always my comments throughout will be based on constant currency. Our results for the quarter and the year reflect the success we’re having in our strategic areas, and the investments we’ve been making to drive that shift.
We delivered 14% revenue growth in our strategic imperatives for the year, led by cloud. We finished the year with $13.7 billion of cloud revenue, which was 17% of IBM’s revenues. Our strategic imperatives, together generated $33 billion of revenue in 2016, and now represent 41% of our revenue. To put this in perspective, when we first established the strategic imperatives, we said they’d grow to $40 billion, and represent over 40% of our revenue by 2018. The growth we achieved in 2016 keeps us ahead of track to the $40 billion. In fact, a growth rate of 10% to 11% from here gets us to the $40 billion in 2018.
We’re moving into a new phase. The debate about whether artificial intelligence is real is over, and we’re getting to work to solve real business problems. As we move into this new era, it’s important to understand what enterprise clients are looking for. They need a cognitive platform that turns vast amounts of data into insights, and allows them to use it for competitive advantage. They need access to a cloud platform not only for the capability, but for speed and agility. And they need a partner they trust, and who understands their industry work and process flows.
This is where we’re clear and confident about our point of view. Yes, we have world-class cognitive technology, but that’s table stakes. We are building datasets by industry that we either own, or we partner for. Importantly, we’ve designed Watson on the IBM Cloud to allow our clients to retain control of their data and their insights, rather than using client data to educate a central knowledge graph. And we’re using our tremendous industry expertise to build vertical solutions and train Watson on specific industry domains.
We are amassing these capabilities, because you need more than public data and automation algorithms to solve real problems like improving healthcare outcomes or navigating the banking regulatory environment. So in this new phase, data and the business model around data matters, industry matters and time matters and that’s why Watson is the AI platform for business.
Let me give you a couple of examples of the progress we made in 2016, bringing together cognitive, the IBM Cloud and our industry expertise. Watson Health provides cognitive insights on our enterprise-grade Watson Health Cloud, and leverages broad datasets that we own, including 100 million electronic health records, 200 million claims records, and 30 billion images. We now have 7,000 Watson Health employees, including doctors, nurses, health policy experts and 1,000 data scientists. We brought this together because you can’t change the way healthcare works, or work on curing cancer with public data alone. You need clinical data, payer data, images, all of which is private. You need the expertise of the leading oncologists and geneticists. And you need to do this work within a quality management system that is HIPAA-compliant.
So Watson Health was our first vertical. Late in the year, we launched Watson Financial Services, to provide targeted solutions, bringing together cloud, cognitive, industry and ecosystem capabilities. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Promontory, a leader in regulatory compliance and risk management consulting. We acquired Promontory because you can’t help banks navigate regulatory environments by scraping the web or automating keystrokes. You need top industry specialists that understand the complexity and can train Watson to deal with risk management requirements that are specific to financial services, because who trains your AI platform matters.
So bringing together cognitive technology, private data, a cloud platform and industry expertise is what you need to do real work in the enterprise. What is also becoming very clear is that as IT moves to the cloud and as business processes are delivered as digital services, it is essential they are enterprise-strength and that the transactions are trusted by all parties involved. That’s where the blockchain comes in. It’s a technology that brings together shared ledgers with smart contracts, to allow the transfer of any asset, whether a physical asset like a shipping container, a financial asset like a bond, or a digital asset like music, across any business network.
Blockchain increases transparency, auditability and trust. It reduces risk, and it can drive tremendous efficiencies. Bottom line, blockchain will help to fundamentally reengineer business processes and improve outcomes. We’re building a complete blockchain platform and we have already worked with over 300 clients to pioneer blockchain for business. Many are in financial services, to handle foreign exchange settlement, smart contracts, identity management and trade finance. Just last week, we announced securities clearing and settlement with DTCC.
But the application for blockchain is well beyond financial services. For example, we’re collaborating with Walmart to improve the way food is tracked, transported and sold to consumers across China, and with Everledger, who is using a cloud-based blockchain to track the provenance of diamonds and other high value goods as they move through the supply chain. Here too, the data needed to improve food safety or track diamonds isn’t on the web. It’s private data, owned by enterprises, who want to work with a partner they trust.
So in 2016 we built blockchain platforms and services, and in 2017 we expect to start scaling blockchain networks. I’ll touch on a few more examples in the segment discussions, but first I’ll walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.
Our revenue for the quarter was $21.8 billion, which is down 70 basis points. Over the course of the year, we’ve had growth in our annuity businesses, and some growth pressure in the transactional content. In the fourth quarter, even with a seasonally higher transactional content and a little less contribution from acquisitions, our constant currency revenue performance was similar to third quarter. With the strengthening of the dollar, currency returned to a headwind. In fact, with the change in rates since mid-October and the seasonal skew of our business toward the back end of the quarter, revenue was impacted by nearly $300 million.
On a geographic basis, we had sequential improvements in both the Americas and Asia Pacific, while EMEA decelerated. Performance by country would generally be what you’d expect, based on macro and geo-political trends. We’ve all read about various issues in countries such as the UK, Germany, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, and so our performance in these countries reflects that reality. Some of these countries, UK, Germany, and Brazil for instance, have a meaningful impact to our results. Collectively, these 3 countries had over a one point impact on our revenue performance in the quarter. Others, like Russia, Turkey and Egypt were also a drag on our growth, though less of an impact given their size.
We had really good results in China. In fact, China grew strong double-digits in the fourth, which resulted in revenue growth for the full year. This strength was in the banking sector, where our largest clients are upgrading to our latest technology to continue to run their infrastructure. I should mention that we also had good revenue performance in the U.S., where we returned to growth.
Our gross margin reflects the impact of our investments, including the acquisitions we’ve made, and the mix to as-a-Service businesses that aren’t yet at scale. Our expense overall is down 7% versus last year, and our expense-to-revenue ratio was down about a point and a half. This includes a 5 point year-to-year impact from the acquisitions we’ve closed over the last year, and a modest impact from currency.
Since early 2015, we’ve been talking about ramping the level of investment in the business in areas like cognitive and cloud. Our year-to-year expense dynamics reflect the fact that we’ve wrapped on that higher level of investment. We’re also seeing the yield from some of the workforce rebalancing actions earlier in the year. As we’ve discussed in the past, some of this is being reinvested in other areas, including cost.
Our expense dynamics also reflect the success we’ve had in rebuilding our intellectual property income base through IP partnerships. This is a model we’ve developed for some of our high value technologies that are more mature, but not necessarily in a priority investment area for us. So it made sense to work with partners who will invest and build businesses around some of these software assets. It’s good for them and it’s good for IBM.
We license the intellectual property to these partners, resulting in IP income for us. They take on the development mission, drive future innovation, and ultimately expand the client base as they take the product to market. As we generate revenue from our own sales, we pay our partner a royalty for the development mission they’ve assumed. As the partner expands their client base, they pay us a royalty because we retain ownership of the IP.
So with this model, we continue to own the product and our revenue stream, but shift our spending profile to a more variable cost structure, while extending the life of these assets. This is another way of monetizing our research and innovation, while allocating our resources to where we see our best opportunities. This quarter, our IP income reflects licenses for several software products and we have a pipeline that will continue into 2017.
Our pre-tax margin in the quarter was down 20 basis points. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing effective tax rate just under 16% for the year. This is in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year, of 18%, plus or minus a couple of points.
We generated $4.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter, which is up 1.5% and net income margin expanded by 60 basis points. With a share reduction of 2%, our EPS of $5.01 was better by 3.5%. We generated $4.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $11.6 billion for the year, which is 97% of our GAAP net income. We returned three-quarters of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
So summing up the metrics for the quarter, we had strength in our strategic areas with a growing annuity base, an improving expense trajectory, PTI margin that was essentially flat, and net margin that was up, modest growth in operating earnings per share, and free cash flow realization and shareholder return for the year that was in line with our longer-term model.
Moving to our segments, Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2%, and pre-tax income was up 1%. Our Solutions Software revenue was up, while Transaction Processing Software declined. Within Solutions Software, growth was again led by Analytics, including our Watson offerings such as Health, and Security. We continue to innovate the Watson Platform and extend cognitive across our solution offerings. We saw strong SaaS performance, with double-digit growth again this quarter. Our Cognitive Solutions margin profile reflects our continued investment into strategic areas, including acquisition content, and the ramp in our SaaS business.
Let me talk about the progress we’re making in parts of the portfolio. In Analytics, we are helping clients move data to the cloud and deliver actionable insights from the data with our cognitive capabilities. This quarter we introduced new offerings, like the Watson Data Platform, Watson Discovery Service and trade surveillance for Financial Services, spanning our core analytics platform, Watson platform, and industry platforms.
Our Watson platform, which underpins our cognitive strategy, continues to gain momentum in the marketplace. Natural language processing has long been at the core of Watson. Last quarter, we added new cognitive capabilities for conversation and the demand has been strong. We’ve seen significant growth in our API calls this year, especially around conversational services, where API calls increased 50 fold year to year.
Let me give you an example. In Latin America, Bradesco deployed a Portuguese solution based on Watson across more than 5,500 branches to assist employees in answering customers’ questions. Watson had already learned over 300,000 words in the Portuguese language, more than twice the number linguists say is necessary to be fluent. But this isn’t just about language translation – this is about understanding business. 
Watson was trained to answer questions on over 50 of Bradesco’s retail products. And since going live in October, Watson is now helping to answer nearly 9 out of every 10 questions every day. 
As I mentioned, we’re combining cloud and cognitive with industry expertise. In Watson Health, we are building scale and bringing real-world benefits to researchers and clinicians. With our offerings across five areas, including oncology and genomics, government, life sciences, value based care and imaging, Watson is helping over 45 million people globally.
Our oncology clients alone span more than 35 hospital systems. And with our acquisitions of Explorys, Phytel, Truven, and Merge, we have over 10,000 clients and partners. 
Genomics is another area where we’re building scale. We announced partnerships with both Quest Diagnostics and Illumina, where both companies will leverage IBM Watson for Genomics, a new service that integrates Watson’s cognitive services into genomic sequencing applications. Through partners, we will make Watson’s genomic analysis available to oncologists who treat 70% of cancer patients in the United States.
In the area of Life Sciences, Barrow Neurological Institute is an example of where we’re seeing real-world benefits today. Barrow reported using Watson for Drug Discovery to help identify five never-before linked genes associated with ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease. This work gives researchers new insights that will pave the way for the development of new drug targets and therapies to combat ALS. 
Without Watson, researchers predicted the discovery would have taken years, rather than only a few months. We had growth in our Watson IoT this quarter where our clients are putting the power of Watson to work across the immense data pool created by the Internet of Things. We launched new industry solutions targeting manufacturing and insurance and new collaborations with clients, like BMW. We more than doubled both the number of new clients and the number of developers on our IoT platform.
We also had good results from our Weather platform. Here too, we’ve demonstrated our tremendous scale this quarter. During Hurricane Matthew, our platform served as a critical resource for over 100 million people. Our platform delivered 350 million video streams over that week. Roughly 1.6 petabytes of data were delivered through a total of 141 billion API calls. With weather information, you have to be able to deliver that kind of scale, particularly when recognized as the most accurate forecaster.
Security also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven by areas such as data security and security intelligence. We announced a major expansion of our incident response capabilities, including the industry’s first Cyber Range for the commercial sector, at our new Security headquarters in Boston. Cyber Range uses live malware, ransomware and other real-world hacker tools culled from the dark web to deliver realistic cyber attack experiences. Clients learn how to prepare for and handle cyber attacks.
And Watson for Cyber Security is providing insights on live cyber attacks to 40 clients, including as you would expect several large financial institutions and universities, who are participating in our beta program. So for the Cognitive Solutions segment, we grew revenue and profit in the quarter, while we continued to embed cognitive into our offerings, scale our platforms, and build industry verticals.
Turning to Global Business Services, our performance reflects continued declines in the businesses we are shifting away from, such as large ERP engagements. From a line of business perspective, our consulting results were fairly consistent with our performance throughout the year, while application management decelerated.
We continue to aggressively shift our investments and resources to our digital practices, and growth in our strategic imperatives accelerated to 19% this quarter. Our cloud practice was up over 70%, mobile nearly 30%, and analytics was up 10%.
On a global basis, we continue to build out our digital design agency, the IBM Interactive Experience, which now has more than 30 global studios. In the fourth quarter, we announced a partnership with General Motors to bring the power of Onstar and Watson together to create the auto industry’s first cognitive mobility platform. 
Watson will learn the driver’s preferences, apply machine learning and sift through data to recognize patterns in their decisions and habits. This information will allow brand and marketing professionals working with Onstar to deliver personalized interactions that directly impact their target audiences. This solution brings together our cognitive technology with IBM differentiated data such as the rich weather data and IBM iX’s industry expertise in experience and mobile design.
As clients are looking to create new business models with our cognitive technologies, our industry experts in GBS are helping them scale. This quarter we announced a new global Watson IoT consulting practice to help clients introduce IoT innovation into their businesses. This will include 1,500 consultants, data scientists, and security experts with deep domain and industry expertise. We also announced that IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps can now be integrated with a broad set of Watson capabilities to increase the productivity and improve decision making for enterprise employees.
Turning to profit, GBS profit and margin were down. In the more traditional engagements, we continue to have some price and profit pressure. We continue to shift away from these areas to our digital businesses, adding nearly 8,000 resources to these practices in 2016. This impacts productivity in the near term. 
We’re investing in enablement, hiring top talent, and bringing in new skills through acquisitions. Profit this quarter also continues to reflect additional spending in some accounts to deliver on our client commitments. So for Global Business Services, we accelerated the growth in our digital practices, while managing a shift from the more traditional businesses, and we’re continuing to invest to build out capabilities and deliver on client commitments.
Technology Services and Cloud Platforms revenue was up 2% year-to-year, and pre-tax income was up 4%. Within this segment, our GTS revenue and backlog continues to grow. And this quarter we signed 16 deals greater than $100 million.
We are modernizing our offerings and helping our clients move to the cloud. Our strategic imperatives for this segment were up over 35%, with cloud up 50%. We continue to invest to build out our cloud infrastructure and we now have more than 50 cloud centers globally. 
In the fourth quarter, we acquired Sanovi Technologies, a cloud-native company that will enable us to deliver disaster recovery as a Service to clients undergoing digital and hybrid cloud transformation. This adds to our leading resiliency capabilities.
Looking at the lines of business, Infrastructure Services grew 3%. We built the IBM Cloud for the enterprise. Clients can mix bare metal servers, virtual servers, storage and networking to find the right balance for their workloads. Our enterprise workloads on our public cloud continue to scale, contributing to growth in our as-a-Service content. 
Clients continue to turn to us for enablement of their new digital businesses. These digital businesses require IT infrastructure that is always-on, available-everywhere, and of course secure. Clients often struggle with the complexity of sourcing and integrating IT services such as multiple cloud platforms, on premise data centers, and mobile environments. 
As a Services Integrator, we help clients navigate the complexity of their hybrid cloud environment and deliver the needed end-to-end infrastructure services solutions in an integrated and unified way.
For example, at a large Australian bank, we partnered with the client to build an IT architecture for the future. We are helping the bank design, build and manage a flexible hybrid cloud infrastructure. This solution automatically brokers, deploys, integrates and orchestrates across multiple environments and services. When the bank has a business need such as a new digital banking service, their IT is ready to support it immediately with a secure, integrated and optimized solution. 
We are the premier partner when it comes to hybrid cloud services integration. Our depth of capability and experience is unmatched in the industry. Technical Support Services was flat year-to-year and continues to generate substantial revenue and profit for our model. We are seeing growth in multi-vendor services, leveraging our global scale and deep technical skills.
We’ve expanded our multi-vendor services into industries like banking, retail and healthcare, and into technologies including ATMs, mobile, point of sale, and Internet of Things. Think of this as providing wall-to-wall support for our clients.
Integration Software grew again this quarter as we continue to see momentum in our hybrid cloud integration capabilities and WebSphere Application Server, which grew double digits. We continue to scale our Bluemix platform, which has grown rapidly to become one of the largest open public cloud deployments globally. 
Based on open standards, it features a robust set of high value services including our cognitive, weather and blockchain APIs. American Airlines named IBM as its cloud provider for greater enterprise flexibility and scale. As part of the partnership, they will move enterprise applications to the IBM Cloud, leveraging a wide range of application development capabilities through Bluemix.
At Majesco, the global provider of core insurance software and services, we announced a five year partnership where we’ll contribute cognitive APIs, that will allow insurance companies to better analyze, price, and understand business risk using new data sources such as the weather and social media. We’ll also add an engaging and personalized cognitive interface to their services.
And one of the largest banks in Thailand tapped Bluemix to build a new secure blockchain network to transform their credit approval process. 
Turning to profit, gross margin is down 1.4 points. Infrastructure Services margins were flat year to year, but Technical Support Services and Integration Software margins declined. In TSS we are shifting more of the business into multi-vendor services and in Integration Software we are shifting more capability to SaaS. This is impacting margins in the near term.
The IP partnerships are a headwind to gross profit margins in Integration Software, though a tailwind to pre-tax margin this quarter. Pre-tax profit for the segment is up, with margins expanding 40 basis points. We continue to focus on investing in our strategic areas, while innovating and driving productivity in our more traditional businesses.
So for Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we grew backlog, revenue and profit in the quarter, with continued strength in our hybrid cloud capabilities across services and software. These results reflect our success in modernizing the services that we provide to our clients.
Our Systems revenue reflects growth in z Systems, offset by declines in Power and storage as we continue to address shifting markets. Systems gross margin was up year to year due to both improvement in z margins, and the relative strength in that higher margin business.
In z Systems, we delivered 4% revenue growth, double-digit growth in MIPs, and we expanded our margins. These results reflect our continued success in driving innovation in our core systems. The mainframe is optimized for mobile and security, and is constantly being redesigned to drive new workloads, including instant payments and the
emerging blockchain. 
Eight quarters into the cycle, we added 8 new clients in the quarter, 29 for the year and 80 since inception. New client adoption at this stage in our cycle further validates our clients’ perceived value and their ongoing commitment to the IBM platform. Clients are investing heavily to meet the demands for future growth. 
I mentioned earlier the strength we had in China. We closed significant z Systems deals in the quarter, including two large Chinese banks migrating their mainframe install base to our latest z13 technology. And in Europe we are helping our clients manage new requirements in the rapidly evolving area of financial services modernization. We had four wins in the quarter on instant payments. 
Given the critical nature of the European financial services backbone, TARGET2-Securities, or T2S, has been deployed on IBM z Systems to provide the necessary reliability, scalability and IT security. 
Overall, the mainframe continues to deliver a high value, secure and scalable platform that is critical in managing our clients’ complex environments. Our Power performance reflects our ongoing shift to a growing Linux market while continuing to serve a high value, but declining, UNIX market. Linux workloads continued double-digit growth, and faster than the market, while the traditional UNIX base declined. 
We have been shifting our platform to address Linux, and with fully expanded Linux offerings, our Power-on-Linux represents over 15% of our overall portfolio. Supporting this is our success in HANA on Power. The Power platform is critical to the workloads a cognitive world will demand. 
And in the fourth quarter we saw this in the U.S. Department of Energy’s deployment of hundreds of IBM’s OpenPOWER servers. When complete, these two supercomputers will be among the world’s largest scientific and AI computing systems.
Storage hardware was down 10% this quarter, which reflects the shift in value towards software-defined environments. Storage revenue declines were mainly driven by midrange and high-end disk. However, we are now benefitting from a full suite of all flash array offerings and this portfolio grew double digits in the fourth quarter. We also continued to see double-digit revenue growth in Software-Defined Storage, particularly in our Spectrum Suite and Cloud Object Storage offerings, which is not reported in our Systems segment. Storage gross margins are down, as hardware continues to be impacted by both volume and price pressure.
So for Systems, our revenue and gross profit performance were driven by growth in z Systems, offset by Power and Storage declines. These results reflect the reinvention of our core systems for work in a new era of computing. We have optimized our systems to drive new types of workloads like blockchain and instant payments. We’re expanding our footprint, building new capabilities, and solving new types of problems for our clients. And though we are facing some shifting market dynamics and product transitions in both Power and Storage, our portfolio overall remains optimized to address the demands of an era of cognitive and cloud computing.
So now let me touch on our software performance across our segments. Our total software revenue was over $7 billion, up 1%. Software was up 1% for the year as well.
From a business area perspective this quarter, we had growth in Cognitive Solutions and Integration Software, while Operating Systems continued to be a drag, in line with the longer-term secular trend. Software annuity revenue was up mid-single digits, led by our SaaS offerings. Our software transaction revenue declined mid-single digits, which is a significant improvement from the performance in the first half. Given the seasonality in our software business, transactional revenue has a bigger impact on our total software performance in the fourth quarter.
So moving on to cash flow, in the quarter, we generated $5.6 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. We invested $900 million in CapEx, and generated $4.7 billion of free cash flow.
For the full year, we generated $15.3 billion of cash from operations. We invested $3.7 billion in CapEx this year, with over a $1 billion in support of our cloud and Solutions businesses, as well as a significant portion going to support our services backlog and our upcoming hardware cycles. And so we generated free cash flow of $11.6 billion, and as I mentioned earlier, our cash realization remained strong at just over 97% of GAAP net income, consistent with our longer-term model of realization in the 90’s.
So, our cash performance is right in line with our profit levels as we talked about all year, and includes significant cash payments related to the workforce rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year, as well as lower cash taxes. We did see an uptick in our working capital as we closed the year, which we attribute to timing and mix of substantial transactions in December.
Looking at uses of cash, we continued to strengthen our portfolio by investing $5.7 billion in acquisitions. We’ve acquired 15 companies in 2016, including three in the fourth quarter. The acquisitions added to our capabilities in cognitive and analytics, cloud and security, and significant transactions included The Weather Company, Truven Health, Promontory, and three digital marketing agencies.
Over the course of the year we’ve returned almost $9 billion to shareholders including dividends of over $5 billion and 3.5 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back over 23 million shares, reducing our average share count by just under 2.5%, which is in line with our longer-term model. At the end of the year, we had $5.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.5 billion. Total debt was just over $42 billion, of which about two-thirds was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business is seven to one and the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 52% investment grade, a point better than September. I will come back to a change we’ll be making to the structure of our financing business starting in 2017.
Our non-financing debt of $14.3 billion was $2 billion lower than September, resulting in a non-financing debt-to-cap of just under 50%, five points lower than September, and more importantly five points lower than a year ago. Our debt-to-cap ratio was impacted again this year by a reduction in equity due to pension re-measurement, a $1.6 billion reduction to equity, or about three points to the ratio.
Looking at our pension plans, as you know the U.S. plan has been frozen for some time, and the asset mix reflects that, with a relatively low risk, low return profile. The result of that is low odds of any required funding in the U.S. regardless of the interest rate environment. Our funding levels remain solid with the U.S. and worldwide tax-qualified plans at 102% and 98% respectively, a modest increase from last year. Information on the performance of our retirement-related assets, and return and discount rate assumptions at year-end are in our supplemental charts.
Importantly, our balance sheet continues to have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long term.
So now let me spend just a minute on our financing business. As part of our own transformation, we saw an opportunity to drive some operational benefits by changing the structure of our financing business.
First, let me say that the structure of the Global Financing segment that we report is unchanged. We have reorganized our client and commercial financing business as a wholly owned subsidiary, IBM Credit LLC. This combined corporate structure will, over time, meet its funding requirements by issuing debt directly to the market. This will drive operational benefits by consolidating the operations of our financing business. We will issue debt directly out of the new entity, and expect the entity to be able to access the capital markets later this year. And, we will increase our financing business leverage from seven to one to nine to one, which represents an increase of about $600 million in Global Financing debt.
But as I said, our Global Financing segment is unchanged, and will continue to include our client and commercial financing business as well as our hardware remanufacturing and remarketing business.
So let me wrap this up. We have a very clear point of view on what it takes to be successful with enterprise clients in this new era. I’ll shorthand it as cognitive, plus cloud, plus industry. And what differentiates IBM is the ability to bring all three together, to change real business processes and outcomes. Enterprise clients rely on us to help them run their processes. We have the relationships, we know their process and workflows, and importantly, we have their trust. This incumbency positions us very well to take our clients to the new era.
In 2016 we continued to make a lot of progress in the transformation of our own business. We had strong growth in our strategic imperatives, cloud, analytics, security and mobile. These offerings generated $33 billion in revenue, and now represent over 40% of our revenue. And they’re high value offerings, with a gross margin that raises overall IBM.
We also invested at a high level, through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships. In 2016 we spent nearly $6 billion in R&D, nearly $4 billion in capital expenditures, and nearly $6 billion to acquire 15 companies. We’re amassing a unique set of assets to build our cognitive solutions and cloud platforms, like the digital assets of The Weather Company, healthcare datasets from Truven and risk and compliance experts of Promontory. In 2016 we continued to remix our skills to new opportunities, while continuing to deliver innovation in our more traditional areas, like positioning z Systems as the ideal platform for blockchain, or Power for cognitive, or utilizing our intellectual property partnerships to extend some of our software assets.
So we’ll take all of these capabilities into 2017. Even recognizing the shifts in our industry, some country-specific challenges and opportunities, and some macro effects of currency and potential tax reform, as I said up front, we feel that we’re exiting 2016 in a stronger position than we entered it.
This confidence is reflected in our view of 2017. To simplify, we expect to stay on track in our strategic imperatives. We’ll continue to invest at a high level, though as you saw in the fourth quarter, after ramping investment from 2015 through late 2016, we’ve wrapped on that higher level. And we expect to grow our pre-tax income, and while there are a number of scenarios for tax, in all cases we expect tax to be a year-to-year headwind to our book rate in 2017. Put it all together, and we expect to deliver Operating EPS of at least $13.80 in 2017.
If you remember the first quarter of last year, we had a few larger items in our earnings, but they offset at the net income level. That first quarter was about 17% of our 2016 operating EPS. We expect a benefit from discrete tax again in the first quarter of this year, though smaller in size. And like last year, other actions will offset some portion of the benefit. With this, we expect a similar skew for 2017, with about 17% of the full year expectation of $13.80 in the first quarter.
Looking at cash flow for the year, we expect free cash flow realization in excess of 90% of GAAP net income, and we’ll return 70% to 80% of our cash flow to shareholders, both in line with our longer term model.
Bottom line, we feel good about the progress we made in 2016, and our prospects for 2017. And now, we’ll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the full year. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.
So let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Katy Huberty
Thank you, good afternoon. Just quick clarification and then I have question. The clarification is just it would helpful if you gave a little more insight as to what you’re expecting in terms of the range of outcomes for the tax rate both normalized rate and how much discrete items could be in the year and then similar for IP income just because those were so significant in 2016?
And then as it relates to my question which is on Watson, from the outside it seems this business gets pretty significant share of the press, but not contributing to revenue. Do you have visibility at as to when we should expect an inflection in revenue recognition from Watson, or should we just not think about this as a contributing factor or moving the needle in our models over the next couple of years?
Martin Schroeter
Okay, thanks Katy. A couple of things, on tax when we look at, as I in the prepared remarks, we do see tax as a headwind year-to-year, but remember we had last year a $1 billion, we won a tax case in Japan, so over $1 billion, which was in last year. That drives, by the way the bulk of the year-to-year headwind.
On a rate basis we finished this year we said 18 plus or minus 2, and we finished kind of at the bottom end of that range for the full year on an operating base obviously with on all in base with that Japan benefit from the first quarter and there it’s much lower, but we finished at the bottom end of that range. When we look at 2017, as I said in the prepared remarks all the scenarios point to a headwind. We’re right now thinking it’s about 15 plus or minus 3, and the reason we widened the range is because we are getting ready for tax reform here in the U.S. We don’t know yet what that looks like, we read the same things you do, but we are going to start now to prepare for tax reform, so we’ve widened the range this year to 15 plus or minus 3. That doesn’t have discretes in it.
On IP income as we said a number times we are trying to rebuild that base of business, it’s always been part of our income stream, it is a business where we’ve now had fair bit of success in rebuilding it and while we’re not relying on a big growth year-to-year, we do have in that particular line. A lot of this is already done quite frankly because we have these agreements in place that pay us royalties. And then we have a pretty good pool of opportunities that could get this back to again the same level that we printed this year. Again we’re not relying on that to within our guidance. Within our guidance I’d say we could be down year-to-year little bit. But again a lot of this is already done and we have a good pool of opportunities to drive IP again for what will be what 18 or 19 years of doing this. So we got, I think, a pretty good track record.
And then on Watson, Watson is in and you can see it in the Solutions Software business which accelerated. Again Watson, our Solutions Software is what’s being – or Watson is what’s driving that. Now Watson is a silver thread, it runs through the platform, it runs through Watson Health, it runs through Watson IoT, it’s in security now, right Watson is embedded in security.
And as we announced at the end of last year at Watson Financial Services, we will now embed the regulatory expertise of Promontory into Watson, so Watson will be part of that Financial Services industry solution content as well. So Watson is firmly, firmly established as the silver thread that runs through those cognitive solutions and you can see all of that in the solution software performance.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Katy let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. Martin, your free cash flow conversion of 90% plus in 2017 leads to about $10.2 billion at least in free cash flow, which is substantially down year-on-year. Can you help bridge the puts and takes here or what are the largest moving pieces to that conversion rate…
Martin Schroeter
No, I mean. Thanks, Wamsi. I guess the way I look at free cash flow conversion. As you know we guide on a conversion metric. But we see free cash flow basically flat year-to-year in 2017, not down. Now again, we give a range and that’s consistent with the model we have of being north of 90%, 90% to 100%. But we see free cash flow for the year to be flat. Now within that, as you know again we got our money back from Japan last year when we won our tax case so we’ve got that as a headwind. And within that and we’ll overcome that with the rest of the operations. But the other side of this is, we also holding if you will an ability to grow our capital investments within that flat as well. So it was not I mean you shouldn’t interpret that 90% is down, we see free cash flow flat with a tax headwind which will overcome and room to grow CapEx.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Wamsi. Sam. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess my question broadly and we give this a fair amount is IBM’s gross margin profile over the last several quarters. Especially across the cognitive segment specifically, but broadly has degraded pretty consistently. I realize you guys have a lot of investments but also is it organic but just talk about when do you think gross margins start to stabilize. And at what point do you think at least on the cognitive side the acts as-a-service business start to become more in line to the cognitive segment margin profile.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, thanks. Okay, sure. So on cognitive solutions, its been a year that you really have to go back to understand where we finished in the fourth. And I’m going to talk specifically about the fourth in a moment but you have to go back to what we’ve been talking about within cognitive solutions all year. So in the first quarter we saw the steepest year-to-year decline in margins, driven by a heavily by our investments – heavily by our need to remix our skills. And also by we had acquisitions and while currency was a big headwind in dollars for us last year was also an impact to our margin.
So as we progressed through the year when we get the fourth. On a gross profit margin basis we were down about three points which I would put in currency and acquisitions is all of that three. And so on a PTI margin basis in the fourth we were down about less about half, little bit less than half about 1.4 points. And within that again currency and acquisitions drove three points so everything else in cognitive solutions within the PTI margin.
The mix of the annuity business the ramp of our as-a-service business, the benefit we get from our licensing our IP and the offsetting royalties that are coming. And everything else improved operating PTI margin in the fourth quarter. And so what you saw in 2016 in cognitive segment margins on PTI was an operating margin that went up pretty dramatically as we went quarter-to-quarter like 17 points, right from first all the way to fourth.
And next year, I don’t know when currency is going to ramp but we do know it’s much less of a headwind next year than it was this year at least at current rates. And we also know that we ramp on the acquisitions. So those things that have dragged us dragged our margins down are starting to go away and while gross profit. We don’t see that I don’t see that deteriorating by three points like it did in the fourth anymore. And in fact PTI margins I think are much, much more stable going forward, which is what we’re assuming. Now they don’t have to be flat, we’re still going to drive our as-a-service performance we are going to continue to drive these IP deals, which throw a little bit of royalty into the GP stream but I see a much improved cognitive segment PTI margin from what we experienced in the fourth. And again you saw in the fourth we ramped on our heavy investment levels here as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Amit. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Tien-tsin Huang
Thank you so much. Just wanted to – I guess better understand this global financing change and what’s driving that. Are you increasing your leverage to support clients and anything needs in 2017 or is it just a tool to lie [ph] to increase your debt overall leverage and efficiencies just want to better understand that.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks Tien-tsin. So there are some really important benefits here as we align kind of the legal and the capital structure of our financing business that just by itself will drive pretty substantial operational benefits. It gives us better capital structure flexibility in each of the countries in which IGF operates. IGF by the way doesn’t operate in 172 like all of IBM does its more like 45 but it allows for better capital structure in that more limited set of countries in which they operate. It gives us better efficiency of cash allocation.
So what – we are really doing here as we are taking the interest earning part of IGF, the client financing and the commercial financing, we put those into a subsidiary. We will provide – be providing more information externally. So you can see everyone can see what the capacity for them to borrow and that’s really the borrowing capacity of IGF the remarketing business does not support a borrowing capacity its a very high margin, it’s a very high return but the interest bearing portion of IGF is really what supports the debt. 
And so we’re going to issue debt directly out of that entity. It’ll allow us to add $600 million or so of debt because that portfolio was high enough quality that it can run at higher leverage. That’s by the way more consistent with what we see in other entities of this nature. So we’ll run it slightly higher leverage that will improve the ROE, that will free up basically some equity if you will that we have in IGF it will free up some equity in mainline. But it’s not a change to necessary to the overall debt levels it’s really a change to IGF and its efficiency the operational benefits we get and our ability then to pull a little bit of capital out of idea. But also manage it better in which in the countries in which it operates. But again importantly the segment that you see won’t change. So this really is a change in how we access the capital markets externally.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Tien-tsin. Sam, can we take the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes, thank you. Martin if I think about 2016 in total relative to your guidance at the beginning of the year it benefited about $1.20 in EPS from IP gains and lower tax rate not including the Japanese tax settlement. So on a fundamental basis, earnings went from about $14.02 in 2015 to about $12.50 in 2016. So as we look to 2017, you’re guiding for an improvement in earnings from $13.50 to $13.80. And you said tax is going to be a headwind, you’ve said IP income is not going to help if anything it might hurt. So the last three years you’ve actually had fundamental erosion if we take out tax and IP in your business.
And you’re calling for an inflection point in 2017. So I’m wondering if you can talk through what are the key things that drive that improvement and perhaps you could also be explicit about what your expectation for acquisitions and their contribution for restructuring expense and whether that will be a net, we’ll have any net impact on results and what your assumption is for cash tax versus accrue tax in 2017 as well? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Okay, sure. Thanks Toni. So a couple of things when we entered 2016 as I said earlier on a prior question, we said tax would be 18 plus or minus two and we came in again at the bottom of the range. And so now when we look at tax, yes, we had $1 billion improvement from Japan, which we are not – obviously we’re not going to win another tax case in Japan by the way. But we do have discrete this year.
When we look at where we finished, we finished at the bottom of that range. And as I said with us going into now 2015 into 2017 at a 15 rate plus or minus three we have to overcome if you will the headwind from the Japan. But we’re going to as we plan for tax reform we don’t see a fundamentally different operating tax picture than we saw last year in our I&E. We saw an inflection point it’s probably you know maybe that’s the right way to think about it. We saw an inflection point in intellectual property income this year. And I can tell you that yes, we see an inflection point in profitability our PTI we expect to improve that’s embedded within our earnings.
So we saw an inflection point in IP income but then you get to the engineer and you want to take it all out. So that we hit an inflection point in IP last year, we did better than we had the prior year. And it’s always been a part of our model and again we see while it may not continue exactly we’re not relying on all of that for the year. We will have IP income a substantial amount of IP income as we always have for the last I don’t know 18, 19 years you have the history as well.
So we do see an inflection point in our margin profile remember that we have gotten a lot done this year in terms of getting margins stabilized. We see that for instance in our infrastructure services business which drew margins for the year. We did get wrapped if you will on the higher levels of investment and spending and you see that in our cognitive solutions and I talked about that earlier. So and you see it on in our E2R [ph] performance on SG&A for instance in the fourth quarter alone. So as we get into now – as we get into 2017 and all of the work we got done plus we’ve got a better base on which our as-a-service margins are still continuing to grow because we’re not where we wants to be yet but we did improve throughout the year.
We have a momentum if you will in our cognitive solutions business and again those are high value. And we’ll get all the – whatever savings if we have from workforce rebalancing both as we continue to remix our workforce. So yes, I am saying that PTI margin and PTI growth this year is what is implied in our guidance now with the tax headwind it doesn’t translate as much to EPS growth but we do see the inflection points in parts of our business and including our margin profile.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you. Can we go to the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is now open.
Lou Miscioscia
Okay, great. Thank you. You maybe go into more detail in GBS like the last quarter you had said that over 50% of the revenue has transitioned into the digital practice area and that was growing in double-digits. So looking at this quarter obviously it seems like it’s fallen back a little bit, many others are growing application management just if you can help us out what’s going on under the coverage there why it seems that which should have improved in – obviously it didn’t and what you think about that going forward.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks, Lou. So the dynamics in GBS were similar to what we talked about in prior quarters we said a couple of things. One we are continuing to remix their skills and while we have a good performance in our strategic imperatives and that those digitized offerings. We still do have a pretty large book of business that’s in our part of the marketplace that has very heavy price pressure as all of us are competing to get kind of that foothold if you will or competing for certain kinds of opportunities and some of these accounts. So we’ve got price pressure in parts of the business and again we’re remixing our skills which as we said will have an impact the shorter term impact on productivity.
Now shorter term we invest in businesses for a long, long periods of time. So I don’t define shorter term is every 90 days. Although this business this business should start to improve when we – as we’ve talked about last time when we see a couple of things. So the backlog in GBS is down and so our first focus has to be to take the skills we’re building and get a good signings, a good consistent signings performance in order to grow the backlog once you grow the backlog then obviously you deliver in an efficient and effective way. And you start to improve your margins and we still view GBS is being able to get that done in fact. We’d say we will grow signings in the first quarter this year. So maybe we’ll start that position now but we still see this business and these skills at such a key differentiator in the marketplace that. We’re unwilling if you will to reduce our capacity or our capabilities in the marketplace. We really this is the third leg if you will between cognitive and a robust cloud. Industry skills are going to – what brings it all together so GBS is in a similar dynamic. I do think will grow signings in the first which will be the start to having that business improve. But it’s going to take a little while longer to get through these same dynamics, our remixing skills and moving our skills away from these heavily priced pressured opportunities.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Lou. Sam, can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Brian White with Drexel Hamilton. You may ask your question.
Brian White
Hey, Martin. So it sounds like the PTI margin will expand in the 2017, maybe just look at gross margins. You think gross margins will expand and if you can just give us a view on – the major business segments where should we expect improvement in the PTI margin in 2017? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks Brian. So a couple of things, we have is as we always, do we have a bunch of scenarios on how a year might fold out, roll out, right. So I would say that as you pointed out PTI margin expansion is in every scenario. That’s evidenced by the fact that profit is growing, it’s implied to grow with the tax headwind and then EPS obviously with a little bit of growth. So PTI margin growth is in each of the scenarios.
GP margin is not necessarily required for us to grow PTI margin and that’s for a couple. Now I’m not saying that peak that GP is necessarily going to go down but we can maintain our GP margins, we can even erode a little bit if we want to accelerate our move into as-a-service even faster. As you saw we had very good growth in our – as-a-service business in the fourth.
Overall those margins are below our IBM margin, so there’s a little bit of margin pressure as you make that shift, but we can deliver 2017 push as-a-service margins it’s really hard either maintain or you can even contract GP margins a little bit and still grow PTI margins given that we’ve ramped on, again this heavy level of investment and we’ve gotten a lot done on structure both the overall IBM structure, the infrastructure of what runs IBM, as well as each of the business have taken another good look at structure.
So from a segment perspective we saw good performance in our global technology services business. When you look at the infrastructure services piece growth and margins for the full year and I’d say that we can see opportunity to continue to grow margins there. The technical support services, the TSS business is where the margin pressure was in 2016, but I think we have a way to stabilize that margin performance, a very much is a mix shift from as we drive the multi vendor services business in TSS.
So margin improvements in the infrastructure services business I see relatively flat profit margins and systems. Now we’re coming off of a high point in the mainframe. At the end of the cycle margins tend to be higher. As you go into a new cycle they tend to be a little bit lower. But we also have an opportunity to improve in the other businesses. So systems margins relatively flat and we see again an opportunity to improve margins in GBS. As we get some of the work that I’ve described they are done and get kind of the power to shift through the way, we can see improvements in GBS.
And I talked earlier about cognitive solutions, so I won’t cover that again. So again PTI we do see growing. GP not necessarily, we don’t need GP to grow in order to produce PTI margin growth.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Brian. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is now open.
Steve Milunovich
Thank you very much. Martin, I think you talked about $2 billion of savings from the workforce rebalancing and so forth a year ago. I was curious how much of that did you see last year, how much of it is going to be seen in 2017, and how much of that in 2017 May you take to the bottom line because that strikes me, that’s a big part of this PTI improvements.
And also just wanted to ask and you might want to actually respond to this that where are you in the innings in your transformation. It’s been a number of years now. How far into it are you? And then just qualitatively what surprised you positively and what’s been very difficult to change in terms of changing IBM.
Martin Schroeter
Okay. Well, that’s a lot there Steve. So first on the workforce rebalancing savings, we said for last year, for 2016 that we would see a bit more than $500 million and we absolutely got that. And we said we would free up then $2 billion of total spend, some of which will get reinvested, some of which will go to the bottom line. You saw from our view of 2017 now that we’ve ramped, we’re not obviously reinvesting all of that although we ramped on our higher levels of spending, so obviously some of that’s going to wind up in the profit. And with mid single-digit profit growth it’s a fair bit drives that profit growth in 2017.
In the innings, you know what, IBM is always transforming. So I don’t know how to pick an inning other than to say that we have established a few years ago, we established this idea that the strategic imperatives were the path for revenue growth to resume and those continue to grow quite well. Then last year we changed the segment structure and said, look, we’re going to now report not only more detail on the strategic imperatives, but we’re going to talk to you about cognitive solutions which has all the Watson content. We’re going to talk to you about a cloud platform business and we’re going to talk to you obviously about the industry dimension.
And so that part of the transformation continuous and I don’t think that that transformation of IBM ever ends quite frankly. We are back now as we put in our guidance; we are back to our model level of pre-tax income growth as we have in our model right now. Now if you say that pre-tax income growth – if for the model – achieving the model is the definition of when the transformation is done, then I’d say that we see that this year for pre-tax income.
Now we’ve got a lot of other elements of our financial model as well. We’ve been returning cash to our shareholders consistently, we have generated our free cash flow as a percentage of our net income has been on model. So we’ve had a number of elements that are on model. Pre-tax income growth I think is a good one that says this structure, the strategy is working and it will drive the financial model we set out to achieve, at least on the pre-tax income growth which had been missing.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Steve. Can we please go to the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Joe Foresi
Hi, I thought I’d ask that progress question a little bit differently. Can you give us some thoughts on your expectations for growth in the strategic imperatives and the decline in the core business in 2017? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure Joe. So, we said a few years ago that strategic imperatives would be $40 billion and 40% by 2018 and as you just saw we finished 2016 when they’re 41%. So obviously we made the mix piece of this early. But from here if we grow, say, 10% to 11% we get to 40% by 2018. And so with such a substantial part now of our business at $30 billion plus with such a substantial part of our business to grow that at that continued double-digit says that we have the right offerings in the right spaces with the right skills to deliver them and they are robust powerful solutions. And so we see that kind of growth in order to get to the 40%. We still think we’re quite confident; we’re ahead actually of track, but we’re quite confident in getting to the 40% still.
The core business or the rest of the business if you will is always has a few components in it. One, at our very core, remember, that we are delivering productivity to our clients, and so they use that that productivity that we deliver to reinvest. And as we said before that’s the dynamic you see in our revenue stream. We deliver productivity through parts of our business and they reinvest and that’s how you get the revenue dynamic that we have.
The core was down double-digit two years ago and down 9% in the fourth, if you do the math roughly down 9%. And when we get into this year, I’d say that we’ll see a kind of a similar dynamic but that’s what we are – that’s what is sort of embedded within our guidance for 2017. So continued good performance in strategic imperatives, continued focus on delivering productivity for our clients and we’ll have that revenue dynamic into 2017.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Sam. Why don’t we take one last question?
Operator
Certainly. Our last question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.
David Grossman
Thanks. Actually Martin if I could just ask two questions really quickly. One is just into your last answer. So if you are growing at 11% in the strategic and you are pretty close to 50-50, I think you’re at 44% in the fourth quarter and the core is declining 9%. I mean wouldn’t that imply that we’re reasonably close to getting to a crossover on the top line.
Martin Schroeter
Did you want to ask your second question first, or do you want me to answer that one?
David Grossman
Well, the second – Why do you answer that first and then I will go to the second one.
Martin Schroeter
Okay. So when you say we were down on a constant currency basis, we were down 70 basis points in the fourth. So I think we are reasonably close in the third. Yes, this is the structure we are in. And we are focused on driving value in those strategic imperatives not just grabbing a little bit of revenue to have some math work out differently.
And our margins in the strategic imperatives continue to be higher than overall IBM and higher obviously than the core, so our focus on delivering value hasn’t changed. And whenever that crossover point happens to be, yes, we’re already close. So when you say wouldn’t it imply, yes, we’re close, we were close in the fourth. But we’re focused on delivering value, and for 2017 we’re focused on obviously PTI margin expansion.
David Grossman
Right. And the second piece is, if historical trend repeats itself, you’re due for a mainframe product cycle in the back half of the year. I believe the way you break it out at least some of that mainframe revenue is in strategic imperatives. So that said how should we be thinking of the potential financial impact of the next mainframe cycle vis-a-vis prior cycles, particularly given some of the secular shifts that you’ve talked about in your prepared remarks and in response to some of the other question?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. So, yes, I mean, we – if you follow a mainframe cycle then it would say sometime late this year we’d have another mainframe. But again, we wouldn’t see the impact of that until late in the year. What drives the mainframe as it always has is our ability to make it relevant to the workloads that our clients need.
So when we were together when we announced the last mainframe, and two years ago we talked a lot about this shift to mobile. We talked a lot about security. We talked within those two elements and there’s a lot more to it. But within those two elements we talked about how the mainframe was built particularly with those two kinds of workloads in mind and that drove the growth we saw in the mainframe through the cycle. That’s still by the way part of the growth we see in the mainframe and it’s still why – that’s why big enterprises continue to put their most important work on mainframes.
Now the set of workloads that are going to drive the next incantation of the mainframe are going to be things like Blockchain, and so all of that is still ahead of us. We added and we said in the prepared remarks, we added a number of new clients throughout the cycle but we added more again in the fourth quarter as well.
And while I haven’t talked to every one of them, I think what they’re thinking, what many of them are thinking is yes, I need mobile, and yes, security is more important than ever, but I also need to be ready for the next workload drivers. And Blockchain is a good example of a workload driver that is ideally suited for the most robust enterprise platform there is. So I think that if I had to pick just one that drives the mainframe is Blockchain. It would be my first top of my list for what drives the next mainframe cycle.
So let me wrap up the call by saying again that we’re really pleased with the progress we made in 2016 and how we’re positioned for 2017. Of course there’s plenty for us to work on, we’re not confused by that. But we are looking forward to continuing this dialogue at our investor briefing later in the quarter.
So with that, thank you for joining the call.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. In the third quarter, we generated $19.2 billion in revenues, $3.7 billion in pre-tax income and $3.29 of operating earnings per share. As we think back to the discussion 90 days ago, it was around Brexit and its impact on Europe, global spending and sectors like banking and the attractiveness of investment in the emerging markets, all of these topics have the capacity to drive some volatility and results, but what you see in our third quarter results is stability in our revenue with continued strong growth and strategic imperatives and a top and bottom line consistent with what we expected.
Our revenue was essentially flat relative to last year. Looking at the revenue dynamics, I want to point out a few things. Our clients are focussed on becoming digital businesses and have strong growth in cloud, security, mobile, and across our analytics portfolio reflects this. In total, we continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our strategic imperatives led by our cloud business.
Cloud delivered as-a-service is part of a solid recurring revenue base across software and services, and our annuity revenue continued to grow. Of course, the acquisitions we made in the last 12 months contributed to growth about the same amount as last quarter and for the first time in quite a while currency was a modest tailwind to revenue growth. I’ll talk to our revenue at constant currency going forward.
Looking at revenue from a segment perspective, we had very good performance in both cognitive solutions and technology services and cloud platforms. Cognitive solutions were up 5% and within that solution software was up 8%. Technology services and cloud platforms revenue also grew with continued strength in our infrastructure services and growth in integration software as we help our clients build hybrid cloud capabilities. And with another quarter of signings growth our GTS backlog is up year-to-year.
Global business services made some progress this quarter in revenue trajectory as we continue to shift and mix to a digital offerings. Our systems revenue was down this quarter. The z Systems performance reflects the fact that we are seven quarters into the product cycle where POWER reflects the secular decline in UNIX mitigated by growth in Linux. There is a tremendous amount of change in our industry and we are continuing to invest where we see the best opportunities.
With this, we are addressing new opportunity areas and building new markets as well as delivering innovation in our existing businesses. We are investing organically and we are acquiring key capabilities. We are remixing their skills, and we’ve had success in rebuilding our IP income base, utilizing partnerships that enable us to continue to innovate in some of the more traditional high value areas of the business.
With all of that, we continue to have a very high margin business and we generate a lot of profit in cash. Our results reflect the success we are having and helping our clients to leverage cloud for speed and innovation and become cognitive businesses. You see this in the growth in our strategic imperatives which were up 15%.
Over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered nearly $32 billion in revenue and now represent 40% of IBM. We had strong performance in our cloud offerings which were up over 40% led by our as-a-service offerings. We exited the third quarter with an as-a-service run rate of $7.5 billion. That’s up from $6.7 billion last quarter and the bulk of the increases organic. So we are building scale in these businesses.
We also had strong revenue performance in security and in mobile and we had strong growth in our analytic offerings which were up 14% this quarter with contribution from the core analytics platform to cognitive offerings including Watson platform, Watson Health and Watson IoT.
We are building the industry’s broadest and deepest cognitive solutions and cloud platform portfolio and we are extending our capabilities. For example, this quarter we continued the global expansion of our cloud footprint and we now have 49 cloud centers. We formed a partnership with Workday, where IBM cloud will become the foundation for Workday’s development and testing environment. And we extended our partnership with VMware to enable easy hybrid cloud adoption.
As we’ve talked about in the past, cognitive is about using data and adding intelligence into products and services to help clients make better decisions. It’s about augmenting human intelligence. This quarter, we introduced and expanded Watson platform offerings including Watson conversation service and Watson virtual agent for customer service. We are training Watson for cyber security, expanding the amount of security data Watson is injecting. In Watson Health, we launched Watson for drug discovery and Watson Health core and in Watson IoT we added new capabilities around block chain and security to draw insights from billions of sensors embedded in everything from machines to cars, to drones to ball bearings to buildings and even to hospitals.
Where we are seeing real value is in providing cognitive capabilities in the IBM cloud, the third critical element of our strategy is our industry focus, and in the third quarter we introduced an industry platforms business that integrates cloud, cognitive industry and ecosystems capabilities to provide targeted solutions in specific industries. Initially industry platforms will address two substantial opportunity areas, once in financial services and block chain solutions. We believe block chain has the potential to do for trusted transactions what the internet did for information. We are building a complete block chain platform and are now working with over 300 clients to pioneer block chain for business, including CLS, who settles $5 trillion per day in the currency markets to implement a distributed ledger in support of its payment netting service and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi for smart contracts to manage service level agreements and automate multi party transactions.
And in the third quarter, we opened the block chain innovation center in Singapore to accelerate block chain adoption for finance and trade and we now have block chain garages opened in New York, London, Tokyo, Singapore and San Francisco.
In Watson Financial Services just a couple of weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, a leader in regulatory compliance and a risk management consulting. So just as we trained Watson on clinical research and medical guidelines to work with doctors treating cancer, we will apply the expertise of Promontory to train Watson to directly address escalating regulations, their risk management requirements in financial services.
I’ll expand on some of these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions, but first let me walk through our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was $19.2 billion. As I just mentioned currency was a modest tail wind to growth, about 80 basis points this quarter.
On a geographic basis, we had sequential improvements in both the Americas and Europe. The Americas revenue was flat as compared to last year and the U.S. was also flat. Latin America was up 5% led by Brazil. While the environment remains uncertain, double-digit growth of Brazil this quarter reflects the importance of our z Systems platform to the banking sector.
Europe performance improved four points sequentially, driven by the U.K. Germany, France and the Nordics. Asia Pacific decelerated including a decline in Japan and weaker performance in China. India continued to post strong results. Our gross margin was down this quarter, across the business the decline is driven by higher level of investments including the acquisitions we have made and the mix to as-a-service businesses that aren’t yet at scale. I’ll address the margin dynamics that are segment specific within the segment discussions.
Our expense overall is down versus last year. I want to spend a minute on a few of the expense drivers. We’ve been investing at a higher level, both in organic capabilities like cognitive, security, cloud and block chain but also through acquisitions. When we look at the acquisitions we have done over the last 12 months, this drove about five points of expense growth.
As we look at our investment levels, we want to allocate our skills to where we see the most opportunity in growth. Some of our assets are high value, but not necessarily in growing markets, so we are licensing not selling our intellectual property to partners who are allocating their skills to extend the value of these assets.
This quarter, we signed three such agreements resulting in a higher level of IP income. Licensing as a part of a broader partnership to drive future innovation is a relatively new model for us. It allows us to retain and potentially grow the revenue stream while shifting our spending profile to a more variable cost structure. IP income is just one way that we monetize our technology, sometimes selling our intellectual property, other times licensing IP.
The last thing I want to mention relative to expense is that we continue to have a year-to-year impact from currency, not only from the translation, but also as we wrap on last years’ hedging gains. This drove a three point impact to expense, so while currency is a modest help to the top line, we continue to have a meaningful impact to our year-to-year profit. Put it all together, and our reported expense is better 2% versus last year.
Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing effective tax rate of 18% for the year which is in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year of 18% plus or minus a couple of points. It also includes a discreet benefit for closure of our foreign tax audit which lowered the tax rate in the quarter by two points.
From a cash perspective, we generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and nearly $13 billion over the last 12 months. This was over 100% of our GAAP net income and over the same period we returned about two thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now turning to our segments, our cognitive solutions revenue was up 5% which is a sequential improvement from the second quarter’s rate. Our solutions software revenue was up 8% while transaction processing software was down 2%. Analytics was a growth driver and we grew revenue in all spectrums of Watson. We saw strong SAS performance with double digit growth in revenue. Overall, gross margin was down due to the mix shift to SAS and the acquisition content.
Our pre tax income performance also reflects ongoing higher levels of investment in strategic growth areas like our Watson businesses. Our Analytics business which is the largest portion of the solution software portfolio grew again in key areas such as information integration, big data and Watson.
Watson underpins our cognitive strategy and continues to gain momentum. Watson’s conversation service launched in July provides developers a simple and easy entry into the next generation of engagement, through quick set up and tooling developers without deep machine expertise can leverage the science of Watson to develop engagement experiences across multiple channels. We introduced our Watson virtual agent for customer service building on our conversational capability to provide a cognitive repeatable application trained for customer service.
For example, we recently announced that the Royal Bank of Scotland will begin using a Watson Powered Chatbot for customer service. The Chatbot will help seamlessly route customer service request through the correct channels and answer specific banking queries.
Turning to our vertical plays, we are focussed on scaling our Watson Health business. We have over 7000 employees and target four major areas, life sciences, oncology, imaging and value based care. We launched new offerings, such as Watson for drug discovery which is a cloud based scalable platform that helps life science researchers discover new disease pathways, new drug targets and additional drug indications. We had several major client wins, including UPMC and Best Doctors.
And earlier this month, we announced a strategic alliance with Siemens, to help health care providers deliver value based care-to-patients with chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer. With Siemens, we’ll focus on accelerating U.S. adoption of Watson’s population health management offerings. Siemens will use the Watson Health Cloud as its preferred global technology platform. We’ve also been growing our geographic footprint, expanding it to China, South Korea, Finland and the United Kingdom this quarter alone.
Hospitals in both China and South Korea announced plans to adopt Watson for our oncology. And in Finland, we announced a partnership with the Finnish government that will utilize Watson cognitive computing to help doctors improve the health of its citizens. Their vision is to build an open health care ecosystem based on compliant and efficient utilization of healthcare data, so Finland will put their healthcare data on our Watson Health Cloud.
When you think about an entire country and trusting us with its healthcare data, this should give you some perspective as to how clients believe we have the right technology and consider us a trusted partner to drive healthcare innovation. This builds on a similar announcement we made with the government of Italy earlier this year.
We also made great progress in Watson IoT. We opened our German location where we will co-create with our clients. We added new capabilities to our offerings. So now you can share IoT data from connected devices on a block chain, proactively identify potential security risks and protect devices, and tap the Watson IoT platform to develop new voice interfaces for customers all by leveraging these capabilities. IBMs leadership in IoT was recently highlighted by IDC. We more than doubled the number of new clients on our IoT platform in the quarter including Schaeffler and Thomas Jefferson University hospital.
Schaeffler, one of the world’s leading automotive suppliers based in Germany is using Watson IoT to transform its business from its supply chain through to manufacturing and sales. This is a good example of how deeply embedded into our clients businesses we are becoming down to the ball bearing themselves. We are seeing exponential growth in both devices and developers and now we are expanding our industry differentiation and our reach with Watson Financial services.
As I mentioned last month, we announced plans to acquire Promontory. Together, we will create cognitive solutions for risk and compliance. Global business services delivered $4.2 billion of revenue with a one point improvement in growth trajectory from last quarter. Our digital practises which now make up more than half of GBS were up double digits with strong growth in cloud analytics and mobile. Our cloud practise was up nearly 70% this quarter as we build and implement digital strategies to move our clients to the cloud.
By line of business, we grew 2% in application management driven by growth in our digital foundation and mobile platforms. This was offset by a decline in consulting revenue as some larger contracts went down and clients continue to move away from on-premise enterprise application work to new business models focused on digital and cloud.
Enterprises are looking for new ways to reach their customers and empower their employees to make faster decisions. We continue to see strong double digit growth in our enterprise mobility that are helping clients redesign work flows with specific industry context. Our growing collection of mobile first for our IoS applications are delivered on the cloud and can connect back to their core systems and infrastructure. This is reinventing the way employees make real time decisions by putting the POWER of the enterprise in their hands. We continue to bring new customers onto the platform, including VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, RIMAC Insurance in Peru, and Amica Insurance here in the U.S.
We also opened a new IBM mobile first garage in Bangalore, part of the network of centers that helps clients around the world achieve mobile-led digital transformations, at speed and at scale.
Turning to profit, GBS gross profit margin was down 90 basis points. We expanded margins and application management as we mixed a new cloud in digital platforms. And with the benefit from our work force rebalancing actions, we are driving productivity in our delivery model. Consulting gross profit margin was down reflecting the investments we are making to grow our digital practises. Also, there were some accounts that required additional spending to deliver on important commitments; these dynamics are also reflected in our PTI margin. We are continuing to shift the business as we’ve added nearly 10,000 resources over the past year to our strategic imperatives. The acquisitions we have done over the last year impact our near term profit but add important capabilities, like cloud consulting skills around workday in salesforce.com. We’ve also expanded the IBM Interactive experience in our digital design capabilities. We are focussed on integrating and scaling these new skills as we continue to expand our digital practises.
Technology services and cloud platforms delivered $8.7 billion of revenue and grew 1% year-to-year. Global technology services again grew signings and backlog and has now grown revenue for six consecutive quarters. As we shift from systems integration to services integration we continue to see momentum in our new offerings. Across the segment our strategic imperatives were up over 40% with cloud up over 50% and the as-of-service runrate up over 60%.
Looking at the lines of business, infrastructure services was up 2% as our hybrid cloud strategy continues to resonate with our clients. We provide enterprise grade cloud solutions that are secure, agile and leverage the data and investment in their core systems. We continue to expand our cloud infrastructure announcing the opening of new cloud centers in South Korea and Norway this quarter. We now have 49 centers around the world enabling low latency connectivity to cloud infrastructure.
And moving to the cloud, our clients need to be sure that data is secure. Those in regulated industries need to know where their data is and many need to keep it in country. Our cloud infrastructure allows clients automatically to provision virtual with bare metal service while meeting their data sovereignty and regulatory requirements.
At JFE Steel, one of the largest steel manufacturers in the world, we announced the five year outsourcing agreement that will migrate core systems to the IBM cloud through a hybrid solution that will consolidate their infrastructure and streamline business operations. This will allow the company to speed up system development and services deployment, strengthen IT governance and reduce cost.
And last week, we announced a new cloud object storage service that will enable clients to scale large unstructured data volumes across hybrid cloud environments. Italy has adopted this new object storage service to more quickly and easily analyse data that’s being produced by the more than the 10 million clicks it processes each month.
Looking at the software component of our hybrid cloud solutions, integration software grew 4%. We saw a continued strength in our connect products that integrate applications, data and processes for on-premise and cloud environments. We also grew in some of our mission critical offerings such as Webster application server. We continued to shift more of our portfolio to another service model to our bluemix cloud platform which continues to scale across a broad catalog of high value services including cognitive, weather, internet of things and block chain APIs.
We continue to build our partnerships and eco systems to help clients move to the IBM cloud, through our partnership with VMware nearly a 1000 clients have begun moving their VMware environments to the IBM cloud including Marriott International, Clarient Global and Monitise. We are helping organisations extend existing workloads to the cloud in hours versus weeks or months.
Turning to profit, our gross margin for technology services and cloud platforms was about flat year-to-year. We expanded margins and infrastructure services as we see the benefit from productivity actions we’ve taken and continue to streamline our processes. We are investing in our technology and using our cognitive capabilities to shift to a more automated delivery model to improve performance and drive efficiencies.
Our technical support services margin declined, driven by the mix to our multi vendor support offerings. Our PTI margin also reflects these dynamics as well as the continued investments we are making to build out our cloud platforms.
Turning to our systems segment, there are some important market shifts in this business like spinning disc to flash, the rising importance of the hyperscale data market and new opportunities in block chain. We are shifting our business, delivering innovation in our offerings and introducing significant new capabilities. As always, our performance in the period is based on product cycle dynamics and portfolio transitions, and given where we are in the transitions and POWER and storage and in product cycles more broadly our revenue and profit is down after a strong 2015.
Our z Systems results reflect a product cycle dynamics, seven quarters into the z13 cycle; revenue was down while margins continue to expand. We continue to add new clients to the platform and we are introducing new technologies like block chain. We announced new services to make it easier to build and test block chain networks in a secure environment as we build our block chain platform it’s been engineered to run on multiple platforms but is optimized for scale, security and resilience on both the IBM mainframe and the IBM cloud.
As z Systems are well suited for these new workloads, due to its advanced security features that help protect data and ensure the integrity of the overall block chain networks. We are currently working with over 40 clients on pilot block chain used cases running on z.
Our POWER performance reflects both our performance in a declining UNIX market as well as our growth in a growing Linux market. While our margins were relatively stable at the high end of POWER, mid and low end margins were down, driving a decline in overall POWER margins.
We’ve been shifting our platform to address Linux and in the third quarter Linux grew at a double digit rate and faster than the market. It now comprises over 15% of our POWER revenue. Supporting that is their success with HANA where we are bringing in new clients and were replicating this strategy with others. This quarter, we expanded our Linux only server portfolio leveraging OpenPOWER partnerships to deliver a new high performance computing chip and system with NVIDIA GPU acceleration and new data optimized servers.
And our POWER architecture had another win, this time for a major hyperscale data center with one of the world’s largest internet providers based in China. And finally at the end of September, we introduced new POWER midrange in high end systems designed for hybrid cloud computing and flexible consumption models to transform on-premise IT to the cloud.
So in POWER, we are shifting to Linux while continuing to serve the high value UNIX base, but this is a long transition. In the near term we are focussed on stabilizing the margin base.
Storage hardware was down 9% this quarter reflecting the ongoing shift in value towards software. Gross margin is down reflecting both volume and price pressure. The hardware decline was mainly driven by low end and mid range traditional disc storage. Our high end disc storage grew this quarter. All flash array revenue grew as we have expanded our flash technology across our product portfolio. We recently rolled out new products and transition to a full suite of flash offerings making us competitively positioned, and while now in our system segment we also continue to see double digit revenue growth in software-defined storage, so across system, we're facing product cycle headwinds and some transitions in POWER and storage, while continuing to deliver important technologies and capabilities to address cognitive and cloud.
So now let me wrap up the segment discussion with the performance of software across our segments. Our total software revenue was $5.7 billion, up 3%. This is the third consecutive quarter of improvement in our software revenue growth trajectory.
We've got a broad software portfolio from solutions that provide cognitive, analytics and security solutions to core transaction processing, to connecting on-prem data and processes to private and public cloud environment, our software is open, running on IBM and non-IBM environments.
From a business area perspective this quarter, we had solid growth in cognitive solutions and integration software, while operating systems continue to be a drag in line with a longer term secular trend, across software, software annuity revenue was up mid single digits led by our SAS offerings.
Acquisitions contributed to our SAS growth, but SAS was up organically as well. Our transaction revenue decline mid-single digits which is a significant improvement in the trajectory as compared to the last several quarters, as its typically in the third quarter our transactional software content was less than 20% of our software revenue, but remember in the fourth quarter due to seasonality transactions represent a larger portion of the software revenue.
Moving on cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated $3.3 billion in cash from operations excluding our financing receivables. After $850 million of CapEx spend, we generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.
Through the first three quarters of the year, our free cash of $6.9 billion was a little lower than last year with lower tax payments largely offsetting the year to year operational performance. Through September our CapEx spending is consistent with last year.
As I mentioned earlier on a trailing 12 months basis our free cash flow was over 100% of our GAAP net income. This performance continues to support our expectation that we will deliver the high end of the full year free cash flow guidance range we provided earlier this years.
This includes the expected cash payments related to workforce rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year, as well as the expected tax payments in the fourth quarter. Looking at the uses of cash, so far this year we've invested nearly $5.5 billion in acquisitions.
We've acquired 12 companies, the largest being the digital assets of the Weather Company and Truven Health Analytics. In the last nine months we've return $6.6 billion shareholders including nearly $4 billion in dividends and we bought back almost 18 million shares. We ended September with just over 950 million shares outstand and $3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended September with $10 billion in cash and $42.5 billion in total debt, about $26 billion of our debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at about 7:1 and the portfolio remains strong at 51% investment grade.
Our non-financing debt to cap was about 54.5% which is essentially unchanged from December and down about four points from year ago. Our balance sheet continues to be well-positioned to support our business over the long term.
As I said upfront in an environment where there are lot of open questions our business is showing a lot of stability, that stability is driven by the kind of work we do for our clients. We're applying deep industry skills and innovative technologies to change real business processes and outcomes. This supports our ability to invest, to create new offerings in markets and our ability to find new ways to monetize our intellectual property.
In the third quarter, we made progress across our business with continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives, some moderation and declines in our core businesses, remixing our skills and adding new capabilities through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships.
You'll recall in July we said that we expected our second half EPS dynamics to be improved over the first and we laid out a half a dozen or so areas where we expected to drive that. Now based on our third quarter performance and view with the fourth we'd say the second half improvement is pretty much in line with our view 90 days ago.
While we may see a little less improvement from software revenue mix, we're more successful in monetizing our software through IP income. So bringing it all together and as we look at the full year we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.50 of operating EPS and free cash flow at the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year.
And so with that, we'll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I'd ask you to reframe from multi-part question. So let's please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may proceed with your question.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes. Thank you. Martin, I have hopefully straightforward clarification and then a question please. Just on the clarification the year-over-year IP gains were about $340 million or $0.30. And I appreciate that your licensing real software IP to get that, but how do we think about this has been sort of more one off rather than ongoing IP and should we be thinking of IP income increasing on an ongoing basis?
And similar, if you could just clarify the tax rate, I had 14:2 [ph] as your tax rate. You talked about two points being helped from a discrete tax item. Was there something else that was impacting the tax rate that appear to get it down to at least by my model something that's closer to 14%. So if you could clarify those two that would help.
And then the question is around free cash flow and how to think about it. This year you're going to be at the very high end into your range, probably free cash being a 100% or more than a 100% of GAAP net income. As we look forward next year given your guidance, is typically lower than that. Should we not be thinking about free cash flow declining in an absolute -- on an absolute basis in 2017?
Martin Schroeter
Okay. Well, I think I got them all, Toni. So, we'll do the clarifications first and we won't count that as a multi-part question, we'll count that as a multi-part clarification, and then we'll talk about free cash flow. So couple of things on IP and this is actually a really important point I think Toni, our IP income, our IP income has been flat to down over the last say three, four, five years and we've been thinking about how do we continue to drive IP income?
If you look back, and I'm sure you have all the data as well. If you back 15 years ago, we had as much as a $1.07 billion of IP income, now a lot of that was driven from the fact that we developed really good semiconductor manufacturers and really good semiconductor manufacturer processing technology and our ability to license that technology drove a lot of income. We have been thinking about how do we reinvigorate if you will the IP income business and part of it is what you'll see now as we're realizing some of these.
So, the clarification that you asked about, is it about 340 million year to year? Yes, that's right. That's about 340 million year to year. But more importantly, we are going to continue to drive IP income. Now, we got a good third quarter on a year to-date basis where about 1.01 billion, so we're kind of flat. I don't think that we have enough to set a new annual record when we look back at the $1.7 billion that we printed 15 years ago or so, but it is certainly a focus, and keep in mind I think that these are relationships, they are long term relationships, right. So, they are not all public as some of our partners don't want to talk about what they are doing. Those that our public, though their multi, multi year relationship where they can drive now some of the value that they see, they can capture within the marketplace.
We again, we license it to them, we don't sell it to them, so we have an interest going forward as well and can get some of the upside here. So this is a really -- it’s a terrific model, it's got a lot of legs. We see an opportunity for this over the next few years to continue doing this. So, I think that handles your clarification on tax. There are two points, your notes were right, two points were from the discrete piece of its. And then we are -- our view of the year now, because of the mix of our business has an operating ongoing effective rate of 18 plus or minus, which is where we were at the beginning of the year.
So, it's really a kind of a view of where the mix of our businesses looks for the rest of this year. On free cash flow your question, we have been running at a realization which is above our model. Now keep in mind we got – we won a tax case earlier in the year and that means we got our money back, right. So that was a pretty substantial inflow. But we also had some pretty substantial outflows in terms of our workforce rebalancing payments and things through the year. So, as we said in our guidance, we would expect to finish at the high of the guidance. We said that already 180 days ago. We still feel confident about our ability to generate cash.
As we start to look at next year, we don't see anything that fundamentally changes our realization from where we are in our model, so our model as you know is in the 90, so somewhere between 90% and 100% realization, and we don't see anything, knowing again everything we have now, everything we have now year to-date plus what's coming in the fourth, we don't see anything that would say our free cash flow realization is going to change. And so, when we get through now the fourth and we see where we are for 2017 and 90 days then we'll talk more about the absolutes, but we don't see anything in the realization that's going to drive our realization to be anything other than again 90% to 100% for next year.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
And our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Kathryn Huberty
Thanks. Good afternoon. You didn't close any major acquisitions this quarter and yet cognitive growth margin sell 400 basis points year on year, 200 basis points sequentially. Should we not expect to see improving margins as-a-service revenue scale on the fixed cost base of data centers? And then Martin just connected to that you mentioned that the one variance to your plan for the year is that the software business, margins are tracking the plan, can you maybe touch on why that it is? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. So, I'll address actually the second one first, Katy, so when we talked about first half to second half and we laid out where saw the business in the second half, one of those elements we had on that chart last quarter was the idea of software mix and as-a-service -- software mix and as-a-service margins and it would go – it would turn into a modest positive. And I would say that's more neutral now. So not a dramatic change and it really has to do with the mix of business, you know, we're getting the kind of growth rates we would expect. You saw third quarter we had software up 3, which is an acceleration from the prior quarter, but it really is that we're also seeing good momentum in our cloud platforms business, so it’s really a mix statement that is driving that as oppose to something happening within our software margins.
On the cognitive margin component the phenomena you described is absolutely accurate. As we slowdown those investments we'll see the as-a-service margin scale, we're starting to see the as-a-service business scale, but we still see so much opportunity we're going to keep driving the investments. And so we haven't gone to that point yet where the scale overtakes the investment levels in that as-a-service business.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Tien-tsin Huang
Great, thanks. Good afternoon. Just on the transactional sales down 5% in the third quarter, curious if there's any the line of sight here into this fourth quarter and what you might expect there in relationship to – in relation to which is on the third quarter maybe this is a question. Do we start to think about transactional sales and for the IP income, maybe together, I don't know if there is any correlation between the two in any way? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Tien-tsin, so a couple of things. The transactional business as we noted in the third, down five was an improvement from where we were in the second. So, we had reasonable transaction closing rates. Now, the thing to keep in mind as we go into the fourth, it is a much bigger transactional quarter for us and so while we have, what I would call a good opportunity pipeline, we have got now 85 days or a 75 days to see how the environment holds up and that will obviously drive the fourth quarter and drive the full year.
When we look at – when I look at the revenue streams in the fourth, our annuity business which again smaller pieces in the fourth. Our annuity business has been growing pretty consistently quarter, to quarter, to quarter and I would expect that growth to continue into the fourth that transactional business which is again much larger tends to get a pretty good quarter to quarter sequential bump if you will about $1.5 billion. And based on our opportunity pull, we'd say that looks about like what we'll get done in the fourth as well, but there is some uncertainty in environment and here in the U.S. we've got an election to get through, but right now I'd say that my line of sight into 4Q says, that quarter to quarter impact in third to fourth is about $2.5 billion as we had – just for that transactional business.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Tien-tsin. Sam, can we can take the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is open.
Steve Milunovich
Thank you. You talked quite bit about Watson. You've been running many Watson ads. I just wonder if you can give any updates from the Analyst Day on Watson. How much revenue are you generating? The revenue you do generate is it in the software or consulting buckets kind of relatively speaking that you expect going forward? You mentioned I think four, five ways, you're looking to monetize Watson at that meeting, I guess which ones are working. And you talked about it as a platform as well and I'm wondered if you consider running Watson on someone else's platform like on AWS?
Martin Schroeter
Okay. Steve, I'll start with the last question first and last answer to that question is no, Watson runs on our cloud and our technology and Watson will run on the IBM cloud. With regard to the progress we're seeing, we've talked a bit about and you've seen many of our announcement around where Watson is showing up and the kind of work it’s doing, all of that as you know gets reported within our strategic imperatives and all of it goes into the cognitive solutions space that's where our Watson Health business is, that's where our IoT business is, and that’s where the Watson platform is.
So, I'd say that with the cognitive solutions business we talked about it in total at plus five, the sub-segment of that where the Watson content shows up which we also provide is up eight, so good growth in that software solutions space. But keep in mind that we're also building new markets here and it's going to take some time for us to take the technologies and the processes that we bought for instant in our Watson Health business and now layer on the Watson technologies to get the ramp in growth that we expect to get out of some of them. So, yes, good progress, yes, it’s a long term investment, and all within that cognitive solutions segment and no, it's not going to run on anything but the IBM cloud.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is open.
Patricia Murphy
Lou, we can't hear you. You are on mute.
Lou Miscioscia
Hello.
Martin Schroeter
Well, there you are. Now we can hear you.
Lou Miscioscia
Okay. I hope it’s coming through okay. So on the software area which was up 3%, maybe can you go in there and just share with us what is organic, and would you say that we've actually gotten passed with flexible pricing situation that you've been obviously dealing with from negative growth standpoint for a couple of quarters or actually maybe about two years now?
Martin Schroeter
So, a couple of things, Lou on organic, as you said software up 3 and acceleration for where this -- there is across IBM, the acquisition impact was about the same as it was last quarter, about 2 points across all of the businesses. Now lot of those businesses are software, so obviously an impact in software in the quarter, but not dramatically different again from what we saw in the second. We have – we continue to have good annuity content performance, so our annuity business continues to grow.
The phenomena that we've talked about with regard to our largest customers is still part of the discussion with every large customer, it’s a question of how do they best view the deployment of their licenses. How do they best view the use of our technologies in order to make sure they are optimizing their own workloads, they make sure they are optimizing the projects they have going on.
One of the things and important thing to us is are they, to make sure that they're still using our software and are they still – are they still, for instance, paying us in [Indiscernible] and are they renewing that, and our renewal rates have stayed very high and very consistent through the third quarter as well, and so we're confident that our software business has the right appeal if you will to our clients, because they continue to use it, they continue to deploy it on any large customer basis, any large customer, the discussion could be a little bit different, but again good software performance in the quarter, some benefit from acquisitions, but I would expect that our annuity base will continue to keep growing as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Lou. Sam, can we go to next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. I have a quick clarification and a question as well. So, Martin when you alluded to sort of moving into this high transactional quarter in the fourth quarter, I think you alluded to about 2.5 billion sequential improvement quarter on quarter in that business, is that the baseline that is needed to achieve the 2013 and 2015 in guidance, that's my clarification. And for my question, if you think about sort of the unique one-time benefits in 2016 you had tax which was the big driver for first quarter. I know you had associated investments and then now you look at the third quarter there are some significant IP other income and I appreciate your comments around the increasing nature and sustainability of this.
And I know you're not guiding it to 2017, but conceptually these elements make it seemingly tougher to grow earnings in 2017 especially at a time when base of buybacks are moderating at sub 1 billion for the last four quarters and gross margins continue to compress, so maybe you can help us taking through at a high level maybe some puts and takes and what potentially will be positive drivers are offsetting some of these headwinds in 2017?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Wamsi, and again the multi-part clarification with the question is an interesting approach, but – so first on the revenue quarter to quarter, yes, so when we look at our third to fourth as I said, we typically get about $2.5 billion in transactional revenue in the quarter and that's sort of build in one-off, I mean, we got a different – we have a lot of different scenarios on what the year might look like, but that is certainly the predominant if you will scenario on how the fourth comes in.
On the view of 2017 which I'll come back to you in moment, again, I know you – and you said it I think, you did listen to my answer on IP, but this is not a onetime thing, right again, IBM has had as much as $1.07 billion of IP in our income statement, it is one of ways we monetize all of our intellectual property, it’s only one, right, we also obviously sell a lot too, but we license their IP is part of our business model. I don't think about it is one-time. We're going to continue to drive this and hopefully grow it. We've got a reasonable pull in the fourth of clients and partners who want to license our technology, so you shouldn't think of it is one-time at all.
Now, as we go into 2017, with our big transactional quarter coming up obviously and 90 days we'll talk about what we saw in the environment and what that position us for 2017, but I do think we know, we know a few things as we head into next year already today, so we know for instance we've got good momentum in our strategic imperatives and we continue to see with our investments and our view of the market, how that resonates with clients and I think we would expect to continue to see good strategic imperatives performance which also by the way will drive some investments but keep in mind that with everything we got done this year, the bulk of the spending, the bulk of the investment dollars we freed up next year, that's a much bigger number next year, so we have a freedom and an ability to invest more heavily given what we've got and done so far this year. So that's one thing we know.
Secondly, we're seeing good sign ins and backlog performance in our GTS business, that was sign-ins and backlog up again and within that GTS business, the biggest part of that our infrastructure services business which drives by the way that backlog also expanded margins in the quarter, so that's a big deal for us obviously. We also saw expanding margins in our – in parts of our GBS business and our application management business, again as we drive productivity. So, we know again good performance and momentum in strategic imperatives.
We have good sign-ins and backlog growth in our GTS business with margin expansion in some of services businesses. And then at this point we'll see where currency winds up in the next 75 days. At this point, it’s kind of neutral shift you will, it certainly not the billion plus impact we took this year as we wrapped on all the hedging from last year, so its far more neutral next year. Now, at the same time as you said we don't another tax case that we're going to close next year, but at the same time most of that was reinvested if you will or consumes elsewhere, it didn't show up on the bottom line.
So, yet too soon to tell, we'll get through the fourth, we'll talk about the 90 days when we see, but there is some -- there's momentum here in parts of this business that we'll be spending more time on.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Wamsi. Can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.
David Grossman
Thank you. So, Martin, if we look at organic growth rate of the imperatives, it looks like that began decelerating in the fourth quarter of last year and through the second quarter of this year. And then they looks at least, if my math right, they bounce back this quarter, and you did a good job of telegraphing that last year's growth was not sustainable. That said, the number are seems to be a little bit more volatile than expected. Is there any way you can help us parse this disclosure and just help us better understand what drove the deceleration and then what drove the subsequent rebound this quarter?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. I think the best thing to do, David, is to look at all of this on a trailing 12 months basis. You know, we recently started giving this on a quarterly basis. It’s a good disclosure and the sense that everyone ask for it and we try to provide the components of our strategic imperatives within each of our new segments. And I think in general people appreciated having that level of detail, but to your point, if you're looking for my advice and how best to interpret this I had interpreted on a 12 months trailing basis.
Our clients aren't making big, big investment decisions like who do I trust with my data and what cloud am I going to move on to? That's a decision that is going to last much longer than say, a 90 day reporting cycle. So, in any given reporting cycle there will be volatility. My advice look at it on a trailing 12 months basis and you can see the trend.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO. Your line is open.
Keith Bachman
Hi. Thank you very much. I also want to ask about cognitive solutions, you mentioned that the rollout of SAS if you will or software service is impacting the margins, yet you had still a very small part of the total, it's perhaps 100% of the current revenue base. As that ramp what that continue to place pressure on your margin structure? Or to say it different way, could you characterize that we look at 2017 would margins and cognitive solutions be at a minimum flattish. How are you thinking about that? And one clarification also just, did you mentioned what the total revenues in organic sources were or was M&A about two points I hope this quarter as well?
Martin Schroeter
Yes. So in total Keith, our acquisitions contributed about two points a growth, same as second quarter.
Keith Bachman
Okay. Yes.
Martin Schroeter
So, on our cognitive solutions and our margins, so first keep in mind, this is our highest margin business, it is primarily software and within that it's got very heavy high value content in the on-premise category if you will, right. And so these margins which are very high, we want to and we're moving some of this business and investing in the as-a-service, so as that moves into the margin profile, the cognitive solutions could it see a little bit of margin pressure over the long term. Yes, but it’s coming from a very, very high base.
And as-a-service component that's going in, it still better margin than all of the other segments in general. So, yes, the as-a-service component of cognitive solutions may have a bit of an impact just on that segment but overall it will still help IBM and again this is a very, very high margin segment at north of 80% here so. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Keith. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from James [Indiscernible] with SPE [ph]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you very much. And Martin thanks for the explanation about the additional investments you're doing that impacts gross margin. Can you help us understand incrementally going forward, so not say, year-over-year but kind of incrementally going forward, the efforts you been doing kind of this year. Should we expect the same type or incrementally do you feel like you're going to have to incrementally do more investments forward or just kind of at this level? Thank you very much.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Jim. I'd say that given, yes, we'll continue to invest. Do I think the rate of growth of investment has to continue? Well, the short answer is it may, but again remember how much we got done this year in terms of making room in the overall IBM equation and the productivity we are driving in parts of our services businesses, I know that we are seeing margin expansion in some of those.
So yes, we will continue to invest and infact I think that some of these markets require this level or the markets require this level of investment in order to be at the leading edge with our clients, but we do make a lot more room if you will in the overall IBM equation given everything we got done this year. And we’ll spend more time in 90 days on how all of that plays out for 2017, but again we made a lot of room for investments for ourselves for next year.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you. Can we please take one last question?
Operator
Thank you. And our last question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks. [Indiscernible] I’ll keep to one clarification and one question up. I guess you know the question really is when I look at your free cash flow usage over the last four quarters; it’s been you know more skewed towards acquisition versus what one would have thought in the past. As you look at 2017, do you think it optimizes more i.e. buybacks to be much more than you know the $1billion run rate you guys are running at and acquisitions could be small, just help us on this on the mix as you go forward. And then just to clarify when you talk about 90% to 100% conversion of net income to free cash flow in 2017 is that of a GAAP or non-GAAP number?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, sure I’ll do the clarification first Amit. So that’s our GAAP net income realization. We’ve just kept it consistent in terms of GAAP net income. It was the most straightforward for we think for everyone to understand. So the free cash flow realization data is GAAP net income.
On how free cash flow, skews next year and the application of our capital, I’d say first you know you can be assured that we are going to put all of our money to work as we have. We don’t tend to -- we don’t keep capital here to the extent its excess, after we’ve invested in organically and after we’ve purchased what we think we need through acquisitions and after we’ve paid the dividend we do return capital to shareholders.
Over the long term in the form of share repurchase, we over the long term as we said now pretty consistently, we think over the long term we can reduce our share count by 2% to 3% and that obviously recognizes that we will continue to be acquisitive. So, I would say that Amit what -- again we’ll talk more about what we have assumed when we get to 2017 but we will absolutely continue to invest organically, we’ll absolutely continue to be acquisitive. We’ll absolutely continue to grow the dividend and then to the extent that we have access capital to return we will return it on over the long term that number from a share repurchase would be a 2% to 3% reduction.
So, let me conclude, let me conclude by reminding you that we are running a highly differentiated play here. We are building obviously cognitive capabilities well beyond what others are doing with individual AI services if you will and we are building the platforms to help deliver that and we are making all of that available on another platform, the IBM cloud.
And it came up as you heard on the call, will Watson run on someone else’s cloud? No, it won’t, it will run on the IBM cloud. And we are doing all of that with deep industry expertise and that’s what our clients are looking for, that cognitive capability on the IBM cloud with deep industry expertise and you can see that in our health, you can see that in our IoT and you can see now in financial services which we just announced a couple of weeks ago.
So we are very excited about what we are doing and we are very excited about the businesses we are building and of course we are very excited with the help and what are allowing and enabling our clients to become which is cognitive businesses. So as we do that, we’ll continue to be deeply embedded in the fabric of how they run their businesses and the most important work they do. They trust us with their data, they trust us to be their partner and becoming cognitive businesses and quite frankly that’s how we make sure that we are successful over the long term. So thank you for joining our call today.
Patricia Murphy

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. In the second quarter, we generated $20.2 billion in revenue, $3.5 billion in pre-tax income and $2.95 of operating earnings per share.
Ninety days ago, we told you what we expected for the second quarter. We said we’d continue to see strength in the strategic imperatives and we delivered 12% revenue growth led by cloud. We said we’d continue to build as-a-service capabilities. Our cloud-as-a-service revenue was up 50% and we exited the quarter with an annual run rate of $6.7 billion in our cloud-as-a-service businesses. That’s up from $5.4 billion last quarter. Certainly we have a benefit from the acquisitions recently closed but we has solid organic growth as well.
We said we’d continue a high level of investment as we move into new areas and build new markets, and we did that both organically and through acquisitions. And we said that, given seasonality and actions we took in the first quarter, we’d grow our pre-tax income by about $2 billion quarter to quarter, and we grew a bit more than that. In total, we got done what we set out to do and we saw some improvements in trajectory relative to long-term trends, though, as always, the rate and pace varied by business unit and geography.
Let me touch quickly on some of the drivers for the quarter. As I said, we continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our strategic imperatives. Over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered $31 billion in revenue, and now represent 38% of IBM. Growth was led by cloud, where our revenue was up 30% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, and over $11.5 billion over the last year so good progress in cloud. Looking at revenue from a segment perspective, the strongest growth came from cognitive solutions led by our analytics and cognitive capabilities and security.
In technology services and cloud platforms, our infrastructure services revenue continues to grow while integration software declined as we shift those offerings to cloud. And our GTS backlog grew on the back of strong signings. Our systems business again reflects the product cycle dynamics in terms of revenue and margin. And Global Business Services continues to reflect a shift in our business. We’re continuing to deliver double-digit growth in the strategic areas led by mobile and cloud and our application management business is stable though pressure in the more traditional areas of consulting and some inconsistency in our execution continue to impact the GBS results.
As we shift IBM’s business overall, it’s important to understand that we’re not only moving them to new spaces but in fact creating entirely new markets. So as I said, we’re investing at a high level both by growing organic investment in areas like our Watson platform capabilities and our cloud data center capacity and getting acquisitions into our run rate. Our investments together with currency, product cycle dynamics, and the actions we took in the first quarter are reflected in our profit performance in the first half of this year. I’ll talk about how the second half plays out relative to the first later in the call as we continue to expect to deliver at least 13.50 of operating earnings per share for the year.
Let me spend a minute on what we’ve got done as we move into new areas and become a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. Clients are looking to become digital businesses and our cognitive solutions bring together digital business with digital intelligence to improve decision-making and add intelligence into all products and processes. For example, companies such as Kimberly-Clark, the ISS group, and sesame workshop announced in the second quarter they are working with IBM on innovative Internet of Things solutions for everything from facilities management to early childhood education.
Healthcare organizations such as the U.K.’s National Health Service, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the American Diabetes Association were among many in the quarter that announced they are leveraging Watson to create new approaches to treatment and patient care. And in the second quarter, we announced Watson for cyber security, a new cloud based version of our cognitive technology trained on the language of security. What these innovative client initiatives have in common is that they are industry-based cognitive solutions enabled by the IBM cloud and all of this is supporting the movement of our clients to hybrid environments.
This quarter, we extended our cloud innovations available on Bluemix including the first Apache Spark development environment for data scientists to more quickly and easily analyze big data. We delivered new IoT services using Bluemix OpenWhisk, our event driven programming model to speed development of IoT applications on the IBM cloud. We announced block chain agreements with banks such as Mizuho and Crédit Mutuel Arkéa and we opened a Bluemix garage in New York City to help financial services clients rapidly design, build, and pilot their own block chain solutions as well as other emerging fintech applications and services.
We leveraged recent acquisitions in Clearleap, Cleversafe and Ustream to announce new Video-on-Demand services deals with major brands such as Mazda, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Comic-Con. We also continue to partner with major IT industry players, leveraging IBM’s unique hybrid platform to grow and extend their own offerings and client migrations. For example, we announced that IBM cloud would be a strategic partner of Box Zones in Europe and Asia. Box Zones and the IBM cloud will uniquely enable clients to store and manage data across hybrid environments in the country of their choice and we expanded our global partnership with VMware to deliver desktop services in a security-rich environment on the IBM cloud.
We also announced a breakthrough in making quantum computing available on the IBM cloud. The IBM Quantum Experience is a great example of how cloud is making emerging technologies available that wouldn’t have been accessible in the past. This kind of open innovation will allow for the next stage of development in quantum information technology and help push a universal quantum computer to reality even faster. Now Quantum isn’t a new idea. Researchers have been working on it for a long time. But it’s a not niche either. On the day we announced it, it generated 138 million Twitter impressions and to give you a sense of that level of interest, it’s fewer than Andy Murray when he won Wimbledon. But it’s more than the impressions generated by Phil Mickelson’s record tying score in the first round of the Open last Thursday.
Since the launch in May, we already have active users in nearly 150 countries that have run more than 175,000 experiments through the IBM Quantum Experience. As we move into new areas, we’re also continuing to deliver innovation in the core. For example, in Infrastructure Services, we’re shifting from being a systems integrator to a services integrator, connecting and streamlining multiple environments and delivering as-a-service solutions to our clients. You see this in our recent engagements with Pratt & Whitney and Emirates.
To help systems innovation, this quarter we acquired EZSource to help developers quickly and easily update mainframe applications. And in software we entered into an agreement with a strategic partner to license the intellectual property of some of our assets within our core software portfolio to accelerate product innovation and extend the capabilities to hybrid cloud. I’ll expand on some of these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions. But first let me walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.
Our revenue for the quarter was $20.2 billion. While there was a lot of movement in individual currencies in total, currency translation had a 20 basis point impact to revenue growth. I’ll talk to our performance at constant currency. Our revenue is down 2.5%, and on a geographic basis Americas was down 2%. This was an improvement from last quarter’s rate across the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Europe was weaker, due primarily to Germany and Switzerland. And Asia Pacific was down about 2%. And with strong growth in India once again, and sequential improvement in all of the BRIC countries, the BRIC’s returned to growth. Our gross margin performance reflects higher levels of investment, especially in cognitive solutions and the fact that we’re building scale in our as-a-service businesses.
Looking at expense on a year-to-year basis, there are a few items to note. First is an increase in investment levels. We also have a higher level of IP income this quarter due primarily to the licensing partnership I just mentioned. And while not an impact to this year, we did have work force rebalancing charges last year as well as some gains that mitigated those charges. And finally, we have a year-to-year impact from currency as last year’s hedging gains roll off. In fact, at a PTI level, when you consider both the hedge and the translation impact, currency impacted profit growth by about $250 million.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 19% all in, at the higher end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year, which you will remember was 18% plus or minus a couple of points without discrete items. From a cash perspective we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and more than $13 billion over the last 12 months. This is over 100% of our GAAP net income, and over the same period we returned about 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and gross share purchases.
As we get into the segments, remember our strategy and point of view is that to be successful you need to bring together cognitive solutions to improve decision-making and outcomes, to approach that with an industry context and skills, and to enable that in a hybrid environment to get the agility of the cloud while leveraging the breadth of an enterprise data and processes. Now I’ll talk about how each of our segments plays a critical role in how we capture these opportunities.
Starting with our Cognitive Solutions segment where revenue growth accelerated to 4% in the second quarter. We had sequential improvement in both solutions software and transaction processing software. Our solutions software revenue was up 6% for the quarter. Our strong performance in SAS continued with double-digit growth in revenue. Growth was led by analytics and security, and acquisitions clearly provided lift.
Our Analytics business is the largest portion of the solutions software portfolio. Analytics grew in key areas including Cognos, information integration and big data, and of course Watson as we add to our capabilities. The Weather Company acquisition is off to a good start as we integrate it with Watson Technology.
In June, we introduced Watson Adds [ph], leveraging the weather platform, which delivers as many as 26 billion forecasts daily. Consumers will be able to interact with IBM Watson through advertising, by asking questions and receiving relevant product information. Campbell, Unilever and GSK Consumer Healthcare will be the first marketers to collaborate with The Weather Company on Watson Adds [ph].
Security had strong revenue growth and together with our Security Services we outpaced the market by 3X. Our momentum is driven by our unique market position. We have built an extensive security portfolio tailored to the needs of our clients for integrated security across their entire operations. As a result, we’re the number one enterprise security software and services provider and hold a leadership position in 12 of the 14 segments according to Forrester, IDC and Gartner.
This quarter we closed our Resilient acquisition, adding leading incident response technology and expertise to our portfolio. We had strong demand for our Guardian offerings as we saw clients moving to our database security offerings across a range of industries including Information Services and banking. And in May we announced Watson for cyber security, a new cognitive system we have been training and will make available in a beta program later this year for use by our customers. As part of this announcement, eight leading universities will also train Watson in the language of security.
We’re growing and broadening the reach of Watson with new capabilities, partnerships, and engagements to accelerate adoption. Clients across industries are expanding their Watson engagements, moving from pilot use cases in consulting engagements into long-term production. As an example, in the second quarter, design software leader Autodesk signed a multi-year production SAS agreement with Watson to leverage Watson Engagement Advisor. This engagement builds on the value and strong usage proven during the pilot to resolve customer inquiries. This is one demonstration of our focus on the core conversational service for client applications and the developer community.
We also introduced new offerings such as Watson Company Analyzer, which helps companies reduce the time and effort required to collect, digest, and synthesize information for building strategic business relationships and understanding competitive market spaces. And in Watson Health, we continue to capitalize on our differentiated ability to understand, reason, and learn with industry specialization.
We launched Watson Care Manager, which provides structured programs and tools to support care coordinators in delivering care to patients. This offering enables patients to avoid rehospitalization. In the second quarter, we extended partnerships with the American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association, which are examples of the strong support and momentum Watson Health has with leading clinical and research communities. And at the White House Cancer Moon Shot Summit, we made a commitment to utilize our cognitive solutions to help doctors offer personalized care to 10,000 veterans fighting cancer.
We’re working with Teva, a large pharmaceuticals client to improve drug efficacy for millions of patients with complex and chronic diseases by leveraging the IBM Watson Health cloud solution. We formed a medical imaging collaborative with 15 industry leaders to put Watson to work extracting insights from invisible unstructured imaging data. And in April, we closed the Truven acquisition. The data and insights from Truven will be integrated into our Watson Health cloud.
So now looking at the profit results for the segment. Gross margin was down largely driven by mix shift to SAS and higher investments including acquisition content. Pre-tax income performance continues to reflect our higher level of investment and strategic growth areas like Watson platform, Health, and IoT again this quarter. Global Business Services delivered $4.3 billion of revenue. Our performance was similar to recent quarters with continued growth in our strategic imperatives, offset by declines in the more traditional consulting areas.
We saw double digit growth in our digital practices around cloud, analytics, mobility, security, and cognitive. And we continue to aggressively shift resources and investments to drive these businesses.
Our GBS team leads the industry mission for IBM as we have amassed over 100,000 industry resources. Our consultants build strategies that help our clients gain new insights on data and launch new business models for competitive advantage. We’re scaling the industry’s first cognitive consulting practice which draws on the expertise of more than 2,000 consulting professionals spanning machine learning, advanced analytics, data science, and development.
We continue to ramp the IBM interactive experience. We have opened over 30 digital studios around the globe including new studios in Singapore and Seoul. We also completed the acquisition of Aperto, a digital agency in Berlin with over 300 employees and a roster of enterprise clients such as Airbus and Siemens. We’re shifting away from traditional on premise ERP to cloud-based application management and consulting. We closed on the acquisition of Bluewolf this quarter, a top sales force partner and recognized leader in cloud consulting and implementation services.
We’re also growing our services on workday applications, leveraging the skills we brought on through our Meteorix acquisition last year. Overall, we delivered 60% growth in our cloud practice this quarter. Application Management remains stable as clients look to us to manage the lifecycle of their applications, and bring new applications to market faster through digital cloud platforms.
Turning to profit. GBS gross profit and PTI margins were down year-to-year. These margin declines reflect the investments we’re making in our digital practices as well as some issues in our execution. And in some of the traditional service areas that are not as differentiated, we’re seeing price and profit pressure. We continue to invest and shift resources to our higher value services around digital and cognitive.
We’re also taking actions to improve our delivery efficiency and execution while remaining focused on our commitment to our clients’ success.
Technology services and cloud platforms delivered nearly $9 billion of revenue with growth in infrastructure services offset by declines in technical support services and integration software. Across the segment, our strategic imperatives were also up strong double digits. We had strong signings performance in GTS and the backlog for the segment continued to grow.
We saw continued momentum in infrastructure services as clients turned to us to optimize their IT environments and move them to cloud. We again had strong growth in the IBM cloud. Our point of view is that clients can unlock the most value for their businesses by moving to hybrid cloud infrastructures which provide agility and enable new business models while at the same time tie back to their core systems of record. We always said that hybrid capabilities are critical for an enterprise grade cloud and we continue to lead in a rapidly growing hybrid cloud market. We’re shifting from systems integration to services integration as we connect multiple environments and build out hybrid infrastructures, delivered as a service to the client.
Our as-a-service revenue for the segment was up over 50% for the quarter. We continue to sign transformative agreements with clients to optimize their infrastructure and help digitize their operations. At Pratt & Whitney, we’ll move their business, manufacturing, and engineering enterprise systems to a fully managed environment on the IBM cloud. They’re expecting to double their engine production by 2020 and we’ll provide them with the means to manage, analyze, and grow their infrastructure dramatically to accommodate the company’s growth.
And this quarter, we signed a seven-year $1.3 billion agreement with CSC to expand our cloud partnership and build a secure scaleable and flexible mainframe infrastructure that will enable CSC to economically scale up and down demand to address current and future client needs and reduce its capital outlays. This builds on announcement earlier this year that integrated Bluemix into their cloud management platform. Bluemix provides our clients with speed and agility in launching new business models and applications in the cloud. And along with the rest of the integration software portfolio, it’s at the heart of our hybrid cloud strategy. Overall, integration software revenue declined.
From a product perspective we had continued strength in our connect products as clients integrate applications, data, and processes for both on-prem and cloud-based acquisitions. Across integration software, our annuity content is growing and we accelerate the shift to an as-of-service consumption model through new cloud capabilities delivered on our Bluemix cloud platform. For example, this year Kaiser Permanente began its move to the IBM cloud and Bluemix as the strategic platform for their transformation to a more agile data driven organization engaging with millions of individual members and patients. This will allow them to take advantage of new technologies, existing data and back end systems in a hybrid model.
Turning to profit, our gross profit was down year-to-year driven by the mix of businesses within the segment. Our PTI margin also reflects this business mix impact as well as the investments we’re making to build out our cloud platforms. Additionally, this quarter we entered into an agreement with one of our strategic business partners where we will license the intellectual property of select assets within the integration software portfolio while jointly going to market to ensure our clients’ success. This will shift our spending profile for these assets to a more variable cost structure anything forward.
Systems revenue was down consistent with the cycle. Our systems hardware revenue was down 28%. Operating system software revenue was down 4% this quarter, which is a modest sequential improvement in year-to-year performance but as we said, we expect operating systems to continue to be a drag on growth. Revenues for our z Systems declined 40% in the second quarter while margins improved, consistent with where we are in the product cycle. We’re continuing to expand the z client base adding 13 new clients in the quarter and nearly 70 since the beginning of the cycle. We had had our first major z13 win in China this quarter with a large Chinese bank migrating its mainframe install base to our latest technology. We’re continuing to drive innovation in the z Systems platform. 
As I mentioned earlier, we acquired EZSource, which will help our clients modify applications for their digital transformation while also supporting agility and hybrid cloud. Our revenue was down in the second quarter with growth in the mid-range offset by declines in the high and the low end. The UNIX market is a high value space that’s been declining and we represent the majority of the market. Our performance here reflects the replacement dynamic, following strong performance in the high end of POWER8 in the second quarter of last year. While the midrange has been growing year-to-year, we will see a similar replacement dynamic in the third quarter as we ramp on the midrange POWER8 introduction.
We’re also addressing the growing Linux market, and this quarter we grew year to year and quarter to quarter with our Linux on Power strategy. It is becoming a more meaningful part of our business with over 10% of our POWER revenue in the second quarter. We have seen particular success with Hanna [ph], a play that we started a year ago. We will expand the Linux-only portfolio by leveraging OpenPOWER, we plan to bring two new servers supporting cloud-enabled big data and cognitive applications to our portfolio and release our second generation HPC [ph] server with POWER8 processors connected to an Nvidia GPU acceleration.
Turning to Storage, as we said in the past, storage value is shifting to software, which is reported in our Cognitive Solutions segment. In Storage Software, we’re continuing to grow software-defined storage, which includes object storage and our newly introduced Spectrum suite offerings. Storage hardware revenue decreased 13%, which continues to reflect weakness in the traditional disc storage market. We released the new all flash DSAK [ph] storage offering during the second quarter, giving us competitive differentiation with plans to deliver all flash offerings across the entire portfolio.
Our Systems gross profit and pre-tax income declined, reflecting the revenue performance. Our Systems gross profit margin was flat with margin improvements in both z Systems and POWER, offset by lower storage margins and the impact of mix.
So now after going through the segments, I want to address the performance of software across our segments. Our total software revenue was up 1%, driven by an acceleration in the annuity content. Subscription and support revenue was up reflecting increased deployment by our clients and steady renewal rates. And the investments in new areas are paying off with growth in SAS. Acquisitions contributed to that growth, and we also grew our annuity base on an organic basis. I will remind you that while the SAS acquisitions add to the top line, they’re a drag to profit in the first year.
Looking at the annuity growth by business area, we had strong growth in cognitive solutions as well as integration software, while the annuity content in operating systems declined.
Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet, we generated $3.1 billion of cash from operations excluding our financing receivables. After a billion investment in CapEx, we generated $2.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. For the first half, free cash flow of nearly $4.5 billion is essentially flat year to year, with lower cash taxes offsetting the year-to-year operational performance. These first half results support our expectation that we will deliver the high end of the full-year free cash flow guidance range we provided earlier this year. This takes into account the cash payments related to the work force rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year as well as the timing of tax payments in the second half.
Looking at the uses of cash in the first half, we have invested $5.4 billion in acquisitions. So far this year, we have acquired 11 businesses, including Truven Health Analytics and the digital assets of The Weather Company. In the last six months we have returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, including $2.6 billion in dividends. In April, we again raised our dividend, and with that we’ve now doubled our dividend per share since 2010. In the first half, we bought back over 12 million shares and we ended June with 956 million shares outstanding and 3.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Moving to the balance sheet, we ended June with $10.6 billion in cash. Our total debt was about $44.5 billion of which $26.5 billion was in support of our Financing business. The leverage in our Financing business remains at seven-to-one, and the portfolio remains strong at 52% investment grade. You can see more on this topic in our supplemental material in the backup.
Our non-financing debt was 18 billion, and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 59%. The increase in both reflect the timing of our debt issuances relative to maturities this year. Our balance sheet continues to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long-term.
So now let me wrap up and talk about our view of the second half and put it in context of the first half performance. We thought we’d lay it out on a slide for you. You’ll recall in the first quarter we took significant actions to transform our workforce and change the way we work, resulting in significant workforce rebalancing and real estate charges. As we said, this is about rebalancing skills more than capacity reduction, and so these actions free up spend that can be reinvested to build capabilities as well as contributing to the bottom line. We’ve started to see some savings already, but the majority of the growth savings we’ll see in 2016 will come in the fourth quarter. We mapped all of that out in our last call, and we’re right on track.
As expected, our mainframe product cycle also had an impact to our EPS growth in the first half. As we enter the second half, our mainframe compares will get easier. In fact, we expect mainframe to be fairly neutral to EPS growth. Over the last 12 months, we have been investing at a high level both organically and through acquisitions, as we build cognitive and cloud capabilities. The organic investments had a mid-single digit impact on our EPS growth. As we wrap on the higher level of spend in the back half of last year, this will have less of an impact on EPS growth over the next two quarters.
We’ve completed 20 acquisitions over the last year. The acquired content is contributing to our top line and will continue to do so in the second half because these are primarily as-a-service capabilities and require additional investment as we create new spaces, they have a return profile with a longer payback. The acquisitions we’ve completed to date had a low-single digit impact to our EPS growth rate in the first half. They’ll continue to be dilutive in the second half, though at a lower level. Many of these new capabilities are delivered as a service. As these ramp, it’ll benefit our second half relative to the first, not only from a software mix perspective, but adding scale will also help our margins.
And of course, we’ve talked about the impact of currency on our profit growth in 2016, due primarily to the roll-off of last year’s hedging gains. We can’t predict where currently will go from here, but at current spot rates the impact from currency will moderate in the second half due to year-to-year hedging dynamics and a slightly better translational environment. And finally, you’ll recall we had a significant discrete tax benefit in the first quarter. Relative to the ongoing effective tax rate, we continue to expect to be in the range we provided at the beginning of the year. Put it all together, and we expect our second half EPS dynamics to be significantly improved over the first and continue to expect to deliver at least $13.50 of operating EPS for the year.
So with that financial context to our second half from a business perspective, we’ll continue to focus on using cognitive to help clients get value from their data, to improve decision-making and outcomes, moving our clients to hybrid cloud environments and with a strong industry dimension. As we do that, we’re moving into new spaces and, in some cases, creating entirely new markets. We’ll continue to shift our business toward our strategic imperatives, with strong growth in our as-a-service offerings and continued growth in software. And we’ll continue to invest to add capabilities and to deliver innovation across the business, all while returning value to shareholders.
And so with that, we’ll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty
Thanks. Good afternoon. You didn’t mention the UK in your commentary around EMEA. How did the headlines around Brexit impact the month of June? And did it have any impact on not raising the full-year outlook despite beats in the first and second quarter? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Katie. Thank you. So we certainly – I don’t think that Brexit coming at the end of the quarter helped us at all, but we obviously finished kind of right where we expected to finish. And when we look at our full view of the year, we don’t see an impact, if you will, that has any real materiality on us. And that’s why we continue to hold our operating EPS. So it certainly didn’t help but, again, no – nothing that said we should change our operating EPS for the year. What I typically observe in these kinds of instances is that our discussions with our clients have to go through a process of reprioritization, if you will. And remember, the extent of the discussions we have with our clients is about their most important processes.
So as they reprioritize, the length of time that takes depends a lot on how much uncertainty they’re faced with. And obviously, the political leadership in Europe and the UK can help reduce that uncertainty, but we didn’t see – again, we don’t think it helped but it didn’t cause us to change our guidance.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katie. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes. Thank you. Martin, I estimate that software acquisitions helped about $350 million to $400 million in terms of the revenue impact year-over-year. And if that’s the case, then company revenues declined about 4% or a bit more and software revenues declined about 5% or a bit more. I was hoping you could clarify if those numbers are correct, because if they are, it actually suggests that both company revenue and software revenue decelerated from Q1 even though the compare was actually a bit easier. So I was wondering if you could address this notion of what appeared to be some deceleration in the business on an organic basis.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Tony. A couple of things. First, the acquisitions are part of IBM, so when you say company revenue, I think of the total as kind of company revenue. Within the total, as we’ve talked about, we did at Investor Day and I think this is generally true, given the volume of acquisitions we do, we generally over the long term see about a point help. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we got about twice that. We got about two points of help in total. Now, that’s not all software obviously. Also as you know, we’ve been acquiring some businesses for our GBS business. So on an acquisitive impact across IBM, it was about two points.
What we saw in software in the second quarter, I would describe the dynamic as very similar to what we’ve seen over the past few quarters, which is we – in our largest clients, we see continued deployment, and therefore we continue to grow the annuity base in those large clients. And outside those large clients we continue to see growth in total. And then, again, the transactional business, which tends to have an out-sized impact in the second and the fourth quarter because of our mix of revenue – of transactional versus annuity also plays into this when you start looking at it sequentially because they’re not fully comparable, if you will. The mix is a bit different. So acquisitions clearly a benefit to us. About two points, as I said, in total, a mix of software and services. And a set of software dynamics underneath that that suggest to us continued deployment, continued growth in the annuity base, and still some transactional growth pressure, if you will, in some of our largest clients.
A – Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tony. Rowena [ph], can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMC. You may ask your question.
Tien-tsin Huang
Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just on the services side, I saw that signings were up nicely. Anything unusual there? And can we see an eventual pull-through there with consulting maybe following behind it? And, Martin, you did mention some inconsistency on execution I think a couple times. Can you elaborate on that? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Tien-tsin. Thanks. So we did have pretty good signings, and that signings kept the backlog in total flat year to year. What we’re seeing in the marketplace, if I start to disaggregate between GTS and GBS for a moment, we continue to see very strong growth in GTS. You saw that in the signings numbers and you see that in the growing backlog. And that profile, if you will, of what we’re working on for our clients is very consistent with what we’ve talked about in the past, which is our clients are looking to move to hybrid clouds. Our clients are looking for us to help them develop and deploy and run some of the latest technologies such as mobile. So that trend continues. The size of those deals continues to be quite substantial. Not every deal is a big deal, but we haven’t seen any reduction certainly in deal sizes. In fact, we’ve had some of the biggest deals – some of the volume of biggest deals that we’ve seen over the past few years continue in the GTS business.
And when we look forward at that GTS relationship, if you will, in over the last, call it, 10 quarters, over two and a half years or so, we’ve had pretty good consistent book-to-bill greater than one. So the booking rates, as you know, are the signings we report. And then on the billing side, in GPS you have our maintenance business as well. And so obviously that doesn’t go into the bookings side of the equation. So you’ve got to do the math right but book-to-bill in GTS has been over the last 10 quarters very consistent. Again, reflects, I think, the strong value we bring to clients.
On the consulting side in GBS, we did have a good signings quarter. There is plenty of business out there and we see good uptake of our most advanced offerings, if you will, those that help digitize our clients. We continue to pull back on that enterprise kind of wide application installation. When we say pull back, by the way, that means we’re moving resource and we moved again more than a third of our resource out of that part of the business. So it’s not a surprise that that part of the business is declining. So the consulting opportunity is certainly there. When we talk about execution, when I talk about execution issues, I guess the way I’d say it is, look, we – we take on our industry skills, take on some pretty complex projects for our clients, and sometimes we have to spend a bit more money than we would have thought in order to make it all working properly and making sure our clients are satisfied. So that’s on us. That’s on execution. The teams, you know, they’ll work through these things but I wouldn’t call it – I wouldn’t call it widespread.
A – Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tien-tsin. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Apelo [ph] with JMP Securities. You may ask your question.
Q – Unidentified Analyst
Great. Thank you very much. Martin, one quick question I wanted to ask about the EPS trajectory in the second half. And I know you reiterated at least 13.50 in EPS. But in light of the macro headlines, I was wondering if you’re thinking about weighing Q3 and Q4 any differently in the second half of the year. Thanks.
A – Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Greg. Sure. So we included a pretty detailed chart, I think, on some of the first half to second half trajectory changes. And I think the one point to make kind of across the board on that chart is that everything there, it gets either the same or better in the fourth. And so when we look at all of the impacts as an example, you know, we’ve got the chart that shows as-a-service scale helping and a chart that shows the actions we took in the first quarter helping in the second quarter. All of those have a bigger impact in the fourth than they do in the third. And the rest do as well, but those are just, again, two examples.
So I guess the way I think about third versus fourth in a total perspective, you know, in total third quarter for us tends to be in a fairly tight range. You know, our annuity business plays a bigger role in our overall revenue streams than our transactional business does in the third. So in that EPS range in the third, we have typically been kind of 22% to 24% of the full year. And, you know, when we look at that with the momentum we have on the things that are on that chart, I’d say that we’re more in the middle to the high end of that range in the third and then, you know, the rest obviously in the fourth. So while, you know, those statistics are good indicators in total when we’re going through a transformation like this, you know, at the margin again in the third, we’d say kind of mid to high end of the historical range for third quarter EPS.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Greg. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.
Joseph Foresi
Hi. I wanted to build on the margin question. I was wondering how should we think about the impact of the margin profile, the strategic imperatives through the transformation over the long term? Do you think we’re through the heavy CapEx there and, you know, will the exit of this year and the margin profile there be a good proxy for 2017? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Joe. A couple of things on margins. First, we have talked a bit about what drives margin in the IBM financial model at length, and as you’ll remember, we talked about mix of our business. We’ve talked about productivity in our services business. We’ve talked about portfolio actions. And then this year we started talking about kind of as-a-service based on scale and you can see three of those four elements in our more detailed list of what changes first half to second half. The ones that’s not there obviously is portfolio actions because we don’t have any, you know, we don’t have any big divestitures planned here that are going to drive portfolio. In fact, the way I’d say it is when we look at the portfolio, we think each of the elements can drive value for our clients, and we still see high value in the elements.
Part of the way we get comfortable with each of those elements driving value is when we look at the margins on the strategic imperative content relative to the rest, the margins on the strategic imperatives content has been and second quarter again higher than what we see on the core business. So I interpret that as, you know, the places we’re moving to, the places we’re building value for our clients looks like a pretty high value marketplace, and we’ll continue – it’s one that’s worth us continuing to serve. So we think, you know, we build on margin with three of those four components that we typically have from an as-of-service perspective I don’t think we’re through the capital requirements by any stretch. We’ll continue to shift our capital to the cloud business to make sure that we have got the right scale that we need for our model. So we’re not through it, but again I don’t think IBM is becoming more capital intensive overall. A lot of times it’s just a shift from one to another. And then obviously we’ll keep investing in the capital we need to drive our acquisitions as we integrate those as well.
A – Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Joe. Rowena, can we please take the next question?
Operator
Yes, ma’am. Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
StevenMilunovich
Great. Thank you. The strategic imperative revenue growth, I think it’s slowing. I think it was 17% year-over-year last quarter, 12% this quarter. Analytics is a big piece of that. I think that went from 9% to 5%. Could you talk about what kind of growth you see going forward as these numbers get bigger? And conversely what was the decline in the core franchise revenue? And what’s been the trend there the last few quarters? Thanks.
MartinSchroeter
Sure. Thanks, Steve. On the core, if you will, everything outside the strategic revenue – everything outside the strategic imperatives, that’s kind of been flattish. Right. It’s been flat quarter-to-quarter I should say. It’s down but it’s kind of flat quarter-to-quarter. So in change in trajectory on that part of the business.
In the strategic imperatives, you know, when we started talking about this a year and a half ago at our Investor Day, and we put on the table at the time that that business would grow to $40 billion or 40% of our revenue by, you know, at the end of 2018. We think, and we draw that plum line, we think we’re, you know, I’d say probably a little bit ahead of the track that we need to get there. We’re certainly ahead on the percentage mix because 38% of our business is already there, and we only got – we got 2.5 years to go from a timing perspective.
So we’re on track to the $40 billion because with $31 billion now trailing 12 months, we actually don’t even have to grow at this rate to get over the line. Now, you know, the acquisitions will play a role in this, and we see continued momentum here. But we don’t even have to grow at this rate in order to get where we set out to get a year and a half ago.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Steve. Can we please take the next question?
Operator
Yes. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian White with Drexel. You may ask your question.
Q – Brian White
Yeah. Martin, on the cloud business, so cloud it looks like grew 30% year-over-year. Has the cloud business reached the bottom in the margin profile and is on an upward trajectory? Or do we still have a little bit more of a decline? And if you can just put us – give us some type of an idea where are you in cloud margins versus where you hope to be optimally in, say, four or five years? Thank you.
A – Martin Schroeter
Sure, Brian. So two things. Remember, you know, our cloud business, we’re really – if I had to oversimplify it, we have – we have part of our business helping our clients build their own clouds. And that includes hardware, it includes software, it has some services as well. And when we do that with our clients, the margins we see in those businesses are exactly what we kind of see in the rest. That’s kind of the demand profile of where some of that business is going. The margins don’t look any different from that perspective. To the extent the mix is different between how much hardware and how much software and how much services go in, there may be a different margin on the solution. But as I mentioned in total, our strategic imperatives are mixing a bit richer and so we’re seeing better margins in total across the imperatives. So that’s the – that’s the kind of help our clients build their own cloud.
On the ads of service side of this, I think that as we put on the chart, you know, the ads of service component even though we’re going to continue to drive a fair bit of investment here, the as of service component will start to add – be accretive to our margins on a year-over-year basis starting in the second half already. Now, we’ll see where the marketplace goes and we’ll see where how much we rely on getting or keeping, if you will, that margin growth as opposed to reinvesting. But we see, again, on a big part of some of that cloud business, we see margins that are consistent with what we see in other parts, and the as of service business we start to see year-over-year accretion in the margins from that, even though again, we’ll continue to invest quite heavily.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Brian. Rowena, can we please take the next question.
Operator
Yes, ma’am. Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may ask our question.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. Martin, for overall IBM strategic imperatives grew 38% of revenues, but in GBS strategic imperatives is already over 50% of segment revenue. But yet overall GBS revenue was down 3%. So I think there’s a notion of people expecting aggregate IBM to eventually get to growth as you see strategic imperative mix increase over time, but I was wondering if you can comment more specifically with respect to GBS. What some of the offsets were on that revenue line? I think execution you were alluding to margins, but more specifically on the revenue line, which caused deceleration? What would imply strong deceleration in the core on GBS?
Martin Schroeter
Yeah. Thanks, Wamsi. And that’s right. We did see some pretty strong deceleration or declines in the core of that. And as I said, we’re continuing to shift our skills and our resources out of that part of the marketplace. So in a business which if you oversimplified it is really about how do – how do industry experts charge or bill for their time, your billing is going to be limited or constrained by how much resource you have applied to it. That won’t surprise you.
And then as I mentioned, we moved about 35% of our resource applied to those core parts of the business over into the strategic imperatives. So that has two effects: One, it obviously reduces the ability of us to grow revenue in those places when you constrain the resource; and, two, because the productivity is not a one-for-one, you know, someone who – someone who is billing on an implementation in an enterprise resource kind of an application doesn’t immediately become a cognitive expert or doesn’t immediately become a mobile expert. So there is a productivity impact, and what we give up, while we give up 100% let’s say of that billing capability, we don’t get 100% back right away. And that’s really what you’re seeing in our Consulting business.
In GBS outside of the Consulting, the Application Management, the Global Process Services businesses, they’re fairly stable within the overall GBS equation. But the Consulting business continues to go through this transition as we pull resources off and we put them into and devote the resource or the investments if you will to the strategic imperative areas.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Wamsi. Can we take the next question please?
Operator
Yes. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
James Schneider
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the GBS segment, it sounds given what you just said about the continued pricing headwinds that you’re seeing in the traditional ERP implementations, and maybe the execution issues, that that’s going to be persistent headwind even in the back half of the year. So can you maybe give us some kind of commentary around when you would expect at least the impact of the runoff of some of that more commodity-like business to start to let – not be a headwind anymore? And can you see kind of the end of the execution issues in terms of the cost of some of those implementations that might have been overrun?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Jim. So a couple of things. One, on when do we kind of work our way through this, one thing to look at here is the signings performance in the quarter, and GBS did grow signings in the quarter. Now, there is obviously a lag. It sits in the backlog. And as you saw in our total backlog is flat. I mentioned earlier that GPS [ph] was up in backlog, and obviously therefore the GBS component of that is down a little. So while we are growing signings, which are a pretty good leading indicator of the kind of business, and that’s a function of all the people we have moved into those new areas while we’ve pull back from the others, that total signings equation is now starting to work. We grew signings in total, right? So the new stuff is offsetting if you will the old stuff. But not enough yet to get the backlog back to growth. And we’ve got to get that backlog back to growth in order to have kind of turn the corner for that signings equation, which we got back to growth to get the revenue equation, if you will, back to growth.
A – Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Jim. Let’s take one last question.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. You may ask your question.
David Grossman
Thank you. So, Martin, there are several factors that are impacting the free cash flow conversion this year. Can you help us understand what known factors are out today? Headwinds or tailwinds that we should consider for conversion next year?
A – Martin Schroeter
Sure, David. Thanks. So as we said, we reiterated our view of free cash flow at the end of the first. We were comfortable at the time and remain comfortable to be at the high end of what we had originally provided. So within that, realization for us is a pretty good measure of how we’re converting our cash. Our model is to be in the 90s, and I think with kind of the headwinds, tailwinds we see within free cash flow for the year, I’d say we’re probably more likely to wind up in the high 90s in 2016. Now as we get into next year, you know, there’s a lot that we have to get through in order to understand what next year is going to look like. But I am comfortable that while, you know, we’ll finish again probably high 90s this year. I’m comfortable that our model is right even for next year that we’ll be in the 90s again next year when we look at all of the pieces.
Martin Schroeter
So let me conclude the call by reminding everyone that, you know, we’re running our clients’ most critical process, and that puts us into a pretty unique and terrific, quite frankly, position to move them to the future. And it’s not just about the infrastructure, which is obviously important. We’ve always felt that it’s important and we think it’s important today. But it’s also about helping them become digital businesses and helping them inject cognitive into everything they do. It’s what they’re asking for and it’s quite frankly been our perspective on where the world is going.
So we’re not only doing that with our existing clients and not only doing that in kind of a traditional IT, but in some cases we’re building entirely new businesses, and entirely new markets. And so that, you know, for many is beyond what some of you would focus on in terms of infrastructure, but it’s becoming a bigger and bigger part of what IBM is becoming, and again it’s our view of where value will be created for clients and for our investors. And so as we make those shifts and as we build these new markets, you know, we take – we take our temperature, if you will, at the end of June and we’d say we’re right on track with what we wanted to get done for the year. So with that, thanks for joining the call

Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you've any objections you may disconnect at this time.
Now, I will turn the meeting over to Miss Patricia Murphy. Ma'am, you may begin.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President Investor Relations for IBM. I'm here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter earnings presentation.
The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.
I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from us in Investor Relations.
Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to their related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the form 8-K submitted to the SEC.
Before turning the call over to Martin, I want to remind you that at our investor briefing in late February we discussed a number of changes to our management system and our organizational structure. As a result our segment reporting structure has been updated to reflect our business structure. We provided two years of historical financial information by quarter on these segments a few weeks ago, this can be found in our investor website.
Today we'll be discussing first-quarter results in this new segment structure. In addition you'll see that we've updated our earnings presentation slides not only to address the new segment structure but also to provide additional disclosure on our strategic imperatives and to provide more commentary on the business drivers.
So with that, I'll turn the call to Martin Schroeter.
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Patricia. Again, this quarter, we've made a lot of progress in transforming our business, and we got done what we set out to do to start the year. We delivered $18.7 billion in revenue, $2.3 billion in net income and operating earnings per share of $2.35. Importantly, we also made significant investments and took significant actions to accelerate our transformation and move our business into new areas. Our enterprise clients are looking to get greater value from their data and IT environment. They're not just focused on reducing cost and driving efficiency but using data to improve decision-making and outcomes. They're looking to become digital enterprises that are differentiated by Cognitive.
Our strategy is based on the point of view it this requires a solutions-focused industry expertise and innovative technology, all supported by leading-edge skills. And so to move our clients into the future, we've been making significant changes to our business. We're not only transforming our existing businesses but building new markets and addressing new opportunity areas. We're creating Cognitive Solutions that marry digital business with digital intelligence. We're bringing our industry expertise together with these cognitive solutions and we're building it all on cloud platforms. And because we're running our clients' most critical business processes today, we're in a unique position to move them to the future.
We've been shifting investments and, resources and as we move our business forward we've also changed the way we run our business to be more aligned with these opportunity areas. We have proof points that we're making progress. This quarter, we continued our pattern of strong double-digit growth in our strategic imperatives. This revenue was up 17% at constant currency, which is consistent with our performance on the fourth quarter and continues to be substantially faster than the markets growth. I'll talk about our revenue results on a constant-currency basis throughout the presentation.
So now, over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered $30 billion in revenue which represents 37% of our total revenue. That's two points ahead of where we were 90 days ago. In the quarter, our total cloud revenue grew 36% to $2.6 billion, with the as-a-service components growing 46%. Our annual run rate for the as-a-service revenue is now $5.4 billion. Our analytics revenue grew 9% on a locked base you'll recall as an $18 billion business for us last year. And mobile and security each posted strong double-digit growth.
As we transform our business and move into new areas we need to transform our workforce; not only the types of skills but how we operate. This quarter we took significant actions to transform our workforce and shift our skills base to new areas and to improve our structure primarily outside the U.S. This resulted in a pre-tax charge of just under $1.5 billion. As we discussed in late February, we also had a tax refund in the quarter of $1 billion plus interest. And so the amount of the tax benefit was essentially equivalent to the charges on an after-tax basis. It's important to recognize that these actions are impacting our profit and margins this quarter while improving our position for the future.
We're continuing to invest and add capabilities to build out our Cognitive and Cloud Platforms. I'll comment on a few items from the first quarter alone. We completed the acquisition of The Weather Company's digital assets. This is not only a source of valuable weather data but a high-volume, cloud-based, insight-driven platform. We're bringing this together with our organic Watson capabilities to form the basis of our Watson IoT platform.
This quarter we announced a number of partnerships with companies including VMware to accelerate the adoption of enterprise hybrid clouds, and GitHub to advance the development of next-gen cloud applications for enterprises. And we've brought Swift to the cloud, enabling mobile developers to build end-to-end mobile hybrid apps. We've integrated a portion of our software business into our cloud business, and all of IBM's relevant software is now in the IBM cloud.
We acquired Ustream and will bring it together with software and our object storage capabilities to extend our leadership in cloud video services. At the end of the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Bluewolf, a top Salesforce partner and leader in cloud consulting and implementation services.
GBS is already the largest digital design agency, and this quarter we extended our capabilities with the announcement of three acquisitions that will be integrated into IBM Interactive Experience.
We're continuing to expand our Watson ecosystem and reach. Over the last 12 months, the number of developers using Watson APIs is up over 300% and the number of enterprises we've engaged with has doubled. Watson solutions are being built, used, and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries. And this quarter, we significantly added to our Watson Health platform with the acquisition of Truven, a leading provider of cloud-based healthcare data, analytics, and insights. This was announced in February and closed just over a week ago. I'll expand on these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions.
But first, I'll turn to our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was $18.7 billion. Currency continues to be a headwind to our reported revenue performance, over 2.5 points this quarter. This is 0.5 point better than the low end of the range we provided in mid-January, or about $90 million translation benefit. On a constant currency basis, our decline of 2% is consistent with last quarter. Now, within that 2% decline, when you consider the impact of the mainframe cycle and the additional content from acquisitions this quarter, our underlying revenue growth rate improved by 2 points versus the prior quarter.
From a geography perspective, our performance in the Americas was consistent with last quarter with improvement in the U.S. and a decline in Latin America driven by Brazil. We've built a strong business in Brazil over the years, though the last few quarters have been more volatile. This quarter Brazil was down, in part due to a tough compare but also an economic environment that looks uncertain. We've taken some action to refocus our business which impacts our growth in the short term. EMEA posted a modest decline while Asia-Pacific grew for the first time in quite a while.
Our gross margin performance reflects higher levels of investment and a mix impact within our segments. Our systems margin was up consistent with the product cycle dynamics in our z Systems as well as improvements in power and storage.
You can see our expense was up significantly, driven by charges for the actions to accelerate the transformation of our business. These charges impacted pre-tax income by $1.5 billion and pre-tax margin by 8 points in the quarter. I'll talk more about the charges and implications for the future later.
Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an underlying rate of 19% as well as the benefit from the resolution of a tax case outside the U.S. This was a discrete item and drove our tax rate negative.
From a cash perspective, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, about half of that coming from the tax benefit. Over the last 12 months, we've generated over $14 billion of free cash flow, and this is 110% of GAAP net income. Given the seasonality of our cash flow, it's best to look at realization on a trailing 12-month basis. And in the last year we returned about two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and gross share repurchases.
With the changes we've made to our management system and organizational structure, we've implemented a new segment structure. As Patricia mentioned, we provided historical information on this segment structure a few weeks ago. Before getting into results for this quarter, I want to spend a minute on the structure. Our segment discussions will also be a little longer than is typical to address the drivers and performance on this basis and the progress we're making in moving our business to the future.
So looking at the segments, Cognitive Solutions includes the solutions software addressing many of our strategic areas including analytics, security, and social as well as the transaction processing software. Many of these are new opportunity areas like Watson Health and Watson IoT, opening up revenue and profit pools beyond traditional IT. Because we're building new businesses in new markets, they'll ramp over time.
The scope of our Global Business Services segment overall is unchanged, though we're now providing our revenue results for consulting, global process services, and application management, which is aligned with the way we're now organized and going to market. GBS has been shifting its business towards the solution areas including creation of a cognitive consulting practice, and earlier this year GBS strengthened its industry capabilities.
As we bring the industry expertise together with Cognitive Solutions offerings, we'll put more focus on the combination of these two businesses, which we refer to as Cognitive Solutions and Industry Services.
Technology Services and Cloud Platforms includes our global technology services business and IBM's cloud infrastructure and platform capabilities. This business now includes WebSphere and related software products, reflecting the importance of integration software to the enterprise grade hybrid clouds.
Systems include our hardware offerings of z Systems, power and storage, and now also the related operating system software.
Global Financing is unchanged, consisting of client and commercial financing and used equipment sales.
Now, as we've said, the primary driver of the changes to our operating structure and subsequently our segments is the realignment of our software portfolio as software value shifts to new areas. Software is made up of our Cognitive Solutions segment, integration software, and operating system software. We've broken out the revenue and gross profit results within the segments, but as we transition to the new structure we'll also provide a perspective on total software. I'll talk about it after going through the four segment discussions, and we've also provided information in our supplemental charts. Given the solutions nature of our offerings, our strategic imperatives are included in each of our segments, and so going forward we're providing additional information on the strategic imperatives revenue within each segment.
So now let's turn to the segment performance, and I'll start Cognitive. I mentioned that solutions software includes analytic, security, and social. To give you some context, analytics is the largest part of our solutions portfolio and includes our traditional analytics platform, industry solutions, commerce, and the Watson-related businesses. Transaction processing software, on the other hand, primarily runs mission-critical systems in industries like banking, airlines, and retail. This includes our offerings such as CICS, TPS, and IMS running on z Systems which were primarily reflected in other middleware in our previously reported software segment. Most of it is on-premise and annuity in nature, and not a growing opportunity in the software market.
In the first quarter, Cognitive Solutions generated revenue of $4 billion, which was up modestly year-to-year. Solutions software grew, mitigated by a decline in transaction processing software. Our solutions software growth of 3% was a significant sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. Contributing to this growth was strong double-digit performance in our Watson cloud based offerings and acquisitive content. From an offering perspective, the growth was led by analytics and security. In both of these areas, we have highly differentiated strategies and capabilities.
Security isn't just about trying to keep things out; we approach security as a big data problem. On average today, organizations use 80 security products from 40 different vendors, and they're looking for us to bring all this together. We're in a unique position as we not only provide our own leading capabilities but bring it all together for them in an integrated solution. Security solutions are a mix of on-premise software and software-as-a-service, and we believe we have the largest enterprise security software-as-a-service business.
Our leadership and momentum continued into the first quarter with high single-digit growth in our security software, outpacing the market. In addition, we continue to invest to build our security platform, and we've recently acquired Resilient Systems, which provides leading incident response capabilities. This acquisition expands our overall leadership in security where we lead the market in four out of six security segments. With our differentiated strategy and our market leadership, we can attract the best talent in a very competitive market. We now have more than 7,000 security experts, maybe more than 1,000 in the last year. We can attract top talent because we're not just identifying problems and doing audits, we're solving security problems.
Our approach in analytics is also unique and differentiated. We're building an industrial strength cognitive platform that is cloud-based and leverages Watson. It's also supported by industry-specific data and an ecosystem to help provide new insights in key industries. This allows us to go after a new $2 trillion market opportunity beyond the $1.2 trillion traditional IT market. So it's a new and incremental opportunity for us.
Watson Healthcare is our first industry-focused area, where we're creating a new market. This is an industry with billions of dollars of new revenue opportunity for IBM. We started to move into the cognitive healthcare space just about a year ago and have invested $4 billion through four acquisitions. We're scaling rapidly, moving from effectively no employees to more than 6,000 in a year. Most came to us through the acquisitions, but we've also hired nearly 700 employees who are highly skilled healthcare professionals who will now make a difference in millions of lives. We believe success will be based on building platforms, and we're focused on leveraging partnerships and ecosystems.
We're now working with clients such as the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, and Under Armour, in addition to initial partners of Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, CVS, and many more. As I mentioned, in early April we closed our Truven acquisition that brings more than 8,500 clients to our Watson Health portfolio, including employers, health insurers, hospitals, clinicians, life sciences companies, and government agencies that support health programs. Data and insights from Truven inform benefit decisions for one in three Americans.
We're already seeing the signs of our strategy playing out. In the first quarter we closed deals with a few large healthcare insurers, who have millions of members that can use our Watson Health cloud-based solutions. We believe that the healthcare industry is moving to value-based care. It is still early stages, but as the market shifts, we're positioned to deliver value.
We're also broadening the reach of Watson as it starts to support an increasing number of decisions. Let me share a few more examples. When we first introduced Watson, it could reach a population of 400 million English-speaking people. As Watson has been taught more languages, it can now speak with another billion people in their native language. We are working on our Watson oncology solution with a number of hospitals that have a combined reach of more than three million patients.
You heard from a few of our healthcare clients on Investor Day. Let me comment on another in insurance that has Watson in production. Geico is using Watson in 46 states to enhance aspects of their industry-leading digital channel. They're encouraged by the results they have seen with existing and new policyholders in areas including online experience, engagement, and sales.
So now, looking at the profit results for this segment, the gross margin is impacted by a lower level of transactional revenue and the fact that more of our new areas where we're investing are cloud-based and build over time. The pre-tax income performance also reflects a higher level of investment in areas like Watson Platform, Watson Health, and Watson IoT, as well as an impact from workforce rebalancing charges and currency.
Global Business Services delivered $4.1 billion of revenue, which is down 2%. As I mentioned earlier, Global Business Services segment content in total did not change, but within GBS we are now reporting consulting, global process services, and application management, consistent with the way we're running the business.
Our application management business helps modernize a client's application processes and brings apps to market faster through digital cloud platforms like Bluemix. Our application management revenue represents about 45% of GBS revenue. Performance was relatively stable last year and that continued into the first quarter.
In consulting, which is another 45% or so of our revenue, the process of shifting to the new areas continues to impact our growth rate, but we did see some improvement versus the prior quarter. Global process services revenue, which is less than 10% of GBS revenue, was down 1%.
At our investor briefing in February, we spent time on the shift that we're driving in GBS away from some of the more traditional areas into the more strategic areas. This quarter, GBS revenue in the strategic imperatives was up 22%, with strong growth across our cloud, analytics, mobility, and security practices.
We're expanding our design capabilities as consumer-grade experience is becoming a new strategy for enterprises. This quarter, we announced three acquisitions that will be integrated into the IBM Interactive Experience, the largest global digital agency. Through our experienced design capabilities, we're able to bring clients the distinct combination of industry insight, design thinking, and end-to-end digital transformation. We are delivering high-value digital services in over 25 studios worldwide, including a new studio in Dubai that we announced this quarter.
We are investing in expanding our skills in other areas as well. We've recently announced the acquisition of Bluewolf, which has over 500 resources across the U.S., Europe, and Australia. This will extend our industry consulting leadership with one of the world's leading salesforce consulting practices to deliver differentiated consumer-grade experiences through the cloud.
Our Apple partnership continues to redesign workflows and drive productivity for our clients. We recently announced strategic mobile transformation products with RWE Generation in Germany for mobile maintenance of heavy mining equipment; with Alior Bank in Poland to transform the way clients experience banking services; and with Etisalat in Egypt to deploy the Expert Tech app and transform how its remote site support technicians deliver services to their customers.
Turning to GBS profit, our gross margin was down about a point and a half as we continue to invest to drive our transformation. We're engineering the shift of our resources to higher-value services, which has a near-term impact on our margin. Our strategy is based on moving to higher value, so we'll continue this shift. We continue to see price and profit pressure in some parts of the portfolio. Looking at pre-tax profit performance, more than half the margin decline is driven by the structural actions we took this quarter. At the same time, we continue to invest in our digital and cognitive practices. These actions will help us progress our transformation in GBS.
Technology Services and Cloud Platforms delivered $8.4 billion of revenue, up 2%. For the segment, our strategic imperative revenue was up 45%, driven by our cloud revenue which was up 50%. Our view on cloud is that enterprises see the most value in hybrid cloud solutions that enable new business models while leveraging existing systems and data. We brought Global Technology Services closer together with IBM's cloud infrastructure and platform capabilities to better position us to deliver these solutions to our clients.
We will provide a view of infrastructure services, technical support services, and integration software. Infrastructure services reflects our evolution from a systems integrator to a services integrator, driven by the move to hybrid cloud. It includes our previous strategic outsourcing and integrated technology services lines.
Technical support services provides a complete line of support services to maintain and improve the ability of clients' IT infrastructures. This includes maintenance for both IBM and non-IBM products as well as some support previously reported in integrated technology services.
Infrastructure services was up 4% this quarter as clients continue to turn to us as a trusted partner to modernize their most critical IT systems and move them to hybrid. For example, at Chubb, we're implementing a new hybrid cloud model designed to enhance customer service and strengthen their industry practices. This new agile infrastructure will be designed to fit a wide variety of business needs, including enhanced user experience, faster deployment of services, and increased speed to market.
We're also working with one of Indostat, one of Indonesia's largest telecommunications and services providers that serves 70 million mobile customers. They need a cloud partner with scale, and we will deliver solutions on the IBM cloud that will help Indonesian businesses drive innovation and agility, streamline their process, and improve productivity.
We continue to see strong momentum in software, which again grew to strong double digits this quarter. We continue to invest to build out our global capability, announcing a new cloud datacenter in South Africa to support large regional service provider clients like Gijima and Vodacom.
Earlier this quarter, about 25,000 clients and partners attended our global InterConnect conference where we made some important announcements as we continue to evolve the IBM cloud. We announced that 100% of relevant software is now available in the cloud through a series of offerings such as WebSphere Connect where more than 200 million global licenses can now access the cloud. This fundamentally transforms how enterprise clients extend their existing IT investments and capabilities to the cloud.
We also announced we are the first to bring the Swift programming language to the server. Swift is used by about 11 million developers to build Apple iOS applications to radically simplify the development of end-to-end applications and help enterprises reach new levels of productivity.
We also launched several important strategic partnerships as we continue to build out our ecosystem. With VMware, we've jointly designed an architecture and cloud offering that will allow nearly half a million VMware customers to extend their virtual machines to the IBM cloud. And with GitHub, we'll be delivering an enterprise offering to the more than 12 million developers that will allow them to build and run applications consistently across public and private environments.
We continue to expand our cloud capabilities with the acquisition of Ustream and the formation of the IBM cloud video services unit that will that will provide our clients with a powerful portfolio of video services and digital analytics. Ustream provides cloud-based video streaming and on-demand video to about 80 million viewers per month for customer such as Facebook, Nike, the Discovery Channel, Samsung, and NASA.
Looking at the software content in this segment, integration software was down 2%. Our annuity content is growing with stability in our on-premises content and acceleration in the adoption of SaaS, specifically in the products that integrate a hybrid cloud environment, like application servers and our Connect family of products.
Looking at profit, Technology Services and Cloud Platforms' gross margin was down just over a point year-to-year. Margin is impacted by the revenue trajectory of integration software as we move more of the portfolio to an as-a-service model delivered through the cloud. Within infrastructure services, we're investing to contemporize our clients' IT systems as we bring on new contracts.
At the pre-tax profit level, our margin decline reflects the continued investment to build up platforms such as Bluemix and SoftLayer as we drive our transformation as well as currency impacts. This quarter also includes the impact of the workforce transformation actions, which is about half of the decline.
Our Systems segment comprises our systems hardware business and operating system software. Systems revenue was about $1.7 billion this quarter, which was down about 20%. Our hardware revenue was down 25%, primarily reflecting the product cycle in our z Systems. Operating systems continue to be a headwind to growth. This quarter, the revenue was down 7%.
So looking at the hardware performance by brand, our z Systems revenue was down 40% on the back of a very strong performance of up 130% last year when we launched our new z13. Typically, we see better margins in z Systems as we move into the back half of the cycle, and we did see some good margin improvement this quarter.
After four quarters of growth, Power revenue was down double digits as we ramped on a strong performance in UNIX-based entry systems from last year. But we had continued momentum in our Linux offerings and expansion of OpenPOWER efforts. We've been focused on the growth in Power-based Linux systems and they've now grown to about 10% of the overall revenue base.
We recently signed a deal with a large enterprise in China that is dramatically growing its Linux server footprint, and has chosen Linux on Power partly because they can do it with half of the footprint they would have required with x86. The relationship will lead to the installation of thousands of Linux on Power Systems.
We also continued to see good traction with the OpenPOWER Foundation-based innovations, which will ultimately drive adoption of the Power platform and provide intellectual property income. Just a few weeks ago, Google, a founding member of the OpenPOWER Foundation, announced that it is working with Rackspace, an Open Compute Project founding member, to codevelop an open server specification based around IBM's new POWER9 architecture. The two companies will submit a candidate POWER9 server design to the Open Compute Project.
Turning to Storage, hardware revenue was down 6%, which continues to reflect weakness in the overall storage market. We are well positioned to capture the strategic growth areas of flash, software-defined storage, and object storage, which together grew in the quarter.
Our Systems gross profit margin was up with improvement across z Systems, Power, and Storage. Our pre-tax income decline reflects the improved gross margin on the lower revenue and the impact of the actions we took this quarter, which is about half of the decline.
So now, let me come back to the performance of software across our segments. Our total software revenue was down less than 1%. This is a significant improvement from our performance last quarter, which was down 6%. We got the improvement we expected from the higher mix of annuity versus transactional content in the first quarter. In addition, we've been adding a lot of new capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, and this quarter software growth reflected the acquisitions which closed over the last year. These acquisitions contribute to revenue growth but impact our profit performance in the first year.
Our annuity revenue was up 2% in the quarter with steady renewal rates and growth in our SaaS business. From a product area perspective, growth in our solutions software was offset by a continued headwind in operating systems and transaction processing software.
Let me make one other comment on our software performance. As I mentioned earlier, total software includes cognitive solutions, integration software, and operating systems. This includes a portion of our software support line revenue that was previously reported in our GTS segment. The addition of support line did not impact our software growth rate this quarter. Our software revenue was down 0.8 points including support line and would've been down 0.8 points without support line.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations in the quarter excluding our financing receivables and $2.3 billion of free cash flow. This is up over $1 billion year-to-year. This year-to-year increase was driven by the tax benefit of $1 billion plus interest. As I mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions that impacted our profit this quarter and will impact our cash flow over the next several quarters.
Looking at the uses of cash in the quarter, we invested just under $1 billion in capital expenditures with continued investment in cloud capacity. We closed six acquisitions this quarter, and acquisition spend was over $2.5 billion, with the largest being The Weather Company transaction. The Truven acquisition closed about a week and a half ago and so will be included in our second quarter acquisition spend.
We returned over $2 billion to shareholders including $1.2 billion in dividends, and we bought back over 6.5 million shares. At the end of March we had $4.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Looking at the balance sheet highlights, we ended the quarter with nearly $15 billion in cash and $46 billion in total debt, both of which are up an equivalent amount from year-end, driven by the timing of this year's term debt issuances. About $27 billion of our total debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7:1.
I want to mention that the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 51% investment grade, which you can see in the supplemental charts. We had a few point reduction in investment grade over the last couple of quarters driven by rating changes in our existing portfolio, not by changes in how we approach the market. Now, this data is based on the credit ratings of the companies in our portfolio. We do take actions to transfer exposure to third parties where we then get the credit ratings of the insurance companies. We've done this for many years. And on that basis, our investment-grade content increases by 14 points to 65%.
Our non-financing debt was $18.8 billion, up year-to-year driven by the timing of our debt issuances this year relative to the maturities, and as I mentioned, the increase is equivalent to the increase in cash. We continue to be very well positioned to support our long-term growth strategy.
Let me spend a minute on some of the larger items that impacted the first quarter results and give you a sense of the implications of these actions for the balance of the year. The tax benefit contributed about $1.20 to EPS. As I mentioned, our underlying tax rate was 19% in the quarter, consistent with the range we provided at the beginning of the year of 18% plus or minus a couple of points. This, of course, doesn't include discrete or one-time items.
As we transform our business, we need to transform our workforce, and in this quarter we took a pre-tax charge for workforce rebalancing of $1 billion or $0.84 of earnings per share. Some of this charge is used to take action where we've been dealing with underutilization, but the vast majority is to shift and rebalance our skills.
As we build new businesses in areas like Watson Health and Watson Internet of Things, this requires different skills and to be in different places. I mentioned earlier that over the last year we've added over 6,000 resources in Watson Health and added over 1,000 security experts. These are specialized skills in highly competitive areas. So this is not about reducing our capacity; this is about transforming our workforce. We started the year with just under 380,000 people. We have people leaving the business, but we're also adding large numbers of resources. We currently have tens of thousands of open positions, and we're hiring aggressively. So if we have similar hiring dynamics to last year, we could end the year with an employee base that is about the same as where we started. Our hiring will be aligned to where we see demand, by skill area, and by geography. As we look at the resource actions, about 90% of the spending is outside the U.S.
Now, looking at the returns on this action, we expect we'll save about $500 million this year, maybe a little more, and nearly $2 billion on an annualized basis. When you look at the makeup of the $1 billion charge, a couple hundred was in the run rate and drives the bulk of the $500 million savings this year. The balance of the charge was for actions that yield the remainder due to geographic mix and timing. But as I said, this is about rebalancing skills rather than capacity reduction, and so we think about this as spending that is freed up to be reinvested in building capabilities in our strategic imperatives.
As we transform our workforce, we're changing how we're working, more agile, more collaboratively, and this requires a different work environment. So this quarter, we took a real estate charge of over $300 million as we changed the way we work, moving to agile with less space required. We also took actions to reposition the business in Latin America in light of the macro conditions. I mentioned earlier that we've refocused our business in Brazil including reducing exposure in our financing and services portfolio this quarter. We also reduced our exposure in Venezuela.
As you know, we've always had some unique items in the quarter, but we've included here the items that accelerate our transformation. We didn't include for example the nearly $40 million loss from the sale of our remaining equity position in Lenovo. We have no future exposure there.
So we made good progress in transforming our business this quarter. We continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives, and as I've said earlier, they now represent 37% of our revenue. We added significant capabilities this quarter through organic investments, acquisitions, and partnerships, and we took significant actions to improve our position for the long term. As we look forward, we expect much of what we saw in the first quarter to continue. We expect to drive strong growth in our strategic imperatives.
Our acquisitions are starting to contribute to our top line, and while they are a drag on profit in the first few quarters, they will certainly contribute to the profit base over time. We will continue to invest at a high level. Much of the capabilities we're building are cloud-based and delivered as a service. Both the higher investment levels and the return profile put some pressure on our profit in the near term but we're confident it's right for the long term. As I just mentioned, we'll start to yield some of the benefits from the actions we just took but we do expect much of it to be reinvested. When we take all of this into consideration, we continue to expect at least $13.50 of operating earnings per share for the year.
You'll recall that last quarter I said that we expect free cash flow realization of GAAP net income in the 90s, which implied a range of $11 billion to $12 billion of free cash flow for the year at the $13.50 level. We have now improved our view of free cash flow for the year and now expect free cash flow to come in at the high end of that range at that same profit level.
As we look at the second quarter, we typically see a profit improvement from first to second quarter. In fact, last year, it was $1 billion increase in pre-tax income. This year, we expect more given the significant charges in our first quarter, but we'll also have an impact from the acquisition ramp and quarter-to-quarter impact from currency hedges. Put it all together and we see about a $2 billion increase in pre-tax profit from first to second quarter. With our anticipated tax rate and our share repurchase, at that profit level we'd achieve between 38% and 39% of the $13.50 of earnings per share by the end of the first half.
So to finish, again, this quarter we made a lot of progress in transforming our business and we got done what we set out to do to start the year. Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. These too have been updated to reflect the new segment structure and additional information provided. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.
Operator, let's please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. One moment, please, for the first question. First question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Thanks, Martin, for all the detail. Just to build on your closing comment on the original 15% from last quarter, timing-wise, what shifted from what you expected? Or is there some conservatism to consider? Because I guess with what you reported, it looks like actual could be around 17.5% of the full-year guidance.
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Tien-tsin. So, you're right. If we were just to line up the math of where we finished relative to the at least $13.50 at that base level, we'd be about 17%. So the first quarter, I would say I'd characterize a couple of ways. One, on the top line, we got done what we wanted to get done and, in fact, the signposts that we've given to our investor community around driving double-digit growth while we continue to invest in those areas played out pretty much as we expected. And we are growing our revenue in those strategic imperatives faster than the marketplace, which we think is an important element as we transform the business.
On the profit side, the first quarter played out kind of the way we said we would get done what we would in February, which was we were going to get a tax benefit and that we were going to accelerate the transformation. So we put of all of that together and while – because we had some of the restructuring already in the run rate, if you will, we did better, if you will, than what the original guidance implied. So the math you're doing is kind of spot on relative to that $13.50. We are seeing the dynamics in the revenue lines that we had expected and we're seeing the profit equation come together as we kind of expected, again, given that nuance that we had some of the restructuring in the run rate.
The other thing I'd point out, what's not in yet is obviously some of the newer acquisition content. We closed on Truven about a week and a half ago. We closed on The Weather Company's digital assets during the quarter, so not a full quarter. Those come also with our intent to grow the spending in those to create new solutions. So when they come in, at whatever profitability they were, we build our business cases around substantial investment in those two. So we'll get the revenue but the profit impact, as we said in the prepared remarks, will last for a couple of quarters.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Tien-tsin. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify something, just because you said it very quickly at the end of the call, and then I have a real question. So you're guiding for 38% to 39% of earnings in the first half, which I think implies $2.85 in EPS for Q2. That's about $0.60 below consensus, and only about a 21% increase sequentially. Historically I think you're at 30% or 35%. So I just want to be sure I did the math right on that. That's the clarification.
And my real question is, it's really just where you think you are in the transformation. We continue to see really good growth on the strategic imperatives. But revenue growth at constant currency was minus 2 and I think on an organic basis was probably about minus 3. And that's kind of at the low end of what you've done over the last eight quarters or so. So maybe you could help us understand, is it just the combination of the transformation still requiring time? Or is there something about the move to an as-a-service model? But why aren't we seeing some gradual improvement in revenue on a constant currency basis? And can you help us understand, is there something that you either anniversary or overlap, or when investors should think about seeing that inflection point in terms of improving revenues?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Thanks, Toni. So first, on your clarifying non-question, I think the way you described it is what we said. We said we'd get 38% to 39% of the first half done, and your math was right on. The one thing, though, I think it's important to remember, and I know you know this, but I think we ought to bear in mind the business looks fundamentally different as we transform it. And so, using first-half averages from days gone by when currency was different and the level of transformation and the pace of transformation was different and the levels of investment were different, I would caution our investors to make sure they understand the underpinnings of that. And so that's why we laid out, if you will, within my prepared remarks – that's why we laid out what we saw happening in this quarter from first to second. So again, your math was right, we said 38% to 39%. But again, there is a lot more going on within the transformation than just the statistics. And I think it's important to understand the componentry.
In terms of where we are in the transformation, I think I'd make a few comments. One, continued growth in the strategic imperatives – as you said, good growth and we're pleased with the double-digit growth. It's a big part of how we're measuring our progress. The other element that we're measuring, and we talked about this at Investor Day and it holds true as well in the first is, are the spaces we're going to, are they generating higher value than the spaces we're moving from? And as we showed at Investor Day, our gross margins in those new areas continue to be higher, and they were higher again in the first. So that's an important element for us. Again, grow those businesses and make sure they're higher value.
At the same time, part of our transformation is to create new opportunities. And so we spent a bit of time at Investor Day, as you know, talking about not only the traditional IT opportunity. And I would put things like our new cloud video services unit into that, where we get to apply a globally scalable cloud approach on an industry basis with our industry expertise. And so that's a good example of how we're shifting into new areas in the cloud world in the traditional space. But part of this transformation is all about moving into businesses that don't yet exist.
And so when you mention, is it as-a-service, is it something else, these are as-a-service businesses, and so we do expect there to take a while to ramp. But we did get to put a lot of money to work over the past 12 months. In fact, our acquisition activity over the last 12 months, if you include Truven now – so we just closed Truven about a week and a half ago – we spent about $9 billion now over that time period on acquisitions, which is more than we've spent in any 12-month period in IBM. So, part of this is also on building those new businesses.
So where are we in the transformation? It is continued focus on shifting our investments into those strategic imperatives, it is making sure that the space we're moving to is higher margin and higher profit opportunity for us and then making sure we're investing aggressively to keep those businesses growing.

Thanks, Toni. Rowena, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes. Thanks, Martin. The software and the GBS businesses have the highest strategic content, and both of those declines improved from what you outlined happened in 2015 at the Analyst Day. At the same time, deferred revenue grew for the first time in almost two years, which is tied to at least the software portion of the business. So, just curious if you isolate those two segments where you've had some big headwinds. Do you feel like you're moving beyond that and you've seen a sustainable turn in those businesses? Or is there something about annuity versus transactional mix in the first quarter where we shouldn't assume that those businesses continue to get better? Thank you.
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Katy. So, a couple of things. First, on software, we did talk about in January that we would we'd get an improved trajectory in our software business just from the mix of transactional annuity, and we did get that. So we did see an improvement from the mix in lower transactional content in the first, then in the fourth that drove some improvement.
Secondly, we also got a benefit from the acquisition content that closed. That added about 2 points as well to the software performance. So with the annuity component of our software business continuing to grow, with the acquisition content coming in, I do feel okay about our software business going forward and the acquisitions that we've completed more recently will also help support that software business. So from a revenue perspective I feel okay about the investments we've made and the future of the software business.
Now, on the profit side, those take spending to create the kinds of solutions that we think will create new markets, so we'll continue to invest heavily, but the improvement we got from the mix was what we said we would get in the first and then we got the benefit of acquisitions as well.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Very good...
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, Katy. You also asked about GBS. So on GBS, we did see a sequential improvement from fourth to first, and we saw that in our consulting business as well. Now, in the GBS business, the strategic imperatives content continues to do fine in the GBS business, and we'll continue to shift our labor pools and our expertise into those. And you saw that we made some acquisitions in that digital channel to create – again, to keep our lead, I should say, in being the world's largest digital agency.
What you also saw us do over the last few months now in GBS is we moved – we continued to move our business to where we see the greatest consulting opportunities. And quite frankly, we stayed in these big ERP implementations a bit too long. And so now, what you saw us buy a few months ago was a company called Meteorix, which is really built around helping companies move into workday solutions. And then you saw us recently announced the acquisition of a company called Bluewolf, which works on sales force implementations.
And so as the world moves into what we've always said it would, which is that the shift to cloud creates consulting opportunities because companies have to fundamentally change workflow, we did, quite frankly, move a little bit late, so we're playing a little bit of catch-up in that part of the business. But with these two acquisitions, we'll drive growth in what are two pretty hot market opportunities and we'll continue then to pull resources away from that commoditizing content and drive more the shift into the strategic imperatives.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Katy. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Yes, Ma'am. Thank you. Next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. You may ask your question.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thanks. So, Martin, can I just quickly follow up on your software comment? So based on current visibility, can growth stay on this trajectory in the more seasonally difficult second quarter, and will acquisitions actually contribute more in the June quarter given the first quarter activity?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So the simple answer is that acquisitions that we've gotten done now will add again to the growth rate in the second quarter. If I looked at – if we look at just the Cognitive Solutions segment as an example, part of that business, our transaction processing system business – that's a very high value business. It declined 5% in the quarter, but it's in a declining market opportunity space. And so we're providing very high value to our clients. We run their most important transaction systems. We'll continue to do that. We'll continue to refresh those products that delivers the new capability, but quite frankly, that is an opportunity that will decline over time. But again, we'll decline with it. We won't lose share.
When we look at the software solutions part of that Cognitive segment, you saw that we got back to low single-digit growth in the first, and with the acquisition content we see that continuing to accelerate even in the second already. So that acquisition content will help bolster the software results as we go through the rest of the year.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, David. Can we take the next question please?
Rowena? We can't hear anything from our side, Rowena?
Operator
Yes. Hello? Yes. Hello. Our next question is from Louis Miscioscia from CLSA. You may ask your question.
Louis Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC
Okay. Thank you. So going back to GBS again, you have strategic imperatives there at $3.1 billion, and that the total category is $4.1 billion. So when we look at the revenue, should we assume that that $1 billion that's not in the strategic imperative that's not growing is what's basically got a wind-down? And maybe you could give us an idea of how quickly you think you can transfer that over, or maybe I just couldn't (52:45) do the math on the percent decline, if that's accurate?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I guess the way to think about it is that within the Global Business Services, that the areas we're moving out of have a lot of price pressure. So implementing these large-scale ERP implementations, we see a lot of price pressure in there. And the areas we're moving into are continuing to grow pretty well, but we're building those. By the way, they're going to take a while to build. Some of them are brand-new practices. So as an example, we just announced the creation last year, at the end of last year, of a cognitive practice. That doesn't exist anywhere. It's the world's first. We are building skills there.
So within the GBS segment, again, this shift we've been working on, we were a little bit late in some parts of it and moving more into – if you will, moving more into the consulting side of this. But we have the total of strategic imperatives is within that segment is about $2 billion of the $4.1 billion. The chart that you may be looking at is not additive, right? The strategic imperatives are $2 billion. The cloud element is $600 million; that's within the $2 billion. And then the as-a-service is $0.5 billion; that's within that as well. So it's not additive, it's not three – one of the four; it's two of the four with those two as the components.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Lou. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Milunovich from UBS. You may ask your question.
Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. A couple of quick ones. Number one, the currency impact last quarter, you said, would be $1.10 hit to earnings this year. With currency now improved, what is that number likely to be? Number two, free cash flow. You said $11 billion to $12 billion; now, at the high end. Is the only difference the $1.2 billion that you received in the tax rebate, or has anything else changed in your underlying view? And then third, do you expect any more restructuring charges this year? Are those in your guidance at all?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Steve, thank you for the non-multipart – no, it's okay Steve. As you said, they are quick. They're good questions because it's all important data. So first, on constant currency, we said that in total, the currency impact would be over $1 billion for us in the year. Now, bear in mind that a big part of that, the bulk of that, almost all of it, was because of the hedges we had last year which we're not going to get this year. So we had to work our way through that. Now, at current rates, obviously we see – we still see the same size impact from the hedges because those were there last year. At current rates we would get a bit of a translation benefit, but I think it's really important to recognize that while as much as we like to think this is uniform on both sides of a dollar move, and we do believe that a weaker dollar on balance helps us, a weaker dollar also drives renegotiation in price and other things that come into the equation. So the impact at this point, the hedge impact on the currency rates today is obviously exactly the same. We'd do a little bit better at this point in profit if we were able to keep it; we'd do a little bit better there for the rest of the year.
On free cash flow, I'd say it really is – I wouldn't attribute it all to the tax that we got back. I would attribute it to we're through 90 days, we've have $100-plus billion balance sheet, and when we look at the ins and outs and the efficiency of the balance sheet, we feel incrementally more positive about the realization for the year.
And then on restructuring, this is something where – and we tried to go through this a bit in the prepared remarks – it really is about shifting the work force from a set of skills that have value in the marketplace today to a new set of skills where we're trying and build new businesses. The minority of the charge, if you will, is for reductions in usable capacity, and most of that's outside the U.S. The bulk of this is to get new set of skills. So as we build a Watson Health business, as we build out our security practice, we're adding new skills. So we'll see.
We think about our ability to acquire skills. In many of these sectors, we will hire them as quickly as the world can create them. We hired 1,000 security experts last year and quite frankly, if world created 2,000 of the caliber and the kind of talent we needed, we would've hired 2,000. But the world creates these skills at a certain rate and we'll hire them as aggressively as we can. We have some limits in terms of how do we put them to work and where's the demand and does that all match up, but we'll hire people as aggressively as we can as we build these businesses out. We are relying on some pretty unique talents in some these businesses.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Steve. Can we take the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, thank you. Next question is from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the services business, what you're seeing there specifically as it relates to your customers' discretionary spending outlook for services. You had a very strong signing quarter last quarter, but that was not so strong this quarter. I think it was down 17% year-over-year. Understanding that that can be very lumpy, does it say anything about the discretionary outlook for services among your clients? And can you maybe just address when we might expect to see that margin inflection in GBS?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So, a couple things. On services, in terms of signings, as you said, they tend to be lumpy. Maybe not the most elegant of words to describe it, but it is an accurate description of what happens in any 90-day period. Quite frankly, when you look at the kinds of relationships we're building with our clients, neither the IBM teams involved that are building these nor our clients are thinking about these on a 90-day cycle. These are pretty big, transformative partnerships that we build, and they're running and trusting us to run their most important and most critical systems. So it's completely understandable why a 90-day reporting cycle may not work.
We also have looked, and we've told our investors over time to look at the backlog. So when you look, for instance, within the GTS business, our backlog, even with the signings performance in the quarter, but because we've had strong signings last year we grew the backlog 1%.
And I think that's indicative of the kind of demand profile we see for those kinds of services. Remember, within that business there is certainly an element of productivity, i.e. our clients are asking us to do and manage that for them in a way that gets them to a sustainable economic model, which means we need to deliver productivity quite regularly. And then it also includes a lot of what they want in terms of moving into hybrid cloud environments and taking advantage of the investments they've already made in their own systems plus getting the agility from us running their cloud.
So that services business, again, the demand profile I'd say looks more like that low single-digit kind of growth rate, which is evident in the backlog. And then we'll – again, given the transformative nature of some these deals, we'll sign them when they're ready and when they're complete.
In terms of margin on GBS, we've talked a fair bit about what we're going through with GBS. The only thing I'd add to the comments we've made is, again, we continue to see that the areas and the spaces we're moving to are more valuable as measured by gross profit margin, if you will. They're more valuable than where we're coming from, and so we see certainly a bright future. Now, it's just a matter of getting that weighting right and working our way through the transition and transformation of that, where we have a bit of a productivity impact as well.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Jim. Rowena, can we take the next question?
Operator
Yes ma'am, thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Could you just talk about the workforce transformation that you guys are implementing right now? What sort of gross savings are you guys targeting to get? I realize the net number may be fairly modest, but – just what sort of gross savings you think you can get, when does that start? And then the M&A contribution, can you just talk about what total revenues and strategic growth looks like on a organic basis, ex currency, ex M&A?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Amit. A couple of things. So on savings, if you will, and as you've pointed out, we're going to – we expect that we'll reinvest a lot of the savings as we start to realize them and as we start to achieve the savings. So in the prepared remarks and in the charts we've distributed, we've actually laid out quarter-by-quarter when we would expect to get about that $500 million or so of savings this year. And then we've also identified on a full year basis, that this frees up – for our spend rate, it frees up about $2 billion that we will now look to shift into these new areas. That's how we think about it. Again, this is not about capacity reduction; it's actually about moving into these new areas where we see new opportunities.
And then from a revenue perspective, as I covered in the prepared remarks, in the first quarter, the contribution from acquisitions in terms of revenue growth was under a point. Now, we've since closed Truven in April and we didn't have The Weather Company, for instance, in the full quarter, so we'll get a bit over a point as we go into the second. But we don't see – it's not adding 3 or 4 or 5 points here. It really is a point to 2 points as we go into the second in terms of acquisition contribution to revenue growth.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Amit. Can we take the next question please?
Operator
Yes ma'am, thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup. You may ask your question.
James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks very much. I was taking a look at your supplemental information on slide 20, and you discuss the signings down 17% year-over-year. And I understand that they're kind of lumpy. Could you address the service backlog, which was down 1% year-over-year, and help us understand how mathematically that number is adjusted for acquisitions that are coming in the year? Thank you.
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So, the first one or the second part of that, the acquisitions we're making are in things like software businesses. They are in as-a-service businesses. There's nothing in the backlog from acquisitions. So in the back-up information – and first, Jim, I do want to say, since we put so much time into all these backup charts, I do appreciate that someone's looking at them all, so thank you for that. In the services backlog of down 1%, there are really two components. One is, as I mentioned a couple of questions ago, the GTS component of that continues to grow about 1%, so think of it as low single-digit. And I think that's a good reflection of the demand environment for the kinds of services integrators that our GTS business is becoming.
The other piece of that is the GBS backlog, which is down 5%. So that down 1% is up 1% for GTS down 5%. And that's a reflection of our shift out of these large ERP implementations and the need for us to build some of these new businesses like Cognitive. So there's not a lot of, obviously, Cognitive signings in that backlog yet because we've created the practice within the last six months, and we're building the skill base and we're building the relationships with our clients. It's really those two dynamics. It's pretty good, stable growth – stable but growing in GTS and a decline in GBS as we shift into those new areas.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Okay, Rowena. Why don't we take one last question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Last question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes, thank you. Martin, you took the opportunity to invest at a higher rate given the tax refund to accelerate your transformation. How should investors think about that acceleration? Will you get to your goals and strategic imperatives revenue faster than 2018 because you're now investing at a higher pace and acquiring these skill sets, or perhaps throw off higher cash flow faster? And if accelerating the transformation is the right move, then why not like increase leverage and reinvest more aggressively for the remainder of the year as well instead of sort of waiting for the tax refund?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, a couple of things, Wamsi. So, we are investing quite aggressively here. And I run the deal committee. We have pretty active discussions still on what else we should acquire in order to build, again, new businesses, to extend the lead that we have in a business. So we'll keep doing that and we'll think prudently about where we deploy our capital.
Now, in terms of spend rates, as I mentioned, investments are shifting our workforce, if you will, investing are changing the way we operate. It's changing the way we engage with one another. So if the world created 5,000 cognitive experts, we would hire 5,000 cognitive experts. We already have, by the way, the largest private math department in the world, and so we are absorbing, if you will, the skills that we need for our business in order to drive these.
But there is a rate at which it doesn't make sense for us to keep putting money into these because the world doesn't create them any more. It's not a problem that can be solved by spending more money. It's a problem that is constrained by the kinds of skills the world's creating. So we have a global search on for talent. People come to IBM and we got about 1.2 million applications – applicants I should say. We've got more applications, but 1.2 million applicants. They come here in order to work with the leaders in their fields. What we find is that skills have gravity and highly skilled people want to work with others in their fields who are also highly skilled. So they come here to work with our unique data sets, with our unique technologies, with our unique industry expertise, in order to change the way the world works in order to change the way industries operate, in order to change professions. And we'll do that as fast as we can, but you can get a sense – I think we talked earlier, not in this call but in prior calls, that we hired 70,000 people last year out of the 1.2 million applicants. It takes a while to find the right people, so we'll invest as fast as the world creates the skills we need.
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So let me wrap up the call because we got a lot done in the quarter, and quite frankly I think we're pretty well positioned for the future. The new structure that we have been talking about which reflects our management system, we expect that it will facilitate our move to a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company, and it will also help our investors understand where we're making investments and where we seeing returns.
We introduced the structure just in February. We provided the history back in March as we said we would, and now it's the first quarter that we're reporting. So hopefully, with what we've done in this transition to this new reporting structure, you found all the information helpful and helped contextualize the results you're looking at and hopefully getting some insight into the businesses as we move through the transformation.
So thank you for joining the call, and we'll talk to you again in July.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. Let me start by saying we’re pleased with the progress we made again this quarter. We delivered revenue of $22.1 billion, operating net income of $4.7 billion, and operating earnings per share of $4.84. As we get in to our results, you’ll see that our fourth quarter and full year performance reflects the transitions in our business as we address the significant shifts in our industry, as well as some of the cyclical challenges of the global business environment.
So as always in January, I’ll start out with some comments on the year, show you the progress we’ve made in our transformation, discuss the details of the quarter, and then wrap up with our view of 2016. For the full year, we delivered nearly $82 billion of revenue, and $14.7 billion of operating net income and our operating earnings per share were $14.92. As we’ve said, this transformation will play out over time, and with revenue down 1%, for the second consecutive year we’ve had modest improvement in our year-to-year revenue performance, excluding the impact of currency and divestitures. I’ll comment on year-to-year revenue performance on this basis throughout.
Our strategic imperatives continued strong performance, up 26% for the year. This now represents 35% of IBM’s revenue. Our profit and margin reflect our portfolio actions as we shift to higher value, as well as the level of investments we’re making to drive our transformation. We generated over $13 billion of free cash flow, which is up year-to-year. This is 98% of our GAAP net income, in line with our expectation that free cash flow realization will be in the 90s.
A couple of years ago, we laid out our strategic imperatives around big data and analytics, around cloud, and around mobile and security, the areas where our clients are looking to us to help move them to the future. I want to spend a minute on the progress we’ve made since then in shifting our business toward these strategic imperatives, and in the investments we’ve been making, which aren’t yet reflected in our revenue streams. We have said, we expect these strategic imperatives to deliver double-digit revenue growth, and in 2015, our performance in our strategic imperatives accelerated.
Together, cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security grew 26% and delivered $29 billion in revenue. As I mentioned they now represent 35% of IBM, which is up from 22% two years ago. With 57% revenue growth over the last year, cloud is now a $10 billion business for us. This made us the largest cloud provider in 2015, which is what you’d expect, given our extensive relationships in enterprise IT and incumbency in the data center, positioning us to help our clients implement hybrid cloud environments.
Revenue from our as-a-Service offerings increased about 60% to $4.5 billion for the year, and we exited 2015 with an annual run rate for our as-a-Service business of $5.3 billion. The $10 billion also includes $5.6 billion of revenue from our foundational offerings where we provide software, hardware and services so clients can build their own clouds. In either case, what we’ve been saying for some time is that clients are utilizing a cloud not just to reduce costs, but to gain agility and enable innovation. And whether they’re consuming as-a-Service, or through their own clouds or as in the case of most enterprise clients who are implementing a hybrid environment, we’re leading that move.
To address opportunities we see in this space, in 2015 we made seven cloud acquisitions including Cleversafe for object storage, Gravitant for cloud brokerage services, and Clearleap for cloud video services. We also invested nearly a billion dollars in capital expanding our global cloud data center footprint to 46. We already have an ecosystem of millions of developers globally, and our Bluemix Platform-as-a-Service has already expanded to over a million users, adding 15,000 developers a week.
With nearly $18 billion of analytics revenue, we’re also the largest analytics provider, and we’ll extend that lead by moving into new areas including Watson Health and Watson Internet of Things. In Watson Health, we are integrating our own organic capabilities with content acquired through Merge, Phytel, and Explorys. Healthcare is a new revenue and profit opportunity for us as we change the face of healthcare through our cognitive platform to provide value to providers, payers, and partners. We’re also addressing the IoT market.
Our Weather Company acquisition not only gives us tremendously valuable data and digital content, but a high volume, cloud-based, insight-driven platform that we’ll integrate with Watson to address significant new opportunity spaces. We’ll talk about how we’re addressing these opportunities at our investor briefing at the end of February. And while we are investing in capabilities for the future, we’re also returning significant value to shareholders. We paid out nearly $5 billion in dividends, and we reduced our average share count by 2.7%.
So we got a lot done in 2015. To sum it up, our revenue for the year was down 1%, we expanded gross margin, we invested heavily for the future, and we returned capital to shareholders, all while transforming the business. The progress we’re making gives us confidence that we’re on the right strategy, and the actions we’ve taken not only advance our transformation, but also will contribute to our growth rate in the future. I’ll come back to the full year, and 2016 after going through the details of the quarter starting with the financial metrics.
Our revenue for the quarter of $22.1 billion was down 2%, reflecting the transition we’ve been describing. I’ll spend just a minute on currency, which continues to be a headwind. Currency impacted our reported revenue by over 6 points or $1.5 billion, which is about $350 million more than the spot rates suggested 90 days ago. For the year, currency translation reduced our revenue by over $7 billion. That by itself is the revenue of a Fortune 500 company and currency was also a headwind to our profit performance. We estimate it impacted our profit growth by about $300 million in the fourth quarter and over $1 billion for the year. At current spot rates, we would expect a significant impact to revenue and profit again in 2016 not just from the translation, but from the year-to-year cash flow hedging dynamics. I’ll come back to this.
Our margin performance reflects some ongoing dynamics in the business, like higher levels of investment, and an impact from the mix of contracts and resource shifts in our services business. But it also reflects some unique items in the fourth quarter of last year, the largest of which was $1.4 billion gain from the sale of our x86 server business. This prior period gain represents effectively all of the year-to-year decline in PTI margin. I’ll talk more about the margin drivers in the segment discussions.
Our underlying effective tax rate was 20%, and this quarter the rate also reflects the recent U.S. tax legislation, and the settlement of our U.S. tax audit, which we have talked about throughout 2015. And so bottom line, we delivered $4.84 of operating earnings per share. We generated over $6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and $13 billion for the year, and as I mentioned, this is 98% of GAAP net income. We returned about three quarters of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015 through dividends and gross share repurchases.
Now turning to the revenue by geography, we had good performance across many of the major markets. Europe returned to growth, led by continued growth in Germany, France, and the UK. In fact, Germany posted double-digit growth and in December, we announced Munich as the headquarters for our new Watson IoT business, as well as our first European Watson innovation center. In Asia Pacific, Japan continued to post growth, led by services.
In the AP growth markets, we had double-digit growth in India and Australia though China declined. Our U.S. revenue was down. We had strong growth in the U.S. in all hardware platforms – zSystems, Power, and storage, but it was offset by weak services and transactional software performance. The growth markets in total were down 4%, roughly in line with the last two quarters, and from a regional perspective, growth in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa was offset by declines in Asia Pacific.
Turning to the segment perspective, our total revenue was down 2%, and gross margin declined about a point. Our Global Technology Services revenue grew, as we help our clients transition to a hybrid cloud services platform bringing in more cloud, mobility and security to infrastructure services. This contributed to our backlog growth for the year. Our GTS gross margin decline is driven by investments in cloud data centers and the ramp of new contracts, which generally have lower up-front margins.
In Global Business Services, we’re adding resources and growing quickly in strategic areas, while transitioning away from some of the more traditional areas. This shift of resources impacts productivity in the near-term, which puts pressure on margin. In Software, our annuity content grew, but transactional performance has been impacted by the flexibility we’ve been providing in ELAs with our larger clients. The transactional performance in the fourth quarter was consistent with what we saw in September. But a larger transactional mix in the fourth quarter drove a deceleration in the overall software growth rate.
Our Systems Hardware revenue was up, driven by zSystems and Power. This caps a very strong year in our Systems business, reflecting that our leading edge servers run the most contemporary workloads. The Systems margin is driven by the lower mainframe margin, as is typical at this point in the cycle.
Turning to expense, our Operating Expense and Other Income is up 9%. There a few large items that impacted the growth rate this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the sale of our System X business in the fourth quarter of last year, resulting in a gain of $1.4 billion in that period. And this quarter we took a charge of about $85 million for the write-down of the equity component received as consideration.
So together, these were $1.5 billion year-to-year impact to our expense. We also had a year-to-year reduction in workforce rebalancing. We had $580 million of workforce rebalancing charges in the fourth quarter of last year, with essentially none this year, so this reduced expense growth by 10 points. And currency reduced expense growth by 8 points. Between the translation of non-dollar spending, and the cash flow hedging gains that are reported in other income and SG&A. This is pretty consistent with what we’ve seen all year.
Outside of these larger items, our expense dynamics have been consistent throughout the year. We’re accelerating shifts within our operational expense base driving productivity and efficiency in some areas, while increasing investment in support of our strategic imperatives. This year, we shifted $5 billion of spend to our strategic imperatives, that’s across cost, expense and capital expenditures.
Now let’s turn to the segments, and we’ll start with services. We ended the fourth quarter with a services backlog of $121 billion, which grew for the third consecutive quarter. We continue to see momentum in our services offerings that modernize our clients IT systems and move their operations into the cloud-based mobile world. We’ve seen reports that suggest the adoption of cloud it means shrinking deal sizes, but this is not what we are seeing. Clients are looking to transform their most critical systems into hybrid cloud environments, and the complexity of these partnerships in many cases results in larger engagements. 
In fact, this quarter we have signed 26 services deals greater than a $100 million, and for the full year we signed over 70 of these substantial transactions, which is 40% more than last year. So with a growing backlog and a 40% increase in large deals during the year, we are not seeing shrinking deals. Now about 70% of those transactions feature hybrid cloud content, which reflects both the value our clients see in hybrid, and the reality that not all of their workloads will be optimized for the cloud. 
Just recently, we signed a $1.4 billion expansion in the scope of our relationship with European Bank BNP Paribas. This is a joint GBS and GTS engagement, and as part of the agreement, we'll operate two of the bank's data centers in Belgium as hybrid cloud centers, providing cloud infrastructure and a full suite of business transformation services spanning applications testing, business intelligence, security and core banking solutions.
Global Technology Services delivered $8.1 billion of revenue, and grew for the third consecutive quarter. 
Our strategic imperatives including our hybrid cloud services in GTS grew strong double digits this quarter, and for the full year. This includes strong demand for Softlayer, which again grew double digits this quarter. This Infrastructure-as-a- Service cloud platform provides our clients with a full range of cloud services including virtual and bare metal servers along with a dedicated dark fiber network infrastructure. As clients evaluate their technology roadmap, they are looking for agility and innovation and to gain insight into data from all sources. 
Our hybrid cloud stack is an open platform that enables this innovation. Our clients can choose from public, private, and dedicated environments based on their needs, such as workload, performance, data sovereignty, and regulatory requirements. Entire industries and value chains are being disrupted, and our clients are looking to us for competitive advantage.
To expand our Cloud capabilities, this past quarter we announced the acquisition of Gravitant. Gravitant develops cloud-based software to enable organizations to easily broker software and computing services across multiple suppliers and cloud environments from a single screen.
We also announced the acquisition of Clearleap, a premier provider of cloud-based video services. This will provide our enterprises with a fast and easy way to securely manage, monetize, and grow user video experiences. The Clearleap video platform is optimized for massive scalability, which enables clients to ramp up and support millions of concurrent users within seconds to support special events. The innovations have attracted leading brands such as HBO, A&E Networks, the NFL, and Sony Movie Channel.
Finally, our maintenance business continues to contribute significant revenue and profit by delivering a wide range of support services to maintain and improve our clients’ IT infrastructure. We continue to see strong demand for our Multi-Vendor Support services where clients can leverage our global distribution and inventory capabilities.
Our GTS PTI margin is up about two points year to year. This was driven by lower workforce rebalancing charges and savings from actions taken throughout the year to drive efficiency in our delivery model. Mitigating these savings, we continue to invest to contemporize our clients IT systems, transforming them into digital enterprises. We’re scaling our Softlayer footprint with 46 cloud data centers opened around the world. 
Finally, as we’ve talked about throughout the year, currency is impacting margin, and remains the largest impact on year-to-year profit growth given the strong dollar environment. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.3 billion in the quarter. We continue to transform our GBS business, and our signings were up double digits this quarter driven by our digital offerings. Revenue from our strategic imperative practices was again up strong double digits. 
Our analytics practice grew over 20%, our cloud services were up over 60%, and our mobile practice more than doubled. Our revenue continues to be impacted by the wind down of traditional enterprise application implementations. Clients are moving away from ERP engagements to initiatives that focus on digitizing their business with analytics, cloud, and mobile technologies.
In December we announced that as part of our partnership with Apple, we’ve now delivered over 100 MobileFirst for iOS applications. This unique partnership brings together the simplicity of design and ease of use of the Apple mobile device, with our ability to build applications that scale securely and efficiently to the enterprise helping to transform the way work gets done across 14 industries and 65 professions. These apps allow our clients to securely access their most critical data and processes, so that they can redesign workflows and drive productivity. Since we announced the partnership with Apple, we’ve generated over $1 billion in signings from the program.
GBS profit margin was flat year to year. Let me talk about some of the dynamics within that. We have a benefit from lower workforce rebalancing charges. In parts of the portfolio where the market is declining, we are seeing price and profit pressure and we are taking actions to optimize our cost structure. We continue to invest in our analytics, cloud, and mobility practices. 
We’ve hired and shifted significant resources to these areas, which impacts productivity and margin in the near term. We are also scaling a new cognitive consulting practice launched last quarter that is focused on helping our clients unlock the transformative value of cognitive business.
Our Software revenue was $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter. Our annuity content grew year to year, while transactional content declined. Our Software profit performance continues to reflect the revenue trajectory, a higher level of investments in areas like Watson, Watson Health, IoT and Bluemix, and an impact from currency translation
Let me spend a minute on the revenue dynamics. Looking at the transactional content, recalling our last earnings call, we talked about weaker transactional performance at the end of September, which impacted the third quarter. Our fourth quarter transactional performance was very similar to what we experienced in September. Given the much higher transactional mix in the fourth quarter, this had a larger impact on our total software performance, resulting in a deceleration in software growth in the fourth. 
Looking ahead to first quarter, which has a lower transactional mix, we will see an improvement in our revenue trajectory. We’ve said in the past that our performance reflects that many of our large clients with multi-year contracts are utilizing the flexibility on deployment of their software, as they build out their environments with our broad portfolio, and this is continuing. Outside of our top 250 clients our software revenue was up low single digits in the fourth quarter, and for the full year.
On an annual basis, about 70% of our software business is annuity-like, including Software-as-a-Service, and subscription and support. Our renewal rates are steady, our SaaS business is growing, and our overall annuity revenue grew in the fourth quarter and the full year.
Middleware serves the purpose of integrating different environments – on prem, and cloud. To enable hybrid environments, our key capabilities have now been delivered on Softlayer, or as part of our IBM Bluemix platform. IBM’s middleware remains the number one integration platform in the world, and now integrates across cloud environments. 
To put it simply, this allows clients’ existing apps to access the cloud, and new “born on the cloud” applications to access clients’ existing assets. To accelerate the integration of middleware in a hybrid cloud environment, we made an organizational change at the beginning of this year, moving a portion of our middleware business into our cloud business, reflecting the importance of our middleware in the hybrid cloud marketplace.
We are also adding substantial new capabilities into our software and solutions portfolio. One example is the Weather Company acquisition, which will provide the basis for our IoT platform. This acquisition brings with it a high-volume platform that can ingest sensor data at scale. This platform can handle enormous complexity, taking in four billion weather forecasting points and 26 billion queries in its cloud service each day. This is the fourth most-used mobile app, handling seven times more transaction volume than the world’s leading search engine. Some of this has been running on our cloud already and of course we will move all of this to IBM cloud. 
And then we will layer in Watson to give it the cognitive capability to apply machine learning at scale. This then gives us the ability to expand this platform capability to industries beyond weather, like health. The power of the platform is its ability to use Watson cognitive capabilities to gather new insights by connecting data at scale from multiple industry domains.
Our Systems Hardware segment revenue was $2.4 billion. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in both z Systems and Power. We have continued to deliver innovation to our systems to enable them to run the most contemporary workloads. In fact, about half of our systems segment revenue in 2015 was to address analytics workloads, or hybrid and private clouds.
This quarter z Systems revenue was up more than 20%. Since the launch of z13 in the first quarter of 2015, we have delivered growth of 35%, with strong double-digit growth in every quarter since the launch. z13 was contemporized for the workloads around mobile, hybrid cloud and analytics, which continues to resonate well with our existing customers, and bringing new customers to the platform. For the year we added 50 new clients across 25 countries.
Power revenue grew 8%, which is the strongest performance of the year. In Power we are serving a high value market, while adding capabilities and finding new economic models to grow over time. Unix is a declining market, but we continue to address it because it is very a high value space. At the same time, we introduced low-end Linux-based Power systems to capture the growing Linux market, and are building an IP stream through the OpenPOWER ecosystem. Even though the Unix market is declining, by delivering innovation and repositioning the platform, our Power systems have grown four quarters in a row. This is a good example of how we transform ourselves.
The growth in our servers was mitigated by a 7% decline in Storage hardware, which continues to be impacted by weakness in traditional disk and tape. As we have said, value in the storage market continues to shift to software and offering requirements that are driving demand for flash and object-based storage. We are well-positioned in these new areas, with growth in flash, and our recent acquisition of Cleversafe.
Looking back at 2015, our Systems results reflect a successful transformation and repositioning of the business. Revenue was up 8% for the year, and profit up about $600 million. This performance reflects our solid mainframe product cycle and the successful Power transformation, with Power revenue growing for the first time since 2011.
So moving on to cash flow, in the quarter, we generated $7.1 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. We invested $1 billion dollars in CapEx, and generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow.
For the full year, we generated $17 billion of cash from operations. We invested almost $4 billion in CapEx this year, with a significant amount going to support our growing services backlog, and for cloud as we build out cloud data centers. And so we generated free cash flow of $13.1 billion, an improvement of almost $700 million year to year. The primary driver of this improvement was lower cash tax payments of about $3 billion. 
Our cash and tax book rates for 2015 were fairly consistent, and so the year-to-year benefit to cash flow was driven by a much higher cash tax rate in 2014. We also had over a $1 billion of improvement in our sales cycle working capital. This was partially offset by a decline in our profit performance, and payments of performance-based compensation.
Looking at uses of cash, we’ve invested over $3 billion on acquisitions this year. We’ve acquired 14 companies, including seven in the fourth quarter. The Weather Company acquisition I mentioned earlier will close in the first half of 2016.
Over the course of the year we’ve returned $9.5 billion to shareholders including dividends of nearly $5 billion and $4.6 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back 30 million shares, reducing our average share count by 2.7%. At the end of the year, we had $5.6 billion remaining in our buy back authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.2 billion. Total debt was nearly $40 billion, of which $27 billion was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains just over seven to one. The credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 55% investment grade; you can see this in our supplemental charts. The year-to-year reduction in investment grade was driven by rating changes to our existing portfolio, not by changing our approach to the market.
Our non-financing debt of $12.7 billion was almost a $1 billion lower than September, and up just over $1 billion year-to-year. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was 54%, four points lower than September, and five points lower than a year ago. Our debt-to-cap ratio was impacted again this year by a reduction in equity due to currency translation, and pension re-measurement. Together, these impacted our equity by about $3.5 billion. The performance of our retirement-related assets, and return and discount rate assumptions at year-end are in our supplemental charts. You can see our funding levels remain solid with the U.S. and worldwide tax-qualified plans at 101% and 97% respectively. And importantly, our balance sheet continues to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term.
So now let me wrap up where I started the call by saying that we’re pleased with the progress that we made again this year in the transformation of our business. We’re continuing to invest and add capabilities to drive the transformation. In 2015, we spent over 6% of our revenue in R&D, we invested about $4 billion in capital, and over $3 billion to acquire 14 companies. We are integrating acquired content with our organic capabilities, and leveraging partnerships and a broader ecosystem to build new high value platforms. And we’re applying our cognitive capabilities to more of what we do.
Within our spend, we’re shifting to key opportunity areas, and we’re seeing the returns in our strategic imperatives results. With $29 billion of revenue, these now make up 35% of IBM. In 2015, we had a successful mainframe cycle, and Power grew as we repositioned it to address a broader opportunity. Our services backlog was up and we exited the year with a $121 billion book of business. Our software annuity base, which is about 70% of our software revenue also continued to grow. Our overall Software performance reflects reduced transactional levels as our largest customers utilize flexibility we’ve provided and commit to our platform for the longer term.
The macro environment, as always, is mixed, and currency continues to be a significant headwind. While we are focused on remaining competitive in local markets, the translation impact is significant. It was an 8 point impact to revenue growth in 2015, and at current spot rates, currency would be another 2 to 3 point impact this year. The profit impact is substantial as well, and given the sustained period of dollar strengthening, the profit impact in 2016 will in fact be greater than 2015, both because of the translation impact, and the roll-off effect of cash flow hedging gains. At current spot rates, we expect currency to impact pre-tax profit growth in 2016 by about $1.3 billion with nearly three quarters of that coming from a year-to-year reduction in cash flow hedging gains.
So now as we look forward to 2016, we’ll continue to deliver strong growth in our strategic imperatives. We expect some modest expansion in gross margin, and will continue to invest at high levels. And we’ll continue to return value to shareholders,
through share repurchases and dividends.
Taking all of this into consideration, we expect Operating EPS of at least $13.50. This reflects an impact from currency of over a dollar of EPS, which is about a seven and a half point impact to the growth rate. Our free cash flow will follow our profit performance, and we continue to see our free cash flow realization in the nineties.
Looking at the quarterly skew, as you know the first quarter represents the smallest quarter in terms of contribution to our full year earnings. At this point in prior years our first quarter view has been from 14% of the full year to a few points higher than that. Given the magnitude of the currency headwind and the skew of our investments this year, we would expect the first quarter of 2016 to come in at about 15% of the $13.50.
Bottom line, we remain confident in our strategy, and in our ability to execute. And we look forward to continued progress in our transformation in 2016.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and year. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.
Operator, let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we will begin to question-and-answer session of the conference.[Operator Instructions] First question is from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Sir, you may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes, good afternoon, Martin. When you began 2015 you talked about software as really being kind of the pivot for whether you might hit the high end of your guidance range to the low end of your guidance range. And you anticipated or hoped that software would improve in the second half. What we saw was the opposite is that software decelerated significantly in the second half of this year. And I’m wondering, if you could reflect on: A) what happened and B) while there should be some improvement next quarter because of less transaction and I gather the weather channel will be added into that division.
How do we think about software in 2016, should we be expecting a business that’s down low single-digit at constant currency again? And perhaps you can talk about kind of the forces that play both again what happened in terms of deterioration in the second half and how we should think about the forces that play in 2016? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure thank you, thanks Toni. A few comments on software, so as we said in our prepared remarks, the deceleration third to fourth really was driven by this – by the mix shift and the continuation of the transaction closing rates that we saw in September. So we talked about – coming out of September we talked about a slower rate of closing in some of our larger deals and that’s what we experienced as well in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, because of the mix shift alone we see an improvement and as you point out the weather company another acquisitions by the way to the extent that they are – have software in them they will obviously bolster that growth rate.
A few things, I think are important to note within software. First, as we said in our prepared remarks and the phenomena is really no different in the fourth and what we’ve seen all year, our annuity business within the software business. So that’s about 70% of our overall software stream. Our annuity business continues to grow. So that has a service in it, it has our subscription and support business in it as well, so that continues to grow.
And then outside of our largest clients and this is a phenomena that we’ve been talking about, outside of our largest clients where they don’t have as broad access to our software portfolio, we continue to see growth as well, both transactionally and they’re obviously part of the asset service stream. Within the large clients as I mentioned earlier and as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we provide flexibility, it gives them – it gives our clients an ability now to manage their projects and they deploy maybe differently than they anticipated at the beginning of the year. From my discussions with our clients, a lot of that depends on the visibility they have both of their demand patterns and the visibility they have to sort of the – kinds of projects they might have to implement in the near-term.
So I don’t think that’s any different than what we’ve experienced in the past. I would say that one of the things we look at closely, particularly with regard to the usage of our software and how it’s getting deployed, is our ability to maintain these renewal rates on our subscription and support. And our renewal rates around the world remain very high in the mid-90s globally. And if we look in the U.S. where we had a weaker software transactional performance, actually our renewal rates in the U.S. are even higher than that, they are higher than they are in Japan, they are higher than they are in Europe, they are higher than they are in Australia. So our renewal rates continue in a very good track and that suggests that our annuity business within software has some good growth prospects.
But as we said in our prepared remarks again, just from the mix benefit of having more of that annuity mix in the first quarter, we will see an improvement. And then as you noted the acquisitions will sit on top of that.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. We can go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Katy, you may ask your question.
Katy Huberty
On a high note in servers both mainframe and power, how are you thinking about growth rates in 2016 as you move into the latter half of the cycle and how might that influence gross margins? It looks like it had an intact to the fourth quarter? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Your question actually cut off a little bit. I think you said, finishing at a high note in the fourth quarter, I’m going to assume that was the question, Katy. So, I’ll answer for mainframe and for power and how we’re entering 2016.
So first on mainframe, another very good cycle in mainframe, so as you know we announced that in the first quarter, the growth rates have been pretty consistent throughout, that we doubled in the first, growth in the second, good third quarter, again fourth quarter we finished at about 20% year-to-year of constant currency. And the adoption rates are consistent with what we would expect.
So for the full year the mainframe is up 35%. And as is typical in the mainframe cycle, margins in the announcement year tend to be a little bit lower. And we will see margin improvement as we get to the latter half of the – or the latter part of the mainframe cycle in 2016. From a power perspective, well I’ll tell you, the power team has done a wonderful job of transforming a business. And I think it’s a really good example of how IBM transforms its businesses.
So since as we put in the prepared remarks we have not grown since 2011 and in 2015, we grew each of the four quarters in the power business, finishing the fourth at plus eight. And I think what’s underpins that and what’s important to note is we continue to serve a decline in market for part of that Power business, the UNIX market is declining, it has been declining, but it’s still high value and it’s still serves a very important role in our clients environment and does some other most important works. So it – continues to be an important market place.
But at the same time, the team has been able to reinvent the platform, make it relevant in the Linux space so we’re seeing very good Linux placements in Power and the applicability of that POWER8 platform in Cloud spaces for instance and running other ERP type missions has been a terrific boost to the overall growth rates.
And then keep in mind that we’ve also – the team is also put in play from a business model perspective, the OpenPOWER Foundation, which is an intellectual property play. So that will also boost margins. So the Power, again the Power team has done a terrific job of repositioning a product which had a very strong acceptance and that’s delivering high value in a declining market space into now a business that has grown four quarters in a row with a lot of leverage from here as our OpenPower consortium members start to deliver their own systems into that Linux space.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy. Rovena, can we go to the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.
Tien-tsin Huang
Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask on services if we can expect some improvement in growth in 2015 given the backlog chime you talked about that Martin. And also your confidence in services margin, expansion in 2016, because, if I heard correctly, no workforces were down saying in the fourth quarter. Is that a signal that you’re on a good place with your offshore delivery right-sizing? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Thanks Tien-tsin. So a couple of comments and I’ll disaggregate, I guess I’ll talk about GTS and GBS separately. So first, we did, as we said in our prepared remarks, we finished with a very good backlog growth of 1% ex-currency. Now that is $121 billion book of business. So even, 1% growth is a lot of additional business that we feel quite good about the backlog, we’re entering with – and even when we look at the signings progress throughout the year, for the full year GTS, global technology services grew signings and GBS grew signings and in fact GBS exited fourth quarter with double-digit signings growth in the quarter. So a very strong return to growth which put them into growth for the year, so from a backlog perspective and from a relevance of our offerings perspective, I think those signings numbers suggest that there are substantial deals out there, there are deals that play well to – our high value view and our ability to move our clients into hybrid environment and our ability to continue to grow – to continue to grow that backlog.
From a margin perspective in GTS, keep in mind that at a total GTS level we have very good margins. But we also have a maintenance business in there which has a lot of margin within it. When you pull out the maintenance margin and just look at DSO business, we still see opportunities to expand margins in that area. And keep in mind, with regard to workforce rebalancing while we didn't have a charge in the fourth. We’ll continue to remix our skills and we'll continue to move our work to where global delivery centers can best do it. So that will not be a year-to-year impact in the first quarter. But we will continue to remix skills and so as we bring on new contractors as an example and we've seen a lot of contract growth in Europe, we've seen a lot of contract growth in Asia. We will have an opportunity, we do have an opportunity to continue to expand our margins as we globalize some of that work.
Our movement of work into global delivery centers, it varies by geography and quite frankly its varies by country. In the U.S. we were in pretty good – we are in a pretty good spot here but where we sign new contracts obviously we take on a lot of people and we've got to figure out how do we optimize those delivery platforms. And then in GTS as we've talked about we continue to work our way through a transformation towards higher value and what we see from the margin perspective is that the work we're doing to digitize our clients front office the work we're doing to provide a cognitive solution to our clients which is just starting now to roll into our consulting results.
That is all high margin and we see a lot of opportunity continue to generate those kinds of margins. In the work we're transitioning out of, that is pretty price competitive and then and so we're seeing declining margins but more importantly as we shift the resources and as we move those skills there is a productivity hit to the overall business. So we're not relying on a dramatic net back if you will and our GBS margins going into the year but we do see a very good opportunity on the other side as we finish that transition.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tien-tsin. Let's go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Brian White from Drexel. Sir, you may ask your question.
Brian White
Yes, Martin, if we look at the different business segments in 2016, what businesses do you think have an opportunity to actually grow in constant currency and what businesses have an opportunity to expand margins in 2016? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Brian thanks. So a few comments, I think what we're going to see in 2016 is really the phenomena that we’ve been talking about now for a couple of years which is our clients are investing heavily in these growing areas of cloud of analytics, of mobile, social and security and as you saw in the full year of 2015, we grew that 26%, right now it’s 35% of our business. So our client discussions today are still built around those that shift into those parts of the business.
We’ll also see a continued discussion around parts of a business where they’re focused on us delivering productivity to them, now productivity to your clients means reduced revenues for us, but that’s the phenomena we’ve been in. And so when we look at 2016, I think we'll see a continuation of both of those. As you know in 2015, we ended the year with a revenue base it was about 1% smaller than it was the prior year given those two dynamics strong growth in the strategic imperatives and delivering productivity to our clients in the rest.
So that probably – that trend is what we’re going to see now the mix obviously be different the strategic imperatives are representing a larger part of the business than they did in then where they started in 2015, but that trend will continue. On a segment-by-segment basis, GTS has grown now three quarters of the year and as I said with pretty good backlog growth and we think that trajectory continues to hold.
GBS improved in the fourth, relative to the third, so a sequential improvement in its year-to-year growth rate. But we’re not relying on that bouncing back rapidly as we know we’re going through a transition there, and we want to get through that transition as rapidly as possible. But having said that, about half of their business now is in strategic imperatives, but half isn’t so we’re going to continue that transition.
The systems business will continue to see momentum as I mentioned in the power business where the team has done a terrific job of repositioning the platform. But the mainframe is coming into the back half of the cycle and so we won’t see the same growth levels that we saw. And then software as I mentioned in response to the prior question that transactional mix will not play as bigger role in the first quarter as it did in the fourth and so obviously we’ll see how we transition through the year, but bolstering that software growth will also be some of the acquisitions.
So I think there are discussions with our clients, as I started with the discussions with our clients are going to reflect these two halves of our business which is discussions around moving to the future and the other discussion are helping them drive productivity.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Brian. Rovena, can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Sure, Ma’am. Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Sir, you may ask your question
Steve Milunovich
Great, thank you. Could you talk a bit about free cash flow you said free cash flow will follow profit. Does that literally mean you expect about $13.50 in free cash flow per share? I would think maybe not given that you had a $3 billion positive swing on the cash taxes and maybe you could go through cash taxes, pension, working capital, CapEx, some of the swing factors and where you think that I’ll come out on free cash flow this year.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Steve, and you’re right. We – what my reported remarks or my remarks we’re not intended to say, we’re going to do $13.50 in free cash flow per share. That was not the intent. But what I – we do want to say is that our free cash flow performance in absolute terms will follow the profit performance. So a few comments, first we did have a year-to-year reduction in our cash taxes. But keep in mind that in 2015 our cash tax rate and our book rate were pretty similar.
And so the relationship you see in 2015 is the right relationship, yes, year-to-year there was a benefit, but that’s because we had a very high cash tax rate in 2014. So the 2015 relationship, which we – where we produced 98% of our debt net income was the realization per free cash flow is the one we’re talking about for 2016 as well we see that relationship. Now within that – the guidance that $13.50 – at least $13.50 we translate the free cash flow kind of in the $11 billion to $12 billion range.
And within that we have assumed some growth in CapEx for the year, as we continue to drive our cloud platform and our investments in there and our system, our services business. The operational performance that’s embedded within that obviously will have an impact. Then the rest and I’ll give you a few pluses and minuses here. The rest kind of translates to basically flat. So really is the profit performance. So we’ll have slightly higher income tax payments as an example.
We’ll have a less – a little bit of a less benefit of working capital. We have slightly lower pension payments, we have slightly lower workforce rebalancing payments assume. So you put all that together and what I meant by free cash flow will follow profit is that free cash flow at $11 billion to $12 billion of free cash flow roughly translates to what we see in profit performance at that at least number.
Bear in mind that, as we talked about on profit. There’s about $1.3 billion impact of profit year-to-year from currency. And while the dynamics are a little bit different in cash flow that does translate roughly to the impact to free cash flow as well. So what you’re seeing in here in our guidance, which was a big impact from currency, is also a big impact in free cash flow for next year.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Steve. Rovena, can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman from Stifel Financial. You may ask your question sir.
David Grossman
Thank you. So Martin, if I read the press release right, it said the strategic imperatives decelerated through about 16% growth year-over-year at constant currency. That’s obviously down from where you were in the first three quarters. What were the primary components driving the deceleration? And what would be a reasonable target for growth in those strategic imperatives in 2016?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks, David. So a couple of things, as we said for the year we were at – we had very good growth of $29 billion. What we saw in the quarter was about $1.7 billion sequential increase in strategic imperative revenue. And that’s better than it was first to second, better than second to third. So we did see kind of a typical seasonal sequential improvement in our strategic imperatives from third to fourth. When we talk about our strategic imperatives at Investor Day, we said they’ve been growing kind of in this uncanny rate of 18, 18, 19, 19, 19 very steady over the last few years. And we said that our model assumes that we will transition to those areas at a similar kind of rates, I think we had 15 to 19, think of it as high-teens if you will.
As we went through this year and as we said at the beginning, first quarter we printed over 30, and as we said we’re not relying on that throughout the year. So we finished the year on a full-year basis, now relative to that 15 to 19 range, where we finished at 26% growth year-to-year. So we’re ahead of what we expected. We’re transitioning into those areas faster than we had expected back at Investor Day. And so we finished at 35% of the revenue streams. And again in Investor Day, we said by 2018 we get to about 40 or at least 40.
We think we’re in good shape to make it there, but 26, we’re pleased with, because we’re transitioning faster than we have over the last four years or five years. And again, it’s on a higher base. So we’re pleased with the progress we’re making and continuing to grow these strategic imperatives.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Can we go to next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
Martin Schroeter
Jim, we can’t hear you if you are on mute.
James Schneider
Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me now?
Martin Schroeter
Yes.
Patricia Murphy
We can.
James Schneider
Okay, sorry. Just in terms of the software performance during the quarter, can you maybe talk about the impact and quantify the impact you saw from the ELA, because there is no weakness in Q4. And then can you maybe give us some kind of bracketing for 2016 about what impact you expect from ELAs to the extent you can see it going forward over the next couple of quarters?
Martin Schroeter
Well, sure, Jim. So a few things, one, and I’m not saying you implied this, but ELAs are very – ELAs are Enterprise License Agreements for all of our listeners. ELAs, Enterprise License Agreements are very powerful – a very powerful way for our clients to consume our software, gives them broad access to the portfolio we offer like our middleware platform, which is quite valuable to them as they think about their hybrid cloud environment.
So we do more ELAs, more Enterprise License Agreements, we did more in 2015 and we did in 2014. We haven’t seen a dramatic change in the length of time our clients commit to the platform for those. As I mentioned on an earlier question, our renewal rates for the subscription and support that underpins their deployment of those continues at very high rates.
So the ELA structure is one that we think is – and our client think as a terrific way to consume our portfolio. Now parts of our portfolio will continue to – will continue to be consumed on an EL basis – ELA basis. And as you saw us, maybe you saw us, earlier this year we moved parts of our middleware portfolio into our cloud business. That’s really a reflection of the importance our middleware places in these hybrid cloud environment. So some of that could get start to get consumed in different models from ELAs that – maybe they get consumed on a more individual basis, maybe they get consumed on an as-a-Service basis, but the ELA construct remains quite powerful.
As I noted earlier, the big difference we saw was in the breath of the access that some of our clients have and they – because they don’t have the visibility they need to their demand environment or because they don’t have visibility to the most immediate need they might have, they’ll move around the deployment of those licenses into different areas. But again with our renewal right staying high, we know that they are still consuming those. So the ELA construct quite powerful. It’s the right way I think for our clients to consume our software and the right way to give them flexibility to deploy it.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Jim. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia from CLSA. You may now ask your question.
Lou Miscioscia
Hey thanks. Hey, Martin, Lou here. So just sticking on the software, if you go back to the second half of 2014 when the flexible pricing started to hit software growth in a meaningful way and then obviously it hit it all through 2015, when are we going to get the grandfathering position where we can get half the flexible price in which – I know that when we talked about this before you’ve said that it was the right thing to do for the customer. But customers want everything for free and I assume you are not trying to move through an open source type of model. So I’m just wondering when we can get passed and what else you can do to try to get software growth in your most profitable area in the company?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Louis. So a couple of things that I’d say. First, this is the right thing to do to offer our clients flexibility as they try to get insights into their demand environments and as they try to deploy their projects. So it is absolutely the right thing to do. We felt that way when we started talking about, and I think it’s still the right thing to do.
Again, what’s important to us is that they commit to the platform, number one. Number two that they are actually deploying the software and we see that as I mentioned in our renewal rates where as long as our renewal rates are staying high we know they’re using our software. So all of that is good for the model. And in the long-term, we think that we will benefit from all this. Now, bolstering our software growth this year and our software performance this year will be some acquisitions we made, so those will certainly help as we go through the year, but this is – again, it’s the right thing to do for our clients.
And as we continue to move our software into a broader and broader ecosystem, we’ll continue to see growth in those clients that that don’t have access to so much, so that will continue. But from an overall perspective with the acquisitions, which will help a bit, and again our renewal rates staying high. Over the long-term, this is a terrific business for us.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks. We’ll go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Sir, you may ask your question.
Keith Bachman
Hi, many thanks. I also wanted to focus on the software area. I think on the last call you mentioned that Software-as-a-Service was a small part of your existing portfolio, I think around 5% of revenues. As you think about 2016, could you address how you see the growth of as-a-Service impacting your software both revenue growth and profitability? And more specifically, I don’t think we’ve gotten a specific answer on can you grow software in 2016 and will your margins be up down or flat? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Keith. So, a few things. So, our SaaS revenue overall as a percentage of our total software business is still fairly small percentage, but it is growing and is growing quite well and we are always releasing new SaaS and acquiring new SaaS opportunities. So we see continued very strong growth in our SaaS portfolio into 2016. Now, it’s small and so relative to the total, it’s not going to drive a ton at the top-line, but over the long-term this will be a good economic model for IBM.
Additionally, the new businesses we’re building have this strong SaaS component or as-a-Service component to them. So, Watson for instance is an as-a-Service offering. Our new Watson Health business has built heavily on an as-a-Service offerings. And other as well are moving into much more heavily weighted to our as-a-Service. So the as-a-Service fees, which is part of our overall as-a-Service exit run rate $5.3 billion has pretty good growth in it. In terms of profitability, we talked in our prepared remarks about continued margin expansion in 2016. And part of that quite frankly is going to be driven by additional volumes on our as-a-Service platform, that’s both Software-as-a-Service, infrastructure-as-a-service and our platform-as-a-service, our Bluemix property.
So we will see as those revenues climb, we will see profitability in fact margin expansion out of those – excuse me as-a-Service properties. Within SaaS specifically, our margins and software are quite high while the move into a SaaS model is not accretive to margins in software. It’s not a big impact and it is accretive to margins and total IBM because we don’t have a lot of these SaaS properties. So, in 2016, we see margin improvements across our as-a-Service properties. Margins within SaaS specifically are accretive to IBM and we see that continue in 2016.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thanks. Rovena, can we please take one last question?
Operator
Yes, ma’am. Thank you. Our last question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, you may ask your question.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks. Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess – Martin just in the strategic imperatives revenue stream that you guys have, you absolutely have a fair bit of scale over the margin right now, especially in Analytics and Cloud. Can you explain and talk about what do you think the margin and the free cash flow profile of the strategic imperatives assets is versus overall IBM, I think that would be helpful for people to understand? And then is the mix of strategic imperatives, software service and hardware change a whole lot from the last analyst have you guys talked about it?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Amit, a few things. I will answer the strategic imperative revenue part of your non-multipart question first. So on the strategic imperative revenue, I guess, the margin profile of that for the bulk of that business, which is focused on again Cloud or on our Analytics business, for a lot of that it just looks like our existing margin profile. So, where we’re selling our hardware, where we’re selling our software in for our clients to build an Analytic solution or for them to build their own Cloud then the margin profile looks like IBM’s.
And as you know IBM is a high margin solution company. For the as-a-Service component of that, the margins are a little bit lower than that. Now a lot of that is because we don’t yet have the scale that we’d like or is it’s that differently we’re investing very heavily in order to drive that platform into our clients’ environment. And so, we’ll see margin improvement as we go into 2016 as we add more scale or take advantage if you will of the investments we have made. So in total the strategic imperative revenue over time will not have a dramatically different margin profile than what we see today. Again, because most of it has what is our margin profile today and the rest will continue to improve margins as our investment rates or as our revenue growth rates meet up and the capacity meets up with the investment rates.
Relative to the mix, our software mix within our strategic imperatives is still at about twice as high as the rest, if you will, the rest of the business. So as you know in across services, hardware and software, if you look at the mix of those, the software piece in the strategic imperatives twice as high as what we see in the rest of the business. Now, it is down a little bit year-to-year as we in any given year or any given quarter, we have a different mix. We have certain programs that roll in, but it remains on – in total at about twice as high a mix as what we have in our core business. Thanks, Amit.
Martin Schroeter
So let me just wrap up the call with a couple of comments, first, and I think we have been clear about this. We manage our business for the long-term. And in 2015, we made a lot of progress, a lot of very good progress in transforming the IBM company. You see this not only in the growth rate in the strategic imperatives, but importantly you see it in the big steps we’ve taken to address some of these new opportunities. We had an opportunity last year to invest quite a bit of capital. We bought 14 companies. We will continue to be acquisitive.
So with the returns we’re seeing on our investments, we are more and more encouraged that the strategy is right and that we’re executing to transform IBM. In 2016, we’ll have our Investor Day in February. We’re going to talk more about both the transformation of IBM. We’re going to talk about how we present their information to the financial community to help understand IBM, particularly as we emerge as a cognitive solutions and Cloud platform company. I think it’s very important to understand what IBM is emerging as and again we’ll talk about that in our Investor Day.
So, thank you very much for joining the call today, and we’ll see you in February.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. In the second quarter, we delivered $19.3 billion of revenue, operating pretax income of over $3 billion, operating earnings per share of $2.97, and free cash flow of over $2.5 billion. The quarter played out as we expected with continued solid growth in our strategic imperatives which now really reflects organic growth. We wrapped on the acquisitive content and we're at the stage where we can start to get some efficiency as a result of bringing them into IBM while we build on the new content.
Our gross margin is up over 2.5 point sequentially and positions us for the continued improvement over the course of the year we talked about 90 days ago. And we had good free cash flow performance all again as we expected. In the second quarter we signed a number of large contracts in global technology services and again, grew our global business services signings, both of which will start to contribute in the second half. And since the quarter ended, we announced our new IBM Z system which will be available later this quarter. With all of this we expect improved performance in revenue and gross margin in the second half and we continue to expect at least $13.80 of operating EPS and free cash flow consistent with last year.
I'll spend time on the first to second half dynamics a little later and you will see it's very similar to what we talked about in April. We've been focused on helping our enterprise clients transform their businesses to leverage their data for competitive advantage and to improve the efficiency and agility of their IT environments. Our strategic imperatives performance has been an indication of our progress in moving to these areas. As you know, our strategic imperatives are in separate businesses but signpost that represent the revenue across our business lines that work together to address demand for analytics, cloud security, mobile and social. Our clients are taking the productivity savings we're delivering to them in the more traditional areas of IT and reinvesting those savings to move into these new areas; these are the dynamics you've seen in our revenue.
In the quarter, our strategic imperatives revenue was up 7% at constant currency which as I said is pretty much all organic growth. Over the last twelve months, revenue from our strategic imperatives was up 12% to over $34 billion and now represents 43% of IBM. As is typical, I'll focus on constant currency growth rates throughout. A large part of our strategic imperatives are delivered as a service. Our as a service revenue was up over 30% in the second, and we exited the quarter with an $8.8 billion annual run rate. IBM's cloud revenue on a trailing twelve month basis is now over $15 billion, that's nearly 20% of IBM's revenue. Let me spend a minute underscoring how we've been able to build cloud to a $15 billion business, and why enterprises are increasingly moving to the IBM cloud.
In the second quarter we added more leading companies to the IBM cloud. For example, Lloyds Bank has chosen the IBM cloud. Lloyds is one of the most advanced digital banks in the world and they expect to become even more agile by leveraging IBM's unique combination of private and public cloud capabilities. American Airlines is also using the IBM cloud as the foundation for this broadbased cloud transformation. Clients are choosing the IBM cloud for a number of reasons. First, our cloud is hybrid, built for the enterprise, that's public and private, and integrated with on-prime [ph] data and workloads. Second, they want to leverage our expertise in industry and their existing business processes and systems, and we know how to migrate them from one era to the next. Third, they trust IBM and the IBM cloud to protect and preserve not only their data but also their insights and AI training engines to ensure all of the value from their data accrues to them versus going to educative central knowledge graph.
And of course, we continue to add state-of-the-art tools and technologies to exploit enterprise data in the cloud; this includes Watson and blockchain. You see this last point cloud as companies deploy IBM blockchain and Watson solutions in the cloud. Recently, we announced an agreement with a consortium of seven of Europe's top banks to create a new blockchain service for trade finance for the small and medium business market. And in Australia, we're working with banks to launch new commercial property leasing services based on blockchain. And remember, we're already working with many others including DTCC, CLS and Northern Trust. Beyond financial services we're working with industry leaders like Walmart and Food Safety and Maersk in shipping. It's still early but we see a lot of opportunity leveraging block chain in the cloud and across multiple industries.
Similarly in the second quarter we saw Watson deployments continue to expand globally. The cognitive opportunity is a global one, it's not centered in New York or Boston or Silicon Valley; but you can't just look and listen in those places. In healthcare alone, you'd miss that this quarter the first healthcare provider in Latin America is deploying Watson for oncology, and Baheal Pharmaceutical Group is bringing Watson for genomics to clinicians across China. In fact, 80% of the hospitals who've adopted Watson for oncology are outside of the U.S., and that's just healthcare, we have Watson deployed with other leaders like Berdasco [ph], Honda and Vodafone as well. So across industries and around the world our clients realize that data, in fact their own data is the route of competitive advantage for all companies.
Remember, 80% of the worlds data is owned by enterprises, it's not searchable on the worldwide web, it's customer data, and patient data, clinical data, supply chain data, transaction data and companies want to unlock and exploit that data; and so that's why enterprises will move to cognitive on the cloud with someone they trust who has leading tools and industry expertise and a data model and business model consistent with their goals, that is the IBM cloud plus Watson.
I want to also remind you of the importance of the underlying technology stack. We've continued to reinvent the mainframe and our power platform to address the most contemporary enterprise workloads. Our new z14 mainframe is a great example. With a breakthrough in data encryption, IBM Z is capable of encrypting all data associated with any application, service or database all of the time and with no application change and no performance impact. Think about what that means for addressing global data breaches, the increase in government regulations and block chain opportunities. It's the biggest reinvention of our mainframe technology since the reinvention for Linux and open source software 15 years ago.
I'll touch on additional progress and examples of where we're winning in these areas and more details on our new mainframe capabilities as I go through the segment discussions. But first, I'll walk through our financial metrics.
Our revenue for the quarter was $19.3 billion, which is down 3% at constant currency. As expected, we had a larger currency headwind to revenue growth, it was about twice the impact of the first quarter. I mentioned earlier that we ramped on the acquisitions we completed in early 2016. We had two points of benefit in the first quarter from acquisitions and only about 40 basis points in the second. So excluding the acquisitive content, our year-to-year revenue performance was a modest improvement over last quarters rate. When you look at our revenue performance by geography, in the Americas, revenue in the U.S. was down while we had solid growth in Canada and Latin America. Our overall performance in Europe declined centered in Germany and the UK.
You will recall, last quarter I talked about the impact of the conclusion of services contracts in those countries which will continue through the year that will get some benefit from the new deals we signed in the second half. We had sequential improvement in Asia Pacific with growth in several markets including Japan which is our second largest country. I'll come back to the revenue trajectory later in the call.
When you look at our gross profit, our margin was down year-to-year but significantly better than the first quarter year-to-year performance. The year-to-year margin decline reflects both the mix and invests. From first to second quarter we got substantial leverage from our high value model. We added $1 billion gross profit from first to second with $1.1 billion of additional revenue, while last year we had similar gross profit improvement from first to second but we needed more revenue to do it. So that of course resulted in improved trajectory in the year-to-year margin dynamics; in fact, we had sequential improvement in the year-to-year gross margin performance in each of our five segments. We'll talk more about the drivers and trends in the segment discussions.
Our expense was down 6% versus last year with about half of that due to currency and the balance reflects an increased focus on driving efficiency in our spend base. As I said, we've been shifting and adding resources as we invest to build solutions and platforms. In fact, in the first half of this year we hired 20,000 people into the business; so our cost and expense profile reflects a balance between investing in key areas and driving efficiency across the spend base. Our operating pretax profit was nearly $3.1 billion which is up about a $1 billion from the first quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15% consistent with last quarter.
We also had discrete tax benefits in the second quarter of about $170 million or $0.18 of operating EPS. We generated $2.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter and net income margin of 14.5% which is up 50 basis points year-to-year. On the bottom line, our operating EPS was $2.97. We generated over $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter which is up year-to-year, and over the last twelve months our free cash flow is 94% of our GAAP net income.
So now turning to our segments, cognitive solutions had $4.6 billion of revenue, continued growth in annuity content led by SaaS and an improved margin profile. Our annuity content which represents 80% of cognitive was up 2% year-to-year driven by roughly 4.5% growth in solution software. We had strong SaaS performance with strong double-digit growth in signings and revenue again this quarter. Revenue was up nearly 30%. As our SaaS business grows, we continue to invest to build scale. The software transaction revenue was down double-digits due to declines in some of our license based offerings and as you know, this was a larger impact in the second quarter given the seasonality of our transactions. As we've said before, many of our license-based offerings are high value but in declining markets.
We also wrapped on most of our acquisitions and are focused on investing to combine organic and acquired content to build cloud-based cognitive offerings. Let me talk about the progress we're making in parts of the solution software portfolio.
In analytics, we saw good growth in Watson health and Watson financial services and in BI and data discovery lead by Cognos. We announced the partnership with Hortonworks to combine our data science experience in machine learning with Hortonworks data platform to allow developers to access data science and cognitive tools and create intelligent apps. We also had strong growth in our Watson platform which underpins our enterprise AI strategy as we build scale. Conversation API usage and the number of active users are up strong double-digits quarter-to-quarter as we helped clients embed cognitive into their workflows. For example, credit mutual is live with multiple used cases including virtual systems for insurance and savings.
These cognitive applications were rolled out to over 20,000 agents across France enhancing their quality of service for 12 million customers. In this quarter we added new partners like LivePerson which provides a conversational platform used for the customer care needs of over 18,000 businesses. Given the growing relevance of AI in digital channels, they announced a new offering called LiveEngage with Watson to transform the customer care space. LiveEngage can offer intelligent personalized digital support to each customer; this is an appealing market, the value Watson provides depends on the complexity of the conversation, so the number of API calls can vary but we have the potential to deliver value from every digital conversation. This will scale as more of today's 270 billion customer support phone call shift to digital interactions.
Within our vertical strategy, Watson Health had strong growth, particularly in the areas of state and local government agencies and oncology as we continue scaling. While market uncertainty persists, government agencies still face the realities of having to deliver services more efficiently; and our analytics and social program management offerings can help clients make better informed decisions to reduce healthcare costs and reduce outcomes. Both offerings drove strong growth this quarter; oncology is also scaling and is now in over 50 hospitals on five continents. Through the first half Watson has worked with nearly 40,000 patients and doctors and this will grow to approximately 100,000 by year end and many of these have life-threatening diseases such as cancer.
Watson for oncology alone has a potential to reach millions around the world based just on the hospital systems we've engaged to date. So we're just at the beginning of scaling, we continue to add new cancer types so our patient reach continues to grow. We're not just scaling our business into new areas but also improving deployment; for example, we implemented Watson for oncology at Baheal Pharmaceutical Group in less than a month. This quarter as I mentioned earlier, we expanded with Baheal into genomics. We also announced the new collaboration with Hackensack Meridian Health, a prominent U.S. provider to combine Watson for Oncology with their real world data to help oncologists improve cancer treatment and reduce costs.
For another industry example, Watson for Financial Services which includes the [indiscernible] acquisition, also contributed to growth this quarter. We launched industry expert trained AI risk and compliance solutions including anti-money laundering and know your customer. Beyond verticals, security, including security services which is reported in technology services and cloud platforms grew again this quarter. Offerings like QRadar and Resilient had strong growth as customers look to strengthen their ability to both the tax and respond to security threats. This quarter we announced the partnership with Cisco to address this growing threat of cyber crime. We will collaborate on threat intelligence research by sharing data, integrating our offerings and coordinating on major cyber security incidence.
Turning to profit, cognitive solutions gross margin is down year-to-year though improving sequentially driven by the continued investment into strategic areas including acquisitions and the mix towards SaaS. Cognitive pretax income is up year-to-year and this segment has very high PTI margins which expanded again this quarter, even with a high level of investment as we continue to embed cognitive into offerings, build and scale platforms and drive vertical solutions. In global business services, we grew signings for the second consecutive quarter and had modest improvement in the year-to-year revenue performance as compared to first.
As we've talked about, we've realigned our practice model to improve productivity and focus our strategy around three growth platforms. The first platform is where we help our clients build and execute digital strategies. Next is where we help our clients re-engineer their core processes. And the third platform is where we modernize our clients applications and move them to the cloud. This differentiated strategy is beginning to take hold as we accelerated our signings growth in GBS this quarter. Our cloud, mobile and analytics practices delivered strong revenue growth. Though consulting revenue was down 1%, our trajectory improved again this quarter with strong growth in our digital offerings. We continue to decline in traditional enterprise application work as we shift resources away from these areas to new areas such as SAP HANA, Workday and Salesforce.
We've talked about the path to improvement in GBS which starts with consistent signings growth which adds to the backlog and then ultimately revenue. Our consulting backlog this quarter was nearly flat year-to-year after several quarters of declines. We expect the consulting trajectory improvement to continue in the second half. Our mobile practice continues to expand with a portfolio of cognitive enabled enterprise iOS apps that can redesign our clients workflows. This quarter we announced new initiatives at several different clients including Lufthansa Group and Singapore Airlines. Application management was down 1%, that's been relatively stable over the past several quarters. Clients continue to look to us to manage the lifecycle of their critical applications. We help them move to new cloud architectures that improve the speed and agility of their operations by leveraging the value of their current systems and data.
Turning to profit; GBS gross profit margin was up over a point sequentially. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we added more gross profit dollars than we did a year ago, and we were able to do this on less incremental revenue. This was evidenced for the turnaround that we expect in GBS as we move forward. We continue to shift to higher value work while focusing on improving productivity. We yield at savings from workforce actions and continue to invest to remix our skills. While we're seeing pricing pressure in the areas that are not as differentiated, we continue to focus on capturing the value of our new offerings. We've streamlined our practice infrastructure and are driving efficiencies in our delivery model for new methods and project management approaches.
In summary, in GBS this quarter we continued many of the improving trends that started in the first quarter. As we've said before, the starts with consistent signings growth and we grew signings for the second consecutive quarter. We continue to shift to our high value strategic imperative and we're starting to see the benefits from a redesign practice model and refocused growth strategy. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities; put all this together, and we expect to see continued improvement in GBS in the second half.
In technology services and cloud platforms, we delivered a $8.4 billion of revenue. While revenue performance decelerated, our margin profile improved compared to last quarter and we signed a number of contracts that will contribute to improved performance in the second half. The deceleration was driven by infrastructure services as we ramped on some acquisitive content and shifted away from lower value work. While this shift impacted our revenue, it contributed to the improved gross margin trajectory. We also continue to be impacted by some large contracts that concluded, particularly in Europe, which we talked about last quarter.
Our business model and infrastructure services is one where we're constantly delivering productivity to our clients. Our clients trust us with their most critical IT operations as we continue to leave this space. The way that we expand our footprint is by helping clients move to cloud and drive new workloads by acquiring new scope and new clients. This quarter we were able to close some substantial new transactions including a six-year $700 million agreement with Bombardier; we'll move them to the IBM cloud and help integrate their operations globally. This will drive productivity, improve their agility and ultimately provide competitive advantage.
I mentioned Lloyds where we signed a 10-year cloud agreement valued at around $1.5 billion. We'll move the bank to the IBM cloud and migrate their application suites to this infrastructure. And earlier this quarter, we entered into a definitive agreement for the large Telco to acquire it's cloud and managed hosting business. This transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2017. We're working with them on a number of other strategic initiatives including networking and cloud services. These transactions will help improve our revenue trajectory in the second half. Technical support services revenue was down 1%, a point better than last quarter's rate.
We continue to grow in our multi-vendor support services where we provide wall-to-wall support for our clients IT operations. Integration software revenue was down 1% which is nearly two points better than the first quarters rate. Our annuity base remains stable with strong growth in SaaS across our offerings including webs for your application server and our hybrid transformation and connect the cloud offerings. Transactional revenue within integration software declined as more of this portfolio shifts to the IBM cloud which will benefit us overtime. Across the segment we delivered strong growth in cloud analytics, mobile and security. The service run rate for the segment increased to $5.8 billion.
Clients are moving to the IBM cloud because it's built for the enterprise and can optimize workloads across hybrid environments. The underline architecture protects our clients data and insights and is optimized for cognitive workloads to help our clients create new business models. The American Airlines example I referenced earlier is a great example where we're building on the partnership we signed last year. American Airlines announced this quarter they will move to the IBM cloud and use it as the foundation for their digital transformation. They will migrate critical applications including AA.com, their customer facing mobility app and their global network of kiosks.
Looking at profit, gross profit margin for the segment was down year-to-year but up a point sequentially. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we added about the same gross profit dollars we did a year ago on less than half of the incremental revenue, so you can see the leverage you can get in this business. We drove efficiencies and services delivery and yielded savings from workforce actions. We've been investing in our automation capabilities and launched the IBM services platform with Watson last week. This platform offers next-generation enterprise IT services using cognitive technology and will drive operational efficiencies and improve delivery performance for our clients.
We also continue to invest in our IBM cloud capabilities. We announced the opening of four new cloud centers in the U.S. extending our capacity with centers in key local markets across 19 different countries. This provides enterprises with the ability to run their data and applications locally and meet regulatory requirements. Clients can provision cloud infrastructure when in where they needed.
In summary, for technology services in cloud platforms, infrastructure services revenue decelerated given the ramp on some acquisitive content and the shift away from lower value work given some of the significant transactions we closed this quarter and strong demand for our cloud services, we expect our revenue trajectory to improve in the second half. We also expect the improved trends in profit to continue.
In systems this quarter we had a significant improvement in our year-to-year revenue trajectory and an improved margin profile quarter-to-quarter. This is the second quarter in a row with growth in storage. Our power declines moderated and our mainframe business is consistent with what you would expect at the end of the cycle. Mainframe and storage margins grew year-to-year and power margins improved sequentially. Our overall systems margin was down year-to-year reflecting mix largely due to product transitions.
In Z systems as I mentioned, our results are reflective of being in the tenth and final quarter of the z13 product cycle. Revenue declined year-to-year, gross margin expanded and we added four new clients this quarter for a total of 91 since the launch of z13. We continue to deliver innovation on the platform in support of our clients evolving workload needs. For example, a large bank in Europe selected Linux One as the strategic platform for their BPM deployments which will help the bank achieve significant savings over the next five years. Few large government clients expanded their mainframe capacity helping them drive down the operating cost for these agencies.
In the areas of new workloads, we had wins in both blockchain and instant payments. The blockchain wins were geographically disperse as we help our clients around the world tackle business challenges with the emerging blockchain technology. We closed three instant payment deals in Europe to help our banking clients comply with the EU payment modernization initiative.
I want to spend a minute on our new z14 mainframe that we announced yesterday. After three years of development and working with more than 150 clients, this is the world's most powerful transaction system capable of running more than 12 billion encrypted transactions per day and provides breakthrough pervasive encryption. This data encryption engine encrypts all data associated with any application, cloud service or database all of the time without the possibility of human intervention, and that's with no application change and no performance impact.
We took on this challenge to address both the global data breach epidemic and the need to operate within government regulations. In fact, of the 9 billion records breached in the past five years, only 4% were encrypted. Even with the rise of cloud data centers, little real progress have been made encrypting data at any scale because it's hard, expensive and it impacts performance, that is until now. Our new z14 system encrypts data 18 times faster than x86 platforms and the x86 platforms are 20 times more expensive. The reason why 92 of the worlds Top 100 banks rely on the mainframe is for it's high value, secure and scalable platform.
The reason they stay on it is because of it's appeal in new workloads and the advances we continue to make in the underlying technologies to address these. Like the new z14 with this unprecendented encryption capabilities, and we do this with increased performance at lower cost which is really valuable to our enterprise clients. So we can deliver all of this within an economic equation that works at the scale required by our clients. The power growth rate improved sequentially but was still down, the improvement reflects our transition to our growing Linux market while continuing to serve a high value but declining Unix market. Our Linux on power revenue grew and we gained share. We again had double-digit growth in Linux workloads. HANA on Power continues to play an important role in that success.
By contrast in Unix, the clients were driven by our low end and mid-range systems, high-end systems grew. Our power portfolio is focused on cognitive and cloud opportunities and we continue to expand capabilities and partnerships. During the second quarter we announced new integrated offerings with Hortonworks designed to help everyone from data scientists to business leaders better analyze and manage their data and accelerate decision-making. And we announced integrated offerings with new 10X [ph] to deliver hyper-converted solutions targeting critical workloads in large enterprises.
We also announced the new version of Power AI which paired with IBM Linux HPC servers reduces training of deep learning from weeks to hours. I'll remind you that will bring the next-generation Power 9 to market in the fourth quarter starting with two U.S. department of energy funded national labs. There are three labs of this type but no vendor can win more than two, so we won over-aloud [ph]. These will be the worlds most advanced data-centric supercomputing systems and we'll rollout Power 9 across the power portfolio throughout 2018.
Storage hardware was up again this quarter increasing 8% led by strong double-digit growth and our all-flash array offerings. Flash was the growth catalyst in our storage mid-range and high-end offerings. Storage hardware margins increased both, year-to-year and sequentially. So to summarize systems, our year-to-year revenue and gross margin trajectory improved with consecutive quarters of revenue growth in storage offset by the expected cycle driven declines in Z systems and Power. While we face some shifting market dynamics and product transitions, our portfolio remains optimized for cognitive and cloud, and we continue to expand our footprint and add new capabilities. Our recent z14 launch and the upcoming Power refresh beginning later in the year, will drive further improvements in second half performance.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, in the second quarter we generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations excluding our financing receivables. We invested about three quarters of $1 billion in capital expenditures focused in our Watson and cloud platform areas, as well as in support of our services and systems businesses. And so we generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow which is up almost $350 million year-to-year; this reflects continued strong collections performance for the second consecutive quarter. For the first half our free cash flow was $3.6 billion and over the last 12 months our cash realization rate is 94%, four points higher than last quarters trailing 12 months rate.
The first half free cash flow of $3.6 billion is down $900 million year-to-year. However, you will recall in the first half of last year we had a $1.2 billion Japan tax refund. As we look forward to the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to be roughly flat with last year with the first half year-to-year headwind switching to a tailwind in the second half from taxes and workforce rebalancing payments. And of course, this reflects the level of profit consistent with our full year view of earnings per share.
Looking at uses of cash in the half, our acquisition spend was relatively light after a significant number of acquisitions in 2015 and early 2016. We're focused on investing and integrating these acquisitions as we expand our solutions and cloud capabilities. In the last six months, we've returned $5.5 billion to shareholders, including $2.7 billion in dividends. In April, we again raised our dividend and with that we've more than doubled our dividends since 2010. In the first half we bought back over 60 million shares and we ended June with 932 million shares outstanding and $2.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended June with $12.3 billion in cash and $45.7 billion in total debt. Both of these are up from year-end, primarily driven by the timing of this years term debt issuances and maturities. $29 billion of our total debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 9:1 [ph] and the portfolio remains strong at 53% investment grade. We've got more in our financing business and our supplemental charts at the back of the presentation. Our balance sheet remains strong and with our newly reorganized financing entity, we're even better positioned to support our business over the long-term.
Let me start to wrap up by putting some additional perspective on our revenue trajectory, and we'll look at it by segment because our businesses are at different stages of transformation. In global business services, we've said for sometime that the progression is driven by improvement in signings leading to backlog and then ultimately revenue. I plant the flag to mark the beginning of an improvement and the revenue growth trajectory for GBS back in the fourth quarter of last year. And we've now had two consecutive quarters of signings growth, substantial improvements in the consulting backlog and a modest 20 basis point improvement in GBS revenue performance from first to second. This is what improving momentum in the services business looks like. So now with this momentum and a more focused set of offerings and improvements in execution, we've seen improved trajectory in GBS in the second half.
In global technology services with decelerating performance over the last two quarters, we're planning to flag now at the end of the second quarter. With the ramp in some of our new contracts, we do expect improved performance in the second half but we're not counting on a return to revenue growth this year, just an improved revenue trajectory. And at systems, storage had been declining but you will remember we plant the flag as we got all flash into the product line towards the end of last year and we've now had two consecutive quarters of revenue growth. Power, I'd similarly plant the flag back at the end of last year; and for systems Z mainframe, growth is tied more to the nine to ten quarter product cycle which will refresh later this quarter.
Finally, in cognitive solutions, we've now wrapped on our acquisitions. Our annuity content continues to grow, this was driven in large part by our SaaS offerings and as we've talked about in the past, they ramp and build scale over a longer timeframe. Put it all together and we expect improvement in the constant currency growth rate through the rest of the year.
Now when we look at gross margin, I mentioned three drivers of our year-to-year performance in the first half. We've seen some moderations in the headwinds from mix and investments already from first to second and I'd expect that to continue. We're always driving productivity in the business and much of that gets returned to our clients in the form of price, or it offset cyclical impacts or it goes to the bottom line. In the first half, the net of these factors was an impact to our margin but as we move to the second half with new product introduction and improved services dynamics, I'd expect this to be a benefit to our margin.
With that altogether, and just as we expect improvement in our revenue trajectory, we also expect an improved gross margin profile in the second half as compared to the first. So in total, those drivers of our first to second half performance improvements are consistent with what we talked about 90 days ago. We'll have a new IBM Z product out by the end of the quarter which will drive an improvement in gross profit from first to second half. Related to that, we'll also benefit from lower systems development spending.
The new services contracts and global technology services will start to contribute and with the cost savings we're driving, we'll have better performance in GTS. In global business services we expect the momentum to deliver a better second half. We've essentially wrapped on last year's larger acquisitions which are dilutive to profit and we're not at the stage where we can start to yield more benefits from operational synergies. Our ongoing operational tax rate assumption continues to be 15% plus or minus three points driven by our anticipated mix.
As always, this is without discrete items but the rate is dependant on the mix of business because just like every dollar of revenue doesn't result in the same amount of gross profit, every dollar of gross profit doesn't drive the same amount of after-tax profit. But at the bottom-line, we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017 and free cash flow that is consistent with last year.
And with that, we'll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So operator, lets please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty
Yes, thank you, good afternoon. I appreciate the second half versus first half color but if you can comment more specifically on the third quarter because of the mainframe launch; consensus is modeling both better revenue and better EPS growth sequentially than last year. Are you comfortable with those boggies? And maybe in regard of that just talk about how you think this mainframe cycle will compare to past cycles? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure Katy, thanks, and thanks for joining the call. I guess a couple of things, I'll start actually where you finished on mainframe because we have in the past said that the economics for the mainframe for us, what we're looking for is that the overall economic equation cycle-to-cycle kind of holds and we saw for the last four mainframes, including the one that we just finished and now we expect the overall economic equation to be fairly stable, that doesn't map to a calendar period of it because we announced them at different times but we would expect the overall economics of the mainframe to hold cycle-to-cycle the cycle amount to the fifth cycle, we could have gone back further but let's just say that mainframe is roughly consistent with the past.
In terms of third and fourth quarter, I guess there are couple of things. I think you're interested in revenue and we'll talk about EPS as well and then where does the mainframe fit. On the revenue side of that typically we see about -- for seasonal reasons, we see about $1 billion 2Q to 3Q reduction for seasonality. Now we're only going to have a month or less of the new mainframe, we're going to have a month of some of these new contracts, not the full quarter, those will come in the fourth and so that typical $1 billion impact will be helped a little bit, $200 million to $300 million by mainframe or the services contract but that's about it for the third and then obviously the rest will be in the fourth.
And then from an earnings perspective, given the power of the mainframe and the profit equation, how it helps mix plus our typical -- you know, typically we have a lot of our transaction business in the fourth. When you look at our EPS guidance, we're up a little bit for the year; we're up even less than the full year now through the first half. And then third quarter I wouldn't expect to drive much growth at all. I think most of the growth rate is going to be in the fourth, again, given the cycle dynamics and quite frankly, given the fact that the benefit really is only a month now and three months of the fourth. Thanks, Katy.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy. Can we take the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. Martin, your cognitive solutions, pretax margins were up nicely, both on a quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year basis despite some continued weakness on the transactional business. Can you address what the main drivers there were for cognitive margins and PTI specifically was at lower drag from M&A, better contribution from the SaaS assets and do you see that sustained continued sort of year-on-year improvement in the second half for cognitive PTI margins? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, thanks Wamsi. Well, you've kind of answered your question, so well done. No it is -- it really is a reflection of a few things. One is sequentially we've got a benefit from scale, now that's annual, that's year-to-year as well as sequential, but we're getting a benefit from scale as we build those service businesses. And then just like when we wrap on an acquisition and the revenue benefit, at the same time that allows us -- not allows us but what we start to do is we start to build the consolidation if you will and the efficiency in getting those acquisitions onto our own platform; so we get kind of local expense savings if you will from doing things once as opposed to a number of times around a unit. So better scale, ramping acquisitions, not only on the growth but then we get an opportunity to get a bit more productivity out of them. And yes, those -- I would expect that margins in cognitive solutions while on a year-to-year basis we still see -- because of mix we still see a year-to-year decline, sequentially we'll continue to improve on those things, the things I identified; the scale will last forever and then the wrap on the acquisitions will start to deteriorate in another three or four quarters.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Wamsi. Can we please take the next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steve Milunovich
Thank you. Martin you made a number of positive comments about the trajectory of services but the supplemental slides, the signings overall are down 14% year-over-year and the backlog is now down to 4% year-over-year. What's going on there and why do you think that's going to improve?
Martin Schroeter
Yes, couple of things Steve. First, let's pull signings, we'll talk about backlog because the impact of signings on backlog, as you know we've talked about it is different when it's a renewal versus when it's new business and siginings, they don't playout as we said in the past on a 90-day period, obviously the longer you get, the more it looks like your backlog but you got to get over a pretty long timeframe in order to have the signings translate directly into backlog. So in the first half of this year we had one of the biggest new contract signings we've had for any six month period as big as it was; last year it was bigger than the year before. So what happens in our backlog is those new contracts come on once we go through the transition period, as I mentioned earlier and that for us it will start to be September, once you get through that transition period, all of that translates to revenue rather quickly, that's different from a backlog or signing that goes into backlog as an extension of a contract that's ten years old and is about to expire because that is not going to drive any incremental growth.
So yes, on GTS the backlog is down, the new signings go in though at a rate that will drive revenue in the near-term and so the backlog being down is something we obviously have to work on a few years out because those contracts are going to come due and we have to get them renewed because it's not going to drive any growth but we need the backlog. And on GBS, we had second quarter in a row of good signings, performance, in fact an acceleration from the first and within their backlog now, as we noted in our prepared remarks, our consulting business now has gotten itself back to kind of a flat backlog which in the near-term that tends to yield pretty quickly as we deliver; so they were battling double-digit declines in backlog for a while, they worked their way out of that spiral; and so we'll see a near-term yield on the consulting side as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Steve. Operator, can we please take the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Ingin Wang with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Ingin Wang
Hi, thanks for the update. Just on the strategic comparative, it's up 7%; is high single digit a good proxy for organic growth and strategic comparative for the year because you hired the efficiency I think. Martin, [indiscernible] and the focus was due more towards maybe margin, then revenue acceleration within strategic comparatives?
Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Ingin. A couple of things I think worth noting. Yes, we certainly ramped on the acquisitions and so this is a pretty good proxy for the organic piece and it is mostly as a service, right, so it's not going to drive the same impact on our big base of business as it would if you ramped on an on-prime business because it didn't have the same impact to begin with. Now -- by the way we're not out of the acquisition business, right, we're still active acquirers, we just happen to ramp on and are getting our feet under us on everything we did in the past 18 months but we are still active acquirer. So that will drive some of the growth but when we think about strategic imperatives, going forward I would expect that we get a bit of an acceleration from the new mainframe, power will drive a bit and quite frankly, the services contracts, particularly the new ones that we signed and we talked about, they are cloud contracts, they are to help our clients build and run clouds and move them onto the cloud.
So just like we've encouraged everyone to look at the strategic imperatives on a trailing 12 month basis which they we're at 11% on a trailing 12 month basis; with the acceleration now through the back half of the year, when we get to the end of this year, I'd expect us to be still on that same trailing 12 months, so the whole calendar year I'd expect us to be in that 10% to 11% range on strategic imperatives as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Ingin. Can we go to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes, thank you. Martin, I was wondering if you could just quickly clarify, I think you said you didn't expect EPS growth in Q3. Consensus is looking for $0.09 year-over-year improvement in Q3; are you suggesting that's not something that's appropriate? And then more specifically, my question -- for strategic imperatives, it sounds like you feel organic growth is 7%, are you still confident overall growth will be 10% plus which is something you articulated at your investment day? And if you are, is the proper implication to think about three points of strategic imperative growth coming from acquisitions which is about $1 billion a year in acquisition revenue; is that sort of the framework by which we should think? And are you still confident in that double-digit sustained growth for strategic imperatives? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, thanks Toni. So first on the non-question clarifying piece; look, we've got a base $3 plus on a base, we're roughly flat, I think we're at a level now where it's just too fine a number in order to say am I talking about $0.09 on a three -- almost mid-three, anyway, it's a big base, $0.09, too fine for me. On strategic imperatives, again, you know, I do expect us to accelerate in the second half for the year for the reasons we've talked about, right; we get new mainframe, a lot of the new contracts are coming on. And then the other elements within this and you can actually see it in the segment charts, we've got good growth in technology services and cloud platforms on the strategic imperative base, that is organic. We have good growth in GBS, that is by large organic. We have slower growth in the cognitive solutions but that's a massive base.
And then obviously what -- where we'll accelerate the most in the second half is the systems business which was down dramatically in the quarter but again, we're at the part of the cycle here where we would expect it to be down, so we gave the segment view already when we changed the segment reporting, we gave the segment view so you could try to put together now where we see that shift of business coming from. And as we go into second half, I think the most profound shifts are going to be in the systems business, we'll see continued good growth in the technology services cloud platforms unit, we could see continued good growth in GBS.
And then cognitive; you know, we have made investments, we're getting growth out of that part of the business, it is as a service primarily and therefore it's impact on the overall is more muted but if we were to acquire something it would go -- it would likely go back in there. But again, it's more muted because it's via the service business.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Toni. Can we go to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open.
David Grossman
Thank you. And perhaps Martin you addressed some of this in the last question but I was hoping you could help us better understand the growth dynamics in the cognitive and GBS segments. It looks like the strategic imperatives are well over 50% of the revenue mix in both of those units but they both are experiencing revenue declines; so if I've got that math right, can you help us better understand that dynamic and what that implies for the overall mix as strategic imperatives increase the greater percent of IBM's overall revenue mix?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, David. So we'll do it kind of piece by piece and I'll give you two words trying to describe both of them. One is magnitude, and I'm going to put that against cognitive; we've got -- it's a big, big business and obviously the service that we're building, it has a smaller impact and so we see growth but it's going to take -- and we're getting growth and they as a service portfolio but it's going to take time to build that and part of that portfolio, TPS, our transaction processing business as we have on the slide is down four, so that's a very high value business but it's a big on-prem [ph] business that it's going to take a while to outbuild if you will from as a service perspective.
And then on GBS, the word I'd give you is the transition. So I described a bit on our consulting business where we got the backlog back and back to flat and the consulting business has accelerated, the signings in consulting are good, the things that the growth is quite strong, the things that we're engaging with our clients on digital offering, those are resonating. So the consulting business comes back pretty well than the application management business; it's a fairly stable business and yes, we're helping our clients move those into clouds, we're helping them contemporize if you will, the way those applications work but that's not a big growth engine, it really is kind of a very stable base.
And then in GPS, in our global processing systems business, that's not high content of strategic imperatives but it is important work for our client and it's quite valuable to us. So in GBS as we make this transition, you know, the overall will be lifted and as we said we planted the flag on revenue growth back in the fourth quarter, now we've seen a moderately improving trajectory now and we would expect -- as I said the prepared remarks that third and fourth would be better again in terms of trajectory and revenue.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Let's take the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Amit Daryanani
Perfect, thanks a lot, good afternoon guys. I guess just trying to understand the gross margin discussion Martin, I realize 180 basis points decline in June is much better than the 300 basis points decline you had in the March quarter; but at what point do you see gross margins from a year-over-year perspective starting to stabilize and does stability in gross margin have to come in-line with strategic revenues essentially decelerating a little bit?
Martin Schroeter
Well, we do see as we said in the prepared remarks that we do see continued improvement in the trajectory, right. So down three in the first, down 18 in the second and then second half, driven by both mix and driven by the work we have underway in delivering productivity across our services platform, the work we have in improving our GBS margins which is now starting to come -- to show up in the ledger. So we see both, a mix of kind of structural benefits from productivity, we see a mix of execution benefits from realizing if you will the higher value of the solutions we're selling and we see a mix from just the fact that we're in high value systems business which is going to mix more strongly. So yes, we do see continued gross margin improvement on a sequential basis and improvement on a year-to-year basis sequentially, and that would position us pretty well I think then for 2018 but we've got work to do here in the second half to put that on the table but we do see it in the third and the fourth.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Amit. Let's go to the next question please.
Operator
Our next question is from Brain White [ph] with [indiscernible]. You may ask your question.

Martin on the z14, it sounds like it will have an impact, a positive impact in the second half of the year; do you think it will have a more favorable impact in 2018? And if you could give us just some guide post around the attach rate of the z14 or any mainframe cycle to both sales and profits of IBM, obviously it's a small direct percent of IBM's total sales and profits but if you look at the overall portfolio and the software and services that it ranks through that would be great. Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
So first, I think what you started by saying was z14 not much impact in second half and I think what we're saying is that it's going to have quite an impact in the second half, right. It was announced yesterday, it will become publicly available in September and so we'll get a month in the quarter but we'll get three months of it in the fourth quarter. So just to make sure we're clear, we do see a pretty good impact here in the second half from Z. Now the timing that impact will be most profound in the systems space because the hardware is what obviously goes out first. We also provide as you know, we provide maintenance for that but the warranty period is on, so that's not going to be sold for until after the warranty period expires, that's in 12 months plus. There is a software that goes with it but that tends to be driven by usage, not by a placement of hardware and so that also isn't going to be in the second half. We financed these, right, that happens overtime and so we get that money back overtime.
So the -- and then we sell storage, there is a little bit of tailwind in the hardware side but again a lot of it is software defined storage, so the benefit in the second half is systems driven, the rest of the platform if you will, will continue to drive profit overtime and a lot of that will been dependant on the workloads that it can attract and the workload is running [ph] now and how people scale which we feel quite good about. You know, one of the things we haven't spend a lot of time on, on the mainframe because the interest has been around security, the interest has been around in-line machine learning but one of the elements of the new mainframe is new software model which will allow our clients to partition off parts of the mainframe and run new workloads and test new workloads in a much more economic way so they will attract new workloads onto the platform again.
So in overtime, again, we're not relying on the mainframe as a platform to be anymore valuable it has in the past but I'll tell you what this mainframe solves a lot of problems at clients who don't use it today, have; and it provides a lot of new on-ramps for other workloads.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Brian. Can we please take the next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask your question.
Jim Suva
Thanks very much, it's Jim Suva from Citi. Martin, you had mentioned [indiscernible] several times in different parts of the businesses which is greatly appreciated. The question I have for you is, is there any correlation to cash flow and cash flow generation regarding those black [ph]. Like for example, if signings result from positive services growth, is there any impact of future cash flow as they start [ph] and how should we think about the cash flow with your sign-post or flag-post comment? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Jim. I think I heard it but you are -- you must be on mobile, so it was little bit hard to hear it. But I think the question was is there a correlation between planting the flag on some of the revenue trajectories and cash flow. So broadly speaking, the answer is obviously yes but it's kind of at the margin if you will. So as we turn our GPS business and we start to bring on all these new clients that we have and put them on the IBM cloud, of course, we expand the capacity of the cloud but that's already in our plans, right. So at the relationship level, everything that has to do with driving revenue is going to have an impact with cash but the way we have planned and talked about our cash flow all year has been flat year-to-year, we've recognized already that we're driving capacity into the cloud that we have to build the capacity in the scale we need and so it doesn't have an impact into the way we've guided it but obviously there is a correlation between what kind of growth we get and the cash demands if you will of the business but not different from what we've talked about all year.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Jim. Let's take one more question please.
Operator
Our last question is from Meena [ph] with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, thanks. If you look historically at sort of the make up of the different quarters for the full, the last six years you generated roughly about 23.5% of your earnings for the full year in the third quarter. Is that based on your comments about the mainframe and the fourth quarter; is that still the right way to think about the third quarter and then you get the bulk of the benefit from the mainframe really driving the fourth quarter earnings profit?
Martin Schroeter
Well, again, I think we talked a bit about the EPS Q [ph] and we talked where I think we're going to land. But as we said for the third -- but as I said, in the fourth is where we see most of the growth begin because the mainframe in the fourth is where the bulk of it is going to sit. So you do the SKU math in terms of percentage in the third but yes, the answer is yes, we're going to see the bulk of the growth from the mainframe in the full quarter mainframe in the fourth, as well as the services signings that will have a full quarter impact. And then obviously as we go through time and we talked a bit about this on the prepared remarks and you've seen some of our announcements about for instance the cognitive delivery platform that we're building; those build as you go through time as well, and so all of that will have more of an impact in the fourth quarter.
So just to wrap up, again, quickly; we finished the first half kind of spot-on where we said we would, we've positioned ourselves now to have the second half, that we're confident we'll deliver. The path from here though as we said is pretty -- at a high level, it's an improved revenue trajectory, it's an improved GP margin trajectory, and it's an improved expense trajectory and we have now I think in the second quarter shown that the GP margin trajectory is there; we've obviously got the ability and we've showed good expense management and disciplined investments. And then on the revenue we've going to go through it piece by piece to talk about where we planted the flag and the most recent again, second quarter we'll plant the flag on GTS, so we'll drive an improved revenue trajectory.
So thank you for joining the call. We look forward to talking to you in 90 days.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. In the first quarter, we delivered over $18 billion of revenue, operating pretax income of $2.1 billion and operating earnings per share of $2.38, which is up year to year. This is in line with the view we provided back in January and keeps us on track to our full year expectations for earnings per share and free cash flow.
In the first quarter, we continued to deliver strong performance in our strategic imperative with revenue up 13% at constant currency. As is typical, I'll focus on constant currency growth rates throughout. Our Cloud offerings were up 35% this quarter; led by cloud as a service, which was up over 60%; Analytic, the largest of our strategic areas, was up 7%; Mobile was up over 20%; and Security up 10%. We also continued to deliver core capabilities to our clients running mission critical systems and processes. Many of these products provide the foundation of hybrid environments, enabling our clients to get more value from there on premise data and applications. Some of these key franchises are growing like WebSphere, while others are declining as they are in declining markets. But all are high value.
We’ve been very clear that to be successful with enterprise clients and to solve real problems, you need to bring together cognitive solutions on cloud platforms and create industry specific solutions. And so we’ve been focused on building a cognitive and cloud platform, and massing the best industry skills and capabilities, all while maintaining our focus on delivering higher value solutions.
As part of the transformation, we’ve made significant investments and shifted resources. This level of investment and a longer return profile of the cloud of the service businesses are reflected in our margins. Our foundation is now solidly in place. And while the investments will continue, our focus shifts to improving the returns on these investments by building scale and realizing operating efficiencies, keeping us on track to our full year objectives. And so our first quarter results once again reflect the success we’re having in our strategic imperatives. We grew 13% in the quarter, which was compared to our strongest growth quarter last year. Over the last 12 months, our strategic imperatives together generated nearly $34 billion in revenue and now represent 42% of our total revenue.
With over $14.5 billion in cloud revenue over the last 12 months, we’re the global leader in enterprise cloud. We play an important role in running the critical processes of the largest enterprises. And so it's not surprising that each of the 10 largest global banks, nine of the top 10 retailers and eight of the top 10 airlines, are now IBM cloud as-a-service customers.
At our investor briefing last month, we spent the day showing how we’ve transformed IBM into a cognitive solutions and cloud platform Company, and the importance and value of delivering industry specific solution. We talked about the differentiation of our cognitive and cloud platform through specific Watson technologies, through our data first approach and our enterprise strength cloud. We bring all of this together in one-architecture and we’re providing highly differentiated solutions by-industry and scaling these solutions. I am not going to recap all of that here, but what I want to focus on today is some of the progress we made specifically in the first quarter with our solutions, our clients and our partners.
In the quarter, we expanded the reach of Watson and the IBM Cloud through our partnership with Visa, where Watson IoT turns cars, appliances and other connected devices into potential points to sale. Through our alliance with Samsung, where the weather company will be the default weather app on new Samsung devices, powering the weather experience for tens of millions of devices by the end of the year. And through our engagement with H&R Block, where we're now embedded in 10,000 branches, enabling 9 million filers to benefit from the Watson enhanced expertise of H&R Block’s tax professionals.
In the first quarter, we announced a strategic partnership with Salesforce to deliver joint solutions, design to leverage artificial intelligence and enable companies to make smarter, faster decision across sales, service and marketing. We also partnered with Wanda, one of the largest commercial and enterprise groups in Asia to bring public cloud services to China. We're building emerging technologies on the IBM Cloud like Blockchain and Quantum.
In Blockchain, we had over 40 new engagements in the quarter and are working on over 400 more. And as we’ve discussed in the past, the opportunities spend multiple industries. This quarter, we announced we're working with Maerks to use Blockchain to transform the global shipping supply chain; partnered with Northern Trust to launch Blockchain for the private equity market; and are collaborating with the FDA to explore how a Blockchain can benefit public health.
In the first quarter, we also announced the first commercial Quantum system. IBM 2 systems are designed to tackle problems that are beyond the reach of today's computing system. These are just a few of the examples of the reach and scale we're building with cognitive and cloud, and I'll highlight a few more in the segment discussions. But first, I'll walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.
Our revenue for the quarter was $18.2 billion, which is down 2%. Currency was once again a headwind to growth, fairly consistent with the impact in the fourth quarter. At current spot rates that headwind will be more substantial over the next couple of quarters. On a geographic basis, last quarter I talked about the impact the macro and geo-political trends on some countries’ performance. In Europe, much of this continued into the first quarter with the clients in the UK and Germany, in particular, putting pressure on our growth.
Our gross margin performance continues to reflect investments across our business and the mix to as service businesses. I'll talk about additional drivers in the segment discussions. Looking at our expense, pre-tax profit tax rate and cash flow metrics, a year-to-year dynamics, reflect some unique items in last year's first quarter result. A year ago, we had charges that impacted our expense and pre-tax income by nearly $1.5 billion, including a work force rebalancing charge of $1 billion.
In the first quarter of this year, our work force rebalancing charge was about $170 million, so the year-to-year impact of a lower level of workforce rebalancing accounts for 11 point of the 20% reduction in total expense. Our expense also includes a higher level of IP income, reflecting the success we've had in rebuilding our intellectual property income base through IP partnerships. I'll come back to this a little later. And so our operating pre-tax profit of $2.1 billion was up over 50% this quarter.
Our tax rate for the quarter reflect an ongoing operating effective tax rate of just under 15%, in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year of 15% plus or minus 3 points. We also said, we've had a discreet tax benefit in the first quarter of $400 million to $500 million, and in the quarter, the net benefit was just under $500 million. This is far less than in discreet benefit we had last year of $1.2 billion associated with the Japan tax refund. And so tax was the substantial headwind to our net income and EPS growth in the quarter.
We generated $2.3 billion of operating net income in the quarter and net income margin of 12.4%, which is up 30 basis points. On the bottom line, our operating EPS was up 1% to $2.38. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is down year-to-year by the amount of last year's Japan tax refund. As you know, there is a lot of seasonality in the timing of our cash flows, much more so than in our net income. That’s why it makes sense to look at cash realization on a trailing 12-month basis. Over the last 12 month, our free cash flow was 90% of our GAAP net income.
Looking at our segments, Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 3% year-to-year and pre-tax income was up double digits. Our solution software revenue was up 5% while transaction processing software was down 1%. Within solution software, growth was again led by offerings in analytics, including our Watson related offerings and Security. We saw strong SaaS performance with strong double digit growth again this quarter.
I’ll share more on our progress starting with Analytics. We saw good growth in on premise data basis and data warehousing, which includes DB2, Informix and Netezza. Content and integration offerings were also up this quarter as data ingestion as an important initial step in a cognitive journey. As part of that journey, our Watson platform continues to gain momentum in the marketplace.
The Watson platform, built on the IBM Cloud, underpins our AI strategy and is a fast and easy way to embed cognitive into our clients’ work flows. Two great examples are Salesforce H&R Block. H&R Block went from an idea to fundamentally changing the client engagement experience with Watson, redesigning business processes and deploying a cognitive solution across 10,000 branches in just a matter of months.
Building on the platform, we’ve differentiated with industry expertise across verticals. In Watson Health, we had strong growth, particularly in oncology, government and life sciences, as we move to scaling Watson and healthcare. Out of the top 25 life sciences companies, nearly half are either using or implementing our cognitive offerings. In an environment of increased regulatory pressure, Cognitive helps to expedite the time to bring drugs to market and to monitor them, once in the market.
This quarter, we also introduced new cognitive offerings, such as Watson Imagining Clinical Review and infuse Cognitive into existing offering. For example, in Watson Care Manager, we’re bringing organic and acquired content together to build the cloud based offering that addresses integrated care; we’re then adding cognitive capabilities to extract trends and provide actionable insights. This is the kind of work we can do with our industry specific development skills.
We also had good growth in Watson IoT where we added over 50 new clients to our IoT platform again this quarter. And we’re incorporating new capabilities into the IoT platform, such as the visa payment services mentioned earlier. Clients are collocating for innovation at our Munich center, and the number of developers on our IoT platform had strong double digit growth.
Watson for Financial Services also contributed to growth this quarter. Here, we’re leveraging the skills we acquired through the acquisition of Promontory, the world’s leading regulatory compliance consulting firm, to develop cognitive offerings in areas like regulatory change management. It is a space ideally suited for cognitive because its expertise and domain driven; banks aren’t going to automate core regulatory processes with publicly available data alone. By combining industry experts with cognitive capabilities and levering industry specific client data, we’re building solutions that solve the problems in the industry. Remember, it matters who change your AI platform on what data and who owns the insights. By pulling all of this together, IBM will be well positioned as the leader in the reg tech marketplace.
Security also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven again by areas such as data security and security intelligence. We’ve had strong traction in Watson for Cyber Security since launching in February, and deployed it in over 50 customers globally. And we embedded Cognitive into another offering, MaaS360 Advisor, using machine learning to analyze and protect devices. We complement our software offerings with security services to offer the broadest portfolio in the industry. Together with our security services, we outpace the market.
Turning to transaction processing software, performance improved sequentially driven by Z Systems Middleware and Storage Middleware. While the overall business is declining, we have some areas that are growing, like software-defined-storage; other parts are high value and running mission critical workloads for our clients but the growth profile is stable-to-declining.
Turning to profit, Cognitive Solutions’ gross margin is down, driven by continued investment into strategic areas, including acquisitions and the mix toward SaaS. Roughly a quarter of the Cognitive Solutions business is now services and SaaS offerings, which currently have a different margin profile. Pre-tax income is up for the segment and improving year-to-year even when you adjust for the lower rebalancing charges. This segment has very high PTI margins, which expanded this quarter. So for the Cognitive Solutions segment, we grew revenue and profit in the quarter. We’re embedding Cognitive into more offerings, scaling platforms and building high value vertical solutions.
Global Business Services was down 2%, which is a two point improvement in the trajectory from last quarter. Strategic Imperatives grew double-digits, led by our cloud and mobile practices. Overall, we had modest growth in signings this quarter, driven by our digital offerings. However, the GBS backlog is still declining. As we talked about last quarter, we need the growth from our new offerings to drive consistent signings growth to improve the trajectory of the GBS backlog.
Consulting revenue was down 2%, improving nearly 3 points from last quarter performance. We have good growth in IBM iX, our digital design practice that helps our clients build new customer and employee engagement models around digital. We've built a robust network of 35 design studios around the world where clients co-create with GBS consultants in digital strategy, design and mobile experience.
We’re redesigning our clients’ work flows through integrated solutions and a robust set of enterprise grade mobility applications. This quarter, we announced agreements with BP Castrol, Bell Canada and Santander to name a few. In Consulting, we continue to shift resources to our Cognitive Services, Advanced Analytics and Digital Platform, and away from the more traditional areas, including consulting for on premise enterprise applications and some migration and process reengineering services. Our consulting revenue reflects this shift. Application management was flat year-to-year and has been relatively stable over the last year. We're innovating our clients’ platforms helping them migrate to new cloud architectures increasing their speed and agility, and ultimately, improving their competitiveness.
Turning to profit, we continue to invest in our strategic imperatives and build-out our practices around cognitive, cloud, mobile and digital design. Over the last year, we've added nearly 8,000 resources to these businesses. There also continue to be accounts where we are investing more to deliver on important client commitment. And in parallel, we're streamlining the practice infrastructure and driving efficiencies in our delivery model through new methods, solutions and project management approaches.
As we talked about at our investor briefing, GBS is aligned and focused its capabilities around three growth platforms. The first is digital strategy and iX, where we help clients to imagine what their businesses should look like in the digital world and then execute a roadmap to build and migrate their capabilities to get them there. The second is cognitive process transformation where we help clients adapt their core processes and integrate cognitive technology to gain insight, drive efficiencies and create new business model. The third is cloud application innovation where we modernize our systems by putting in place new cloud centric application architectures tailored to their business and their industry.
With deep industry capabilities we're executing a strategy that is client value led and powered by IBM assets and leading third party platforms. We're refocused our practice model to ensure we're building deep skills in the right areas and increasing our sales and delivery capacity. We're starting to see the benefit of this focus and are expecting improved performance over the course of the year.
Technology services and cloud platforms revenue was down 2%. We continue to have strong double digit growth in our strategic imperatives particularly in cloud which was up over 40% as we build out hybrid cloud environment for our client. As enterprises move to the cloud, they need help in managing the complexity of integrating multiple environments. We're able to move these enterprises to the cloud in a way that leverages their critical data and IT investment. Our cloud as a service revenue for the segment grew over 50% and our annual as-a-Service run rate was $5.7 billion.
Infrastructure services was down 2%, as you know this is a business model where we drive productivity for our clients. We orchestrate disparate systems and optimize IT operations. We help clients manage their hybrid cloud environment which can include multiple cloud platforms, on premise data centers and mobile environment.
When we deliver this productivity to our clients that's less revenue for us, but then we look to create new revenue streams by moving them to new areas, acquiring new scope and bringing on new clients. So our business model has always been to deliver productivity for our clients and then grow by expanding our scope of work and adding new clients to the platform.
While we had some substantial relationships lined up we did not get them closed by quarter end which impacted revenue in the period. The revenue trajectory also reflects that a couple of large clients brought their operations in house due to regulatory and other unique circumstances. These clients remain on IBM platforms and will continue to be a trusted partner.
Turning to technical support services revenue was down 2%. We continue to ship more to our multivendor support services which again grew this quarter. We provide end-to-end support both inside and outside the data center including for example IoT environment. Integration software was down 3%. We grew in our hybrid integration software that connects and integrates applications, data and processes across on premise and cloud environment.
In addition Webster application server grew for the third consecutive quarter, demonstrating the importance of middleware in public, private and hybrid environment. We declined in our on-prem dev ops tools and IP services management software. While some clients prefer to keep this work in house these kinds of workloads continue to shift to cloud, we're seeing this as Blumix, our cloud dev ops platform continues to expand.
Looking at profit, gross profit margin was down while PTI margin for the segment was up 5 points year-to-year. This quarter we had a lower level of work force rebalancing and we recognized savings from productivity actions including last year's transformation actions.
Much of this was reinvested in new and existing skills. We are investing as we move to a Watson based cognitive delivery model. Through this delivery model we're able to manage complex hybrid cloud environment and provide more insights into infrastructure that is always on, available everywhere and of course secure.
In infrastructure services we're constantly managing resources and investment across our portfolio and the combination of the winding down of some contracts, signings delays and some investment ahead of those signings impacted our profit in the quarter. Finally, in TSF, we're shifting more to multi-vendor services and in Integration Software we are mixing more to SaaS, which impacts margins in the near-term.
In summary, when you look at our performance in technology services and cloud platforms, our clients need help moving to the cloud and managing the complexity of their hybrid cloud environment and we continue to see strong growth in cloud and our as-a-Service revenue. Our middleware also continues to be important in this environment. Our business model is one were we're constantly delivering productivity for our clients, this is what make us the market leader. The profit cycle requires that we invest ahead to provide the scale and efficiency that our clients cannot achieved on their own. These dynamics impacted revenue and margin this quarter.
As we sign the contracts that didn’t close in March and yields of operational efficiencies we’re expecting better performance in this business in the second half. Our systems revenue reflects declines in z Systems and Power indicative of where we are in the product cycles, while storage grew after repositioning for flash across our portfolio. Systems gross margin was down year-to-year with declines across z Systems, Power and Storage as we address market shifts and product transition.
In z Systems, the mainframe continues to deliver a high value secure and scalable platform that is critical to our client's needs, addressing both existing and new workload. We added seven new clients in the quarter and 87 since the beginning of this cycle. We also had five major financial services sector win this quarter with existing clients, as well as several blockchain engagements. Our revenue and margin performance for the quarter reflects the fact we have nine quarters into the product cycle and we expect the new mainframe late in the year.
Power decline, which reflects our change over to a growing Linux market, while continuing to serve a high value, but decline in UNIX market. Linux workload again had double-digit growth, outpacing the market. We're the underdog here and we have a 3% share, so there is a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Our expanded Linux offerings, Power on Linux are going to pass the double revenue this year and HANA on Power continues to play an important role in that success, by contrast in UNIX, declines were driven by our midrange in low-end systems.
Power while critical for cloud and cognitive workloads continues to be impacted by shifting our platform from UNIX to Linux, both in revenue and margins. Storage hardware was up 7% this quarter, led by double-digit growth in our all-flash array offering. Flash contributed to our storage revenue growth in both midrange and high-end. In storage, we continue to see the shift in value towards software defined environment, where we continue to lead the market. We again had double-digit revenue growth and software defined storage, which is not reported in our system segment. Storage software now represents more than 40% of our total storage revenue. Storage gross margins are down as hardware continues to be impacted by pricing pressure.
To summarize Systems, our revenue and gross profit performance were driven by expected cycle declines in z Systems and Power mitigated by Storage revenue growth. We continue to expand our footprint and add new capabilities, which address changing workloads. What we’re facing some shifting market dynamics and ongoing product transitions, our portfolio remained uniquely optimized for cognitive and cloud computing.
New systems product introductions later in the year, will drive improved second half performance as compared to the first. I want to spend a minute on our IP income and put our recent performance into context. Our investment and research and development generates a significant amount of intellectual property and we have a number of different ways we monetize it. Keep in mind that the vast majority of our IP is monetized to revenue stream, with only a small portion through IP income.
15 years ago or so much of our IP was associated with our semi-conductor manufacturing and design business. At the time, in addition to licensing some of the IP, we used joint development agreements to deal with the economics of our manufacturing scale. These partners essentially helped that scale issue.
Since then our strategy has changed which resulted in a different mix of business. We continue to have joint development and technology licensing agreements though fewer. Now clients see the value in our IP, but it requires continues innovation to stay in high value spaces. And so more recently we are forming IP partnerships to enable ongoing innovation in our IP while allocating our development resources to where we see the best opportunities for us.
In these partnerships, we license, not sell, our source go to a technology or services partner who assumes the development mission and invests to innovate and build new functionality, enhancing the value of the asset, which reinforces and support to our revenue stream. We retain the ownership of the IP and the revenue streams and pay a royalty to the partner for the development mission. And as the partner sells to their clients they pay a royalty back to IBM from the revenue they receive. The benefits of these IP partnerships to us include the prioritization of our development resources, the continued innovation for our clients based on our high value assets and the creation of additional channels which can expand the clients base.
So to sum it up, our ability to monetize IP, is driven by the amount of IP that we create, which is substantial, not whether a transaction occurs in a particular period. Because our IP is high value and relevant to our clients it is attractive to a broad range of technology and services partners who can build solutions around the core assets. We had three new IP partnership agreements in the first quarter and now 19 over the last two years.
To put that in perspective we have licensed, on a non-exclusive basis about 1% of our software code base and these agreements to date and we are generating more IP every year than we are licensing, so we have a lot of opportunity in this area alone. But as I said earlier, why and how we chose to monetize our IP, for example, whether it to address scale issues or resource optimization, reflects our business strategy and so the opportunities and the model will evolve.
We are now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated $1.9 billion of cash from operations excluding our financing receivables and we invested over $800 million in capital expenditures particularly in our Watson and cloud platform areas as well as in support of our services and systems businesses and so our free cash flow was $1.1 billion.
Over the last year our cash utilization rate is 90%. Excluding the benefit of last year's tax refund free cash flow is flat year-to-year, and within that working capital contributed to our cash flow performance driven by strong cash collections. Our first quarter of free cash flow generation is in line with historical trends and we remain on track to deliver a level of free cash flow consistent with last year. Looking at uses of cash in the quarter we returned over $2.6 billion to our shareholders about half through dividends and half through share re-purchases. We bought back over 7 million shares and at the end of the first quarter we had 3.8 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
On the balance sheet we ended the quarter with $10.7 billion in cash and total debt of $42.8 billion. Two thirds of our debt was in support of our financing business which now includes the increase in leverage related to our client and commercial financing business IBM credit. The leverage in this business is now 9:2, which as I described in January translates to an increase of just over 600 million in global financing debt. 
The credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 52% investment grade, which is flat versus December and a point better than year ago. More information on our financing business is provided in the supplemental charts in the back up. Our non-financing debt was 14.3 billion with a debt to cap ratio of 48%, which is a point lower than December. Debt to cap is down 14 points year-to-year as you will recall that we frontend loaded our debt issuances this last year. Our balance sheet continues to have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long-term.
Let me wrap up by talking about how we see the balance of the year, starting with the progression on the first half and then drivers of our second half performance. As you know we typically see a profit improvement from first to second quarter. Last year the sequential improvement was significant because of the charges in the first quarter. Adjusting for these outside charges, we increased our operating pretax profit by an average of 800 million from first to second over the last couple of years. We see a similar level of sequential improvement this year, which means we would finish the first half at about 37% of our full year at least operating EPS expectation.
Now every year is different and we when you look at that 37% attainment compared to history, you will see it's a few points below the last few years. So I'll spend a minute on why this year the first to second half dynamics will be different, and why we remained comfortable with our full year expectation. To do that I'll give you a couple of examples of things that we know and things that we expect. We know that will have new system product later in the year and this will drive a significant improvement in gross profit from first half to second half. Related to that in the second half we'll have the investment ramp behind us, so we'll also benefit from lower systems development spending in the second half relative to the first. 
We also know that we'll wrap on last year's larger acquisitions, there will be less dilutive to profit in the second half as we continue to ramp revenue and realize some operational synergies. Then there are a couple of things that we expect, particularly in our services businesses. We expect that global technology services will sign a few of the larger contracts that didn’t close in the first quarter and that together with the cost savings and the yield on some of the investments we've been making will improve the first to second half profit dynamics. In global business services our trajectory is starting to improve and we expect this to continue throughout the year, we also expect currency to be a headwind and we put a view of that into the supplemental slides.
The translation of our pretax profit to net income will depend on the mix of business and the operational tax rate assumption continues to be 15% plus or minus 3 points. As always this is without discreet items. To put all that together, and we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.80 of operating earnings per share for 2017 and free cash flow net consistent with last year. 
And with that we'll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed with your question.
Wamsi Mohan
Martin, as we look at this quarter on a year-on-year basis we saw PTI dollar improvement of close to about $700 million, should we expect any more PTI improvement over the course of this year, given that the discrete tax benefit was 500 million, you can pretty much guess your guidance from those two elements, not sure if there is more discreet items yet to come, but conceptually is there are more PTI benefit yet to come or have you seen the PTI benefit already flow through? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, thanks Wamsi. The first thing I’ll say is I apologies for my voice, so if I sound kind of crocking -- I got a bit of a cold here. But hopefully you can understand. So with regard to what we see from here out, as you noted we got about 700 in our guidance on a full year basis, we did about 700 in the first, the thing I would add is that we don’t know what that mix is going to be, it's 15 plus or minus two points. So if you were to take that range, we either have another couple hundred to go if it comes in from a high tax area or we're already over solved by few hundred. So either way, you are in about that right range.
Now we have a lot of work underway to drive productivity in our services business, we talked a bit about that in the prepared remarks, we still expect to get the growth out of the acquisitions that we spend some money on. So there is a lot more obviously within the dynamics of our business from here to the end of the year. But if you just wanted to look at those two line items, then yes either we have a little bit left to go, if it comes in at a higher tax mix, so we've over solved already, but yes that’s the -- what the guidance implied.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty
At the Analyst Day, you talked about as you scale the cloud business, as you scale the cognitive initiative that we should start to expect margin stability and even inflection. You also talked -- essentially guided to GBS margin improvement for the full year. And when you step back and look at gross margins which is more of the clean read on your profitability not into the insight work pressure [ph] balancing and IP income, those declines accelerated this quarter in all of those businesses. So the question is, do you still expect that we can start to see stability and even inflection in any of those businesses this year or is that further out?
Martin Schroeter
So couple of things, when we look at -- we pretty much look at every year, one quarter is the low point in GP margin that always true. And then we build sequentially from there, I think what I would expect this year in that build sequentially, I do expect as we said in prepared remarks, I do expect the services units to start to drive sequential improvement in that business.
Now some have longer to go, more progress to make if you will, as we noted GBS with the declining revenue and the impact of margins, we also -- we believe that a business that can grow, pass the growth is what we described, which is consistent signings growth, we will get the backlog growth which will drive revenue growth. So all of that we still think we have ahead of us, we did get signing growth in the first quarter, it's 2%, but we got signing growth and so we will continue to build that business back.
And then in GBS specifically, the margins in the new strategic imperative work, the margins in the areas that that business is moving to remain better than the margins in the places they're coming from. So yes, we have to realize the productivity at the overall model level, but we are seeing margin opportunities in those new areas in GBS and we would expect to continue to make progress, but again in total the margin picture on a sequential basis as we always do will grow from first to second, third and fourth as well, and depending on the mix of business that growth that we typically see from first to fourth, could be three, four points higher and it's been as high as 10 points in some years. We'll be within that range some place by the time we get out of the fourth, but the first quarter is always the low point in the year.
Operator
Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steve Milunovich
Martin, you talked about the investments that the company has been making the last few years and previously suggested a little more flexibility this year, could you talk about in dollars, are the investments that you're making into the strategic imperatives flattening out? Should we look for less growth year-over-year in those investments, are they actually becoming flat and is there a point in the next couple of years where we could even see them decline year-over-year to help your margins?
Martin Schroeter
So, couple of things, one, when we said we would expect -- when the tip of the bow of the ship gets through the wave, that was a year-to-year statement, and so now with those acquisitions for instance in our run rate, the dollar level is at an elevated amount and so the year-on-year impact is diminished if you will. Now, all of those businesses need continued investment and for IBM, what it's always been about for us is shift as much as it is adding to that pie. So I think the adding to the pie now is behind us, if you will, and the shift will continue. So we'll continue to invest heavily in the strategic imperative, but it won't represent the same growth that what we've -- as what we've seen in the past now that they're in our model.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Toni Sacconaghi
I just wanted to confirm and clarify how you're getting to your full year '13 AB [ph] target. So for Q2, I think given that you expect 37% of EPS in the first half that would point to EPS of about $2.73, I think consensus is $3.17. So well below Street expectations. Which means that you have to be well above Street expectation for the second half. I'm wondering if you can also clarify what you're assuming on IP licensing for the year. It was up dramatically in the first quarter, I think you said it would be about flat year-over-year. So that implies the rest of the year IP licensing is going to be declining and therefore a year-over-year headwind, is that the right way we should think about it, and if you're IP licensing or your discrete tax benefits are significantly higher than you think today, will you be adjusting your guidance accordingly?
Martin Schroeter
So, a couple of things Toni, one we're not adjusting our guidance, we've reaffirmed that we see an at least $13.80 number for the year, and we also see free cash flow flat, roughly flat as we said. So same guidance as we talked about in January and quite frankly from my perspective the quarter played out you know pretty much as we expected, other than we thought we had a couple of more signings relationships in services that we could have gotten done, but by and large the quarter played out as we expected and we maintained our guidance.
In the prepared remarks Tony, we started to put together some of the things that we know and some of the things that we expect and I think that framework is kind of how I think about it. Now as you know we have a lot of scenarios around guidance and what might happen, but let's go through a couple of the things that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. First, you know the systems product announcements have kind of a double impact.
One you have to ramp investment ahead of the revenue in order to get that system ready. That's the period we're in now and we'll be in it through the first half. Once we get the systems announced and out the door then we start getting revenue and you get the double benefit you get GP dollars and you get lower spending in order to because you don't have to ramp any more. So that has a pretty profound impact on the first to second half.
We also talked about getting the acquisitions further embedded. Now we do a lot of acquisitions, there's obviously opportunities to drive investment in those but we also have a lot of opportunity to realize efficiencies in how we run. So we see an improvement from first to second half -- continued improvement first to second half as we ramp those new solutions around those acquisitions as well as get some synergies from the way we run the play.
In our services business as we mentioned we see an improvement as we go through the year, both in the revenue trajectory and in the margin profile quite frankly. We got a lot of work to drive productivity in our services business both in GTS and GBS and it sits kind of across that delivery platform we think there is a lot of opportunity to drive improvement as we get into the second half and then IP income, similar to how we described it in January, we said we have a bunch of scenarios around IP income, we see enough opportunity to be flat year-to-year, but our guidance didn't rely on it year to year.
So to your point, if we're flat versus excuse me -- here's where my voice starts to go Tony, I apologize. If we're flat relative to -- for the full year and we're up a bit in the first quarter, does that imply down? Yes that's kind of how we expected the year to play out. And in fact we said that, based on what you describe, it could be a bigger headwind the what you described, because not a lot of our scenarios have flat, some of them -- we had a -- like I said quite a good year in the second half -- quite a good second half of last year in IP income and so that could be down a bit, but again we've got a lot of scenario.
So the year comes together I think because we do have dramatically different profile in the second versus the first. We included the framing, if you will, of where we finish the first half because not every year plays out the same way and I think it’s important to understand the dynamics. But no change to our guidance and we still see the year playing out as we did in the first quarter.
Operator
Thank you, next question is from Ingin Wang with JPMorgan, your line is open.
Ingin Wang
Just one on the tech services side, it sounds like some delays in deals closing. Is that a macro-cyclical issue in terms of maybe a slow start to the year for some of your enterprise clients? What's the visibility into these deals closing in GPS and also the improvement in GBS that you just mentioned, is that also required improvement in macro environment, or is there something else that's driving that [Multiple Speakers]?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. So thanks, Ingin. These no macro, so I’ll talk about GBS specifically. And quite well, the nature of the work we do with our clients, we are running the hearts and lungs of our client's businesses. And so obviously, when you run hearts and lungs, you’re not running toward 90-day schedule. There is nobody by the way that’s in the room with you other than the client, nobody has the breadth of the capability that we have.
So our clients move at a pace that reflect the important of the work we do. And at the same time add into that the steps required for instance regulatory approval, we’ve got a lot of [technical difficulty] customers, there are a lot of customers in regulated industry. And so the signings delays were not at all macro driven, this is our -- these are deep, deep partnerships with our clients that require careful planning, careful execution and they’re not going to move on a 90-day cycle.
In GBS, again, I don’t think, we need an improved macro environment for GBS. In fact, one could argue that GBS will do better when clients are more focused on how to move to the future and more focused on or put under more pressure, if you will. The transformation that GBS is going through is driven by their ability to rescale in the new areas and we put -- we've poured a lot of people into GBS focused on these new practices that we have. The results that we see as the teams move into those new practices are very positive.
So no, this is not at all macro, on GBS it is again, because the relationships with these clients are so vital to how their organizations run and are never going to move on a 90-day calendar. And GBS I think is demonstrating now that as it moves into the future, it can do even better.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Jim Schneider
Just wanted to follow-up on the earlier services question and maybe ask about the commentary you made about couple of clients, order clients taking work in-house. Is that a commentary on the infrastructure and cloud piece of the business specifically, or is that a broader comment on the application services and like? And can we maybe just kind of talk about what you seeing terms of pricing pressure in the market, because you previously called that out several times, but didn’t this time? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, sure. So there is -- I wouldn’t say there is anything macro. In the two instances that we mentioned about people bringing -- companies bringing this in-house, very unique circumstances. And I think when I describe it, which I will, I think you will agree that they are sort of unique. So for instance, we have a client in Germany, it was renewed -- it was a five-year deal renewed for another five years and there is a rule, there is a law in Germany that this particular type of client cannot renew the same contract twice, just can't. And so they had to bring it back in-house due to regulatory reason.
We will still -- they took the people, by the way, they were all in structure that allowed them to take the people back. They still run their IBM mainframes. So we’re still partners with them on the infrastructure that they run. But that’s a highly unique, I am not making on macro statement. And in the other case, again highly unique to the client situation, they had a plan in their industry to split two businesses and so they were heading down the path of having two businesses with two infrastructures. We have them by the way, both of them and then the market if you will, they made a judgment based on the market that they were just going to take one of those businesses and sort of wind it down. So they just had no need, if you will, to have a big infrastructure around that particular business. So very unique, not at all what I would call a macro.
And then on pricing pressure, the nature of these relationships, again, as I mentioned earlier, these are substantial relationships that are running very core of what these companies need. And if I had to -- I guess these are complex, but if I had to simplify it, they're asking us to move them into -- in the future to move into cloud, to give them the agility and the security and the mobility that they see their competitors have. So there is -- there are not -- there is nobody in the room with us when we go in for those calls. And if they want to purse that path and as I think there is -- that suits their business model, then they're talking to us and we'll make those deals happen, but it's not a macro statement, its very much about our ability to deliver the future to them and whether or not that suits the way they're thinking their business at that particular time.
Operator
Thank you, next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC. You may ask your question. 
Amit Daryanani
I guess Martin, I just want to go back to the gross margin discussion and perhaps more at the corporate level, I realize that these margins will improve from Q1 to Q4. At what point I guess do you see gross margin starting to stabilize, the year-over-year declines start to abate for the company? And if you were to think about the cost saving benefits, what cost saving benefits that you have expected for 2017?
Martin Schroeter
Sure Amit, a couple of things. One, we are seeing the savings if you will of what we were able to start to transform last year and the actions we took. Now remember at the time we talked about Q1 '16. So a year ago we talked about how there was some -- some measure of that was to reduce capacity and a lot of that, by the way, that capacity reduction was to get our teams back together into collocated offices, where they could operate in more agile environment and it was to reduce the number of sites, if you will, which we had people and couldn’t collaborate properly.
So there were some measure with the reduced capacity, but the bulk of what we wanted to do is to revitalize skills, as we always do. We're always revitalizing our skills. So we see the benefit of that in the new skill mix that we have, we see the benefit of that for instance in GBS growing signings in the first quarter.
Now there is productivity that we see in the SG&A line, because while we are investing more for development our SG&A spending is down. And that was again not only the reduced capacity, but it's us being more efficient at how we operate. From a gross profit margin perspective, we are a high -- we have a high value model as you know. And so one of the things we are always looking at is, are the places we are going to still more valuable and higher margin than the places we are coming from and the strategic imperatives as we've talked about it in the past have a higher margin profile than the core if you will.
That shouldn’t surprise anyone, I think that’s why our investors expect us to invest into those new areas, as opposed to just going to chase some lower margin content. And we still see that now, it's been true since we have been talking about the strategic imperatives and it remains true that the margins in those areas continue to be higher. So I think that I still view the opportunity for us and gross margin is going to look -- gets better because again the places we're moving to is better than what we're coming from.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. You may ask your question. 
David Grossman 
Martin, if you look over the next 12 to 24 months I think the strategic imperative were in the low 40, the percentage of revenue. What are the main variables that dictate whether the imperative grow to over 50% of revenue and again to more than compensate for the decline in the legacy core.
Martin Schroeter
Sure David, so few things first and we talked about this a little bit in the prepared remarks and I think it's important, the legacy core is a business that we're confidently reinventing, it's not something that we are under investing, it's not something that we don’t like, we really like this business, it is very high value and some of that content sure fits in declining market. So it has declining opportunity, but that’s high value. And then, as we talked about in that prepared remarks, some of those businesses like Webster application server is growing, it's in a growing market and we grow.
So the core is -- and I know you didn’t say it this way, but the core is -- I just want to make sure everyone's clear, is made up of lot of different things. And included in that core, if you will, is -- we've got part of our power business, we got some of our mainframe business, we're just not in the time of the cycle for the core part -- for those parts of the core to grow. We will get to that part of the cycle when it grows. So then from the high-level math you did, we said that strategic imperatives would be 40%, we're obviously there, but 40 billion at least by 2018 and we're still on track to get there, in fact we're a little bit ahead of track.
Now when those two lines cross, I don’t know, I think that the investment community has been keen for us to stay on that solid double digit growth path and the strategic imperatives, there have been concerns every quarter about whether or not we're flowing down, but we just grew 13% on our toughest compare of the year last year because we did '17 in the first. So I think that the cross over point, I think is a mathematical exercise, what I'm looking that is, are the strategic imperatives and the growth we're getting out of those continuing to put us and keep us on the track to that 40 billion.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO. Your line is open.
Keith Bachman
I wanted to ask you, is pruning still on the table? What I mean by that is, if I think about the revenue growth the core actually decelerated this core compared to say the last three quarters. And if I look at some of the areas like GBS you have application maintenance that’s combined with BPO that’s over a 50% of the business and well under company profit levels. And I'm just trying to understand specifically focused on GBS, is how you improve revenue growth, but should you improve revenue growth or is there more pruning that you can do as it relates to the total IBM portfolio, but particularly within GBS.
Martin Schroeter
Sure Keith, so I think, I look at our portfolio and as you know we talked about this and we have been pretty clear that, we look at our portfolio through the eyes of value. And I think the portfolio, not solely through the eyes of growth, value and -- no value or a limited value without growth is obvious that we wouldn’t -- we would have a -- we would be thinking about whether or not that fits. But the portfolio we have today, I view as high value.
The AMS business as you pointed out, it's a high value business. Now the revenue is pretty stable, but it serves a really important need with our client base, it allows us based on how we do it with our industry focus, it allows us to drive value for our client. So I think of pruning is something you do when you don’t see an opportunity for differentiation, when you don’t see a longer term opportunity for value, and I look at the portfolio now and I think there is -- I think we have a very high value portfolio and I think that GBS, large GBS, all of it plays a critical rolled in that, I don’t see a pruning opportunity here.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.
Jim Suva
I think there is no question about the success in the strategic imperatives, how you are ramping those. The biggest question on many of the follow up calls, well maybe I'll give it one more shot, [indiscernible], the investment you are putting forth in the degradation to gross margins, when are we going to see them stabilized or do you have line of sight to that? It just seems like when you give up an invest, at some point, you want to progress the fruits of those efforts and it went out time and time again, so I’ll ask kind of one more time, do you see stabilization, and if so, when?
Martin Schroeter
Yes, sure Jim. So again -- and you know this is actually, it's an interesting question because -- it's an interesting timing of this question because I want to make sure that everybody understands that as we head now into the rest of this year and one of our focus item as it's always has been, but now the timing is right, is to get the returns for our investments. It's something if you were to pull 100 IBM executives, it's something that they would all say is, now it's time to get the returns.
So we have driven very heavy investments that has impacted our margins. But the investment is not the only opportunity, only lever we have to improve margins, we have a lot of opportunity in our services business and in our delivery model and how we drive margin. So yes it is time for us to get the returns we have invested quite heavily. The strategy is right, we hear it from our clients every day, the places that we are moving them to and the work we do in the core is highly, highly valuable to them. So I think now, the short hand in that is yes, now it's time.
And with that I’ll wrap up the call by saying, we have been making significant investments and now we've added, by the way, a ton of capabilities to the IBM company. We started new businesses, we made new markets, we've changed, as we always do, industries and professions and we'll continue to do that. But now it's with the business positioned very well for the long term, in terms of capabilities. Always opportunity to add a little bit here or there, but with the business positioned well for the long term, now it is time to focus on improving the returns on those investments. So thank you very much for joining the call today.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks Patricia. As is typical in January, I’ll start out with some top-level comments on the quarter and the year, discuss the details of the quarter, and then conclude with our view of 2017.
In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $21.8 billion, operating net income of $4.8 billion, and operating earnings per share of $5.01, which is up 3.5%. There are significant opportunities and shifts in our industry, and we believe that to be successful with enterprise clients, you need to bring together cognitive technologies on cloud platforms, that create industry-based solutions to solve real-world problems.
So with that very brief context around our point of view, let me comment on what we achieved in the full-year of 2016. We made progress in building new businesses and creating new markets and continued to deliver strong results in our strategic imperatives. We invested at a high-level, and remixed our skills to address these new opportunity areas. We also continued to innovate in the businesses that we have traditionally provided to our clients.
We returned capital to our shareholders and we achieved the earnings and free cash flow expectations we set last January, with $13.59 of operating earnings per share, and free cash flow of $11.6 billion, which is 97% of GAAP net income. So we did what we said we’d do, in a year not only with a lot of change in the industry, but also a year with a number of macro conditions and events, particularly in countries that are meaningful to our results. I’ll cover our expectations shortly, but right up front I’ll say that we are exiting 2016 in a stronger position than we entered it and that is reflected in our 2017 guidance.
Looking at some of the highlights of the fourth quarter, we had terrific growth in cloud, with revenue up 33%. We also had good growth in our analytics, security, and mobile solutions. We’re continuing to grow our substantial technology services business, reflecting the work our clients are demanding to help modernize and transform their infrastructures. And we had really good performance in our z Systems business, reflecting the value of differentiated, high-value solutions running important parts of our client’s infrastructure.
There were some macro challenges in the quarter in certain countries like Brazil, the UK and Germany, as well as the impact of a stronger dollar. As always my comments throughout will be based on constant currency. Our results for the quarter and the year reflect the success we’re having in our strategic areas, and the investments we’ve been making to drive that shift.
We delivered 14% revenue growth in our strategic imperatives for the year, led by cloud. We finished the year with $13.7 billion of cloud revenue, which was 17% of IBM’s revenues. Our strategic imperatives, together generated $33 billion of revenue in 2016, and now represent 41% of our revenue. To put this in perspective, when we first established the strategic imperatives, we said they’d grow to $40 billion, and represent over 40% of our revenue by 2018. The growth we achieved in 2016 keeps us ahead of track to the $40 billion. In fact, a growth rate of 10% to 11% from here gets us to the $40 billion in 2018.
We’re moving into a new phase. The debate about whether artificial intelligence is real is over, and we’re getting to work to solve real business problems. As we move into this new era, it’s important to understand what enterprise clients are looking for. They need a cognitive platform that turns vast amounts of data into insights, and allows them to use it for competitive advantage. They need access to a cloud platform not only for the capability, but for speed and agility. And they need a partner they trust, and who understands their industry work and process flows.
This is where we’re clear and confident about our point of view. Yes, we have world-class cognitive technology, but that’s table stakes. We are building datasets by industry that we either own, or we partner for. Importantly, we’ve designed Watson on the IBM Cloud to allow our clients to retain control of their data and their insights, rather than using client data to educate a central knowledge graph. And we’re using our tremendous industry expertise to build vertical solutions and train Watson on specific industry domains.
We are amassing these capabilities, because you need more than public data and automation algorithms to solve real problems like improving healthcare outcomes or navigating the banking regulatory environment. So in this new phase, data and the business model around data matters, industry matters and time matters and that’s why Watson is the AI platform for business.
Let me give you a couple of examples of the progress we made in 2016, bringing together cognitive, the IBM Cloud and our industry expertise. Watson Health provides cognitive insights on our enterprise-grade Watson Health Cloud, and leverages broad datasets that we own, including 100 million electronic health records, 200 million claims records, and 30 billion images. We now have 7,000 Watson Health employees, including doctors, nurses, health policy experts and 1,000 data scientists. We brought this together because you can’t change the way healthcare works, or work on curing cancer with public data alone. You need clinical data, payer data, images, all of which is private. You need the expertise of the leading oncologists and geneticists. And you need to do this work within a quality management system that is HIPAA-compliant.
So Watson Health was our first vertical. Late in the year, we launched Watson Financial Services, to provide targeted solutions, bringing together cloud, cognitive, industry and ecosystem capabilities. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Promontory, a leader in regulatory compliance and risk management consulting. We acquired Promontory because you can’t help banks navigate regulatory environments by scraping the web or automating keystrokes. You need top industry specialists that understand the complexity and can train Watson to deal with risk management requirements that are specific to financial services, because who trains your AI platform matters.
So bringing together cognitive technology, private data, a cloud platform and industry expertise is what you need to do real work in the enterprise. What is also becoming very clear is that as IT moves to the cloud and as business processes are delivered as digital services, it is essential they are enterprise-strength and that the transactions are trusted by all parties involved. That’s where the blockchain comes in. It’s a technology that brings together shared ledgers with smart contracts, to allow the transfer of any asset, whether a physical asset like a shipping container, a financial asset like a bond, or a digital asset like music, across any business network.
Blockchain increases transparency, auditability and trust. It reduces risk, and it can drive tremendous efficiencies. Bottom line, blockchain will help to fundamentally reengineer business processes and improve outcomes. We’re building a complete blockchain platform and we have already worked with over 300 clients to pioneer blockchain for business. Many are in financial services, to handle foreign exchange settlement, smart contracts, identity management and trade finance. Just last week, we announced securities clearing and settlement with DTCC.
But the application for blockchain is well beyond financial services. For example, we’re collaborating with Walmart to improve the way food is tracked, transported and sold to consumers across China, and with Everledger, who is using a cloud-based blockchain to track the provenance of diamonds and other high value goods as they move through the supply chain. Here too, the data needed to improve food safety or track diamonds isn’t on the web. It’s private data, owned by enterprises, who want to work with a partner they trust.
So in 2016 we built blockchain platforms and services, and in 2017 we expect to start scaling blockchain networks. I’ll touch on a few more examples in the segment discussions, but first I’ll walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.
Our revenue for the quarter was $21.8 billion, which is down 70 basis points. Over the course of the year, we’ve had growth in our annuity businesses, and some growth pressure in the transactional content. In the fourth quarter, even with a seasonally higher transactional content and a little less contribution from acquisitions, our constant currency revenue performance was similar to third quarter. With the strengthening of the dollar, currency returned to a headwind. In fact, with the change in rates since mid-October and the seasonal skew of our business toward the back end of the quarter, revenue was impacted by nearly $300 million.
On a geographic basis, we had sequential improvements in both the Americas and Asia Pacific, while EMEA decelerated. Performance by country would generally be what you’d expect, based on macro and geo-political trends. We’ve all read about various issues in countries such as the UK, Germany, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, and so our performance in these countries reflects that reality. Some of these countries, UK, Germany, and Brazil for instance, have a meaningful impact to our results. Collectively, these 3 countries had over a one point impact on our revenue performance in the quarter. Others, like Russia, Turkey and Egypt were also a drag on our growth, though less of an impact given their size.
We had really good results in China. In fact, China grew strong double-digits in the fourth, which resulted in revenue growth for the full year. This strength was in the banking sector, where our largest clients are upgrading to our latest technology to continue to run their infrastructure. I should mention that we also had good revenue performance in the U.S., where we returned to growth.
Our gross margin reflects the impact of our investments, including the acquisitions we’ve made, and the mix to as-a-Service businesses that aren’t yet at scale. Our expense overall is down 7% versus last year, and our expense-to-revenue ratio was down about a point and a half. This includes a 5 point year-to-year impact from the acquisitions we’ve closed over the last year, and a modest impact from currency.
Since early 2015, we’ve been talking about ramping the level of investment in the business in areas like cognitive and cloud. Our year-to-year expense dynamics reflect the fact that we’ve wrapped on that higher level of investment. We’re also seeing the yield from some of the workforce rebalancing actions earlier in the year. As we’ve discussed in the past, some of this is being reinvested in other areas, including cost.
Our expense dynamics also reflect the success we’ve had in rebuilding our intellectual property income base through IP partnerships. This is a model we’ve developed for some of our high value technologies that are more mature, but not necessarily in a priority investment area for us. So it made sense to work with partners who will invest and build businesses around some of these software assets. It’s good for them and it’s good for IBM.
We license the intellectual property to these partners, resulting in IP income for us. They take on the development mission, drive future innovation, and ultimately expand the client base as they take the product to market. As we generate revenue from our own sales, we pay our partner a royalty for the development mission they’ve assumed. As the partner expands their client base, they pay us a royalty because we retain ownership of the IP.
So with this model, we continue to own the product and our revenue stream, but shift our spending profile to a more variable cost structure, while extending the life of these assets. This is another way of monetizing our research and innovation, while allocating our resources to where we see our best opportunities. This quarter, our IP income reflects licenses for several software products and we have a pipeline that will continue into 2017.
Our pre-tax margin in the quarter was down 20 basis points. Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing effective tax rate just under 16% for the year. This is in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year, of 18%, plus or minus a couple of points.
We generated $4.8 billion of operating net income in the quarter, which is up 1.5% and net income margin expanded by 60 basis points. With a share reduction of 2%, our EPS of $5.01 was better by 3.5%. We generated $4.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $11.6 billion for the year, which is 97% of our GAAP net income. We returned three-quarters of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
So summing up the metrics for the quarter, we had strength in our strategic areas with a growing annuity base, an improving expense trajectory, PTI margin that was essentially flat, and net margin that was up, modest growth in operating earnings per share, and free cash flow realization and shareholder return for the year that was in line with our longer-term model.
Moving to our segments, Cognitive Solutions revenue was up 2%, and pre-tax income was up 1%. Our Solutions Software revenue was up, while Transaction Processing Software declined. Within Solutions Software, growth was again led by Analytics, including our Watson offerings such as Health, and Security. We continue to innovate the Watson Platform and extend cognitive across our solution offerings. We saw strong SaaS performance, with double-digit growth again this quarter. Our Cognitive Solutions margin profile reflects our continued investment into strategic areas, including acquisition content, and the ramp in our SaaS business.
Let me talk about the progress we’re making in parts of the portfolio. In Analytics, we are helping clients move data to the cloud and deliver actionable insights from the data with our cognitive capabilities. This quarter we introduced new offerings, like the Watson Data Platform, Watson Discovery Service and trade surveillance for Financial Services, spanning our core analytics platform, Watson platform, and industry platforms.
Our Watson platform, which underpins our cognitive strategy, continues to gain momentum in the marketplace. Natural language processing has long been at the core of Watson. Last quarter, we added new cognitive capabilities for conversation and the demand has been strong. We’ve seen significant growth in our API calls this year, especially around conversational services, where API calls increased 50 fold year to year.
Let me give you an example. In Latin America, Bradesco deployed a Portuguese solution based on Watson across more than 5,500 branches to assist employees in answering customers’ questions. Watson had already learned over 300,000 words in the Portuguese language, more than twice the number linguists say is necessary to be fluent. But this isn’t just about language translation – this is about understanding business. 
Watson was trained to answer questions on over 50 of Bradesco’s retail products. And since going live in October, Watson is now helping to answer nearly 9 out of every 10 questions every day. 
As I mentioned, we’re combining cloud and cognitive with industry expertise. In Watson Health, we are building scale and bringing real-world benefits to researchers and clinicians. With our offerings across five areas, including oncology and genomics, government, life sciences, value based care and imaging, Watson is helping over 45 million people globally.
Our oncology clients alone span more than 35 hospital systems. And with our acquisitions of Explorys, Phytel, Truven, and Merge, we have over 10,000 clients and partners. 
Genomics is another area where we’re building scale. We announced partnerships with both Quest Diagnostics and Illumina, where both companies will leverage IBM Watson for Genomics, a new service that integrates Watson’s cognitive services into genomic sequencing applications. Through partners, we will make Watson’s genomic analysis available to oncologists who treat 70% of cancer patients in the United States.
In the area of Life Sciences, Barrow Neurological Institute is an example of where we’re seeing real-world benefits today. Barrow reported using Watson for Drug Discovery to help identify five never-before linked genes associated with ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease. This work gives researchers new insights that will pave the way for the development of new drug targets and therapies to combat ALS. 
Without Watson, researchers predicted the discovery would have taken years, rather than only a few months. We had growth in our Watson IoT this quarter where our clients are putting the power of Watson to work across the immense data pool created by the Internet of Things. We launched new industry solutions targeting manufacturing and insurance and new collaborations with clients, like BMW. We more than doubled both the number of new clients and the number of developers on our IoT platform.
We also had good results from our Weather platform. Here too, we’ve demonstrated our tremendous scale this quarter. During Hurricane Matthew, our platform served as a critical resource for over 100 million people. Our platform delivered 350 million video streams over that week. Roughly 1.6 petabytes of data were delivered through a total of 141 billion API calls. With weather information, you have to be able to deliver that kind of scale, particularly when recognized as the most accurate forecaster.
Security also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven by areas such as data security and security intelligence. We announced a major expansion of our incident response capabilities, including the industry’s first Cyber Range for the commercial sector, at our new Security headquarters in Boston. Cyber Range uses live malware, ransomware and other real-world hacker tools culled from the dark web to deliver realistic cyber attack experiences. Clients learn how to prepare for and handle cyber attacks.
And Watson for Cyber Security is providing insights on live cyber attacks to 40 clients, including as you would expect several large financial institutions and universities, who are participating in our beta program. So for the Cognitive Solutions segment, we grew revenue and profit in the quarter, while we continued to embed cognitive into our offerings, scale our platforms, and build industry verticals.
Turning to Global Business Services, our performance reflects continued declines in the businesses we are shifting away from, such as large ERP engagements. From a line of business perspective, our consulting results were fairly consistent with our performance throughout the year, while application management decelerated.
We continue to aggressively shift our investments and resources to our digital practices, and growth in our strategic imperatives accelerated to 19% this quarter. Our cloud practice was up over 70%, mobile nearly 30%, and analytics was up 10%.
On a global basis, we continue to build out our digital design agency, the IBM Interactive Experience, which now has more than 30 global studios. In the fourth quarter, we announced a partnership with General Motors to bring the power of Onstar and Watson together to create the auto industry’s first cognitive mobility platform. 
Watson will learn the driver’s preferences, apply machine learning and sift through data to recognize patterns in their decisions and habits. This information will allow brand and marketing professionals working with Onstar to deliver personalized interactions that directly impact their target audiences. This solution brings together our cognitive technology with IBM differentiated data such as the rich weather data and IBM iX’s industry expertise in experience and mobile design.
As clients are looking to create new business models with our cognitive technologies, our industry experts in GBS are helping them scale. This quarter we announced a new global Watson IoT consulting practice to help clients introduce IoT innovation into their businesses. This will include 1,500 consultants, data scientists, and security experts with deep domain and industry expertise. We also announced that IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps can now be integrated with a broad set of Watson capabilities to increase the productivity and improve decision making for enterprise employees.
Turning to profit, GBS profit and margin were down. In the more traditional engagements, we continue to have some price and profit pressure. We continue to shift away from these areas to our digital businesses, adding nearly 8,000 resources to these practices in 2016. This impacts productivity in the near term. 
We’re investing in enablement, hiring top talent, and bringing in new skills through acquisitions. Profit this quarter also continues to reflect additional spending in some accounts to deliver on our client commitments. So for Global Business Services, we accelerated the growth in our digital practices, while managing a shift from the more traditional businesses, and we’re continuing to invest to build out capabilities and deliver on client commitments.
Technology Services and Cloud Platforms revenue was up 2% year-to-year, and pre-tax income was up 4%. Within this segment, our GTS revenue and backlog continues to grow. And this quarter we signed 16 deals greater than $100 million.
We are modernizing our offerings and helping our clients move to the cloud. Our strategic imperatives for this segment were up over 35%, with cloud up 50%. We continue to invest to build out our cloud infrastructure and we now have more than 50 cloud centers globally. 
In the fourth quarter, we acquired Sanovi Technologies, a cloud-native company that will enable us to deliver disaster recovery as a Service to clients undergoing digital and hybrid cloud transformation. This adds to our leading resiliency capabilities.
Looking at the lines of business, Infrastructure Services grew 3%. We built the IBM Cloud for the enterprise. Clients can mix bare metal servers, virtual servers, storage and networking to find the right balance for their workloads. Our enterprise workloads on our public cloud continue to scale, contributing to growth in our as-a-Service content. 
Clients continue to turn to us for enablement of their new digital businesses. These digital businesses require IT infrastructure that is always-on, available-everywhere, and of course secure. Clients often struggle with the complexity of sourcing and integrating IT services such as multiple cloud platforms, on premise data centers, and mobile environments. 
As a Services Integrator, we help clients navigate the complexity of their hybrid cloud environment and deliver the needed end-to-end infrastructure services solutions in an integrated and unified way.
For example, at a large Australian bank, we partnered with the client to build an IT architecture for the future. We are helping the bank design, build and manage a flexible hybrid cloud infrastructure. This solution automatically brokers, deploys, integrates and orchestrates across multiple environments and services. When the bank has a business need such as a new digital banking service, their IT is ready to support it immediately with a secure, integrated and optimized solution. 
We are the premier partner when it comes to hybrid cloud services integration. Our depth of capability and experience is unmatched in the industry. Technical Support Services was flat year-to-year and continues to generate substantial revenue and profit for our model. We are seeing growth in multi-vendor services, leveraging our global scale and deep technical skills.
We’ve expanded our multi-vendor services into industries like banking, retail and healthcare, and into technologies including ATMs, mobile, point of sale, and Internet of Things. Think of this as providing wall-to-wall support for our clients.
Integration Software grew again this quarter as we continue to see momentum in our hybrid cloud integration capabilities and WebSphere Application Server, which grew double digits. We continue to scale our Bluemix platform, which has grown rapidly to become one of the largest open public cloud deployments globally. 
Based on open standards, it features a robust set of high value services including our cognitive, weather and blockchain APIs. American Airlines named IBM as its cloud provider for greater enterprise flexibility and scale. As part of the partnership, they will move enterprise applications to the IBM Cloud, leveraging a wide range of application development capabilities through Bluemix.
At Majesco, the global provider of core insurance software and services, we announced a five year partnership where we’ll contribute cognitive APIs, that will allow insurance companies to better analyze, price, and understand business risk using new data sources such as the weather and social media. We’ll also add an engaging and personalized cognitive interface to their services.
And one of the largest banks in Thailand tapped Bluemix to build a new secure blockchain network to transform their credit approval process. 
Turning to profit, gross margin is down 1.4 points. Infrastructure Services margins were flat year to year, but Technical Support Services and Integration Software margins declined. In TSS we are shifting more of the business into multi-vendor services and in Integration Software we are shifting more capability to SaaS. This is impacting margins in the near term.
The IP partnerships are a headwind to gross profit margins in Integration Software, though a tailwind to pre-tax margin this quarter. Pre-tax profit for the segment is up, with margins expanding 40 basis points. We continue to focus on investing in our strategic areas, while innovating and driving productivity in our more traditional businesses.
So for Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, we grew backlog, revenue and profit in the quarter, with continued strength in our hybrid cloud capabilities across services and software. These results reflect our success in modernizing the services that we provide to our clients.
Our Systems revenue reflects growth in z Systems, offset by declines in Power and storage as we continue to address shifting markets. Systems gross margin was up year to year due to both improvement in z margins, and the relative strength in that higher margin business.
In z Systems, we delivered 4% revenue growth, double-digit growth in MIPs, and we expanded our margins. These results reflect our continued success in driving innovation in our core systems. The mainframe is optimized for mobile and security, and is constantly being redesigned to drive new workloads, including instant payments and the
emerging blockchain. 
Eight quarters into the cycle, we added 8 new clients in the quarter, 29 for the year and 80 since inception. New client adoption at this stage in our cycle further validates our clients’ perceived value and their ongoing commitment to the IBM platform. Clients are investing heavily to meet the demands for future growth. 
I mentioned earlier the strength we had in China. We closed significant z Systems deals in the quarter, including two large Chinese banks migrating their mainframe install base to our latest z13 technology. And in Europe we are helping our clients manage new requirements in the rapidly evolving area of financial services modernization. We had four wins in the quarter on instant payments. 
Given the critical nature of the European financial services backbone, TARGET2-Securities, or T2S, has been deployed on IBM z Systems to provide the necessary reliability, scalability and IT security. 
Overall, the mainframe continues to deliver a high value, secure and scalable platform that is critical in managing our clients’ complex environments. Our Power performance reflects our ongoing shift to a growing Linux market while continuing to serve a high value, but declining, UNIX market. Linux workloads continued double-digit growth, and faster than the market, while the traditional UNIX base declined. 
We have been shifting our platform to address Linux, and with fully expanded Linux offerings, our Power-on-Linux represents over 15% of our overall portfolio. Supporting this is our success in HANA on Power. The Power platform is critical to the workloads a cognitive world will demand. 
And in the fourth quarter we saw this in the U.S. Department of Energy’s deployment of hundreds of IBM’s OpenPOWER servers. When complete, these two supercomputers will be among the world’s largest scientific and AI computing systems.
Storage hardware was down 10% this quarter, which reflects the shift in value towards software-defined environments. Storage revenue declines were mainly driven by midrange and high-end disk. However, we are now benefitting from a full suite of all flash array offerings and this portfolio grew double digits in the fourth quarter. We also continued to see double-digit revenue growth in Software-Defined Storage, particularly in our Spectrum Suite and Cloud Object Storage offerings, which is not reported in our Systems segment. Storage gross margins are down, as hardware continues to be impacted by both volume and price pressure.
So for Systems, our revenue and gross profit performance were driven by growth in z Systems, offset by Power and Storage declines. These results reflect the reinvention of our core systems for work in a new era of computing. We have optimized our systems to drive new types of workloads like blockchain and instant payments. We’re expanding our footprint, building new capabilities, and solving new types of problems for our clients. And though we are facing some shifting market dynamics and product transitions in both Power and Storage, our portfolio overall remains optimized to address the demands of an era of cognitive and cloud computing.
So now let me touch on our software performance across our segments. Our total software revenue was over $7 billion, up 1%. Software was up 1% for the year as well.
From a business area perspective this quarter, we had growth in Cognitive Solutions and Integration Software, while Operating Systems continued to be a drag, in line with the longer-term secular trend. Software annuity revenue was up mid-single digits, led by our SaaS offerings. Our software transaction revenue declined mid-single digits, which is a significant improvement from the performance in the first half. Given the seasonality in our software business, transactional revenue has a bigger impact on our total software performance in the fourth quarter.
So moving on to cash flow, in the quarter, we generated $5.6 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. We invested $900 million in CapEx, and generated $4.7 billion of free cash flow.
For the full year, we generated $15.3 billion of cash from operations. We invested $3.7 billion in CapEx this year, with over a $1 billion in support of our cloud and Solutions businesses, as well as a significant portion going to support our services backlog and our upcoming hardware cycles. And so we generated free cash flow of $11.6 billion, and as I mentioned earlier, our cash realization remained strong at just over 97% of GAAP net income, consistent with our longer-term model of realization in the 90’s.
So, our cash performance is right in line with our profit levels as we talked about all year, and includes significant cash payments related to the workforce rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year, as well as lower cash taxes. We did see an uptick in our working capital as we closed the year, which we attribute to timing and mix of substantial transactions in December.
Looking at uses of cash, we continued to strengthen our portfolio by investing $5.7 billion in acquisitions. We’ve acquired 15 companies in 2016, including three in the fourth quarter. The acquisitions added to our capabilities in cognitive and analytics, cloud and security, and significant transactions included The Weather Company, Truven Health, Promontory, and three digital marketing agencies.
Over the course of the year we’ve returned almost $9 billion to shareholders including dividends of over $5 billion and 3.5 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back over 23 million shares, reducing our average share count by just under 2.5%, which is in line with our longer-term model. At the end of the year, we had $5.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.5 billion. Total debt was just over $42 billion, of which about two-thirds was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business is seven to one and the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 52% investment grade, a point better than September. I will come back to a change we’ll be making to the structure of our financing business starting in 2017.
Our non-financing debt of $14.3 billion was $2 billion lower than September, resulting in a non-financing debt-to-cap of just under 50%, five points lower than September, and more importantly five points lower than a year ago. Our debt-to-cap ratio was impacted again this year by a reduction in equity due to pension re-measurement, a $1.6 billion reduction to equity, or about three points to the ratio.
Looking at our pension plans, as you know the U.S. plan has been frozen for some time, and the asset mix reflects that, with a relatively low risk, low return profile. The result of that is low odds of any required funding in the U.S. regardless of the interest rate environment. Our funding levels remain solid with the U.S. and worldwide tax-qualified plans at 102% and 98% respectively, a modest increase from last year. Information on the performance of our retirement-related assets, and return and discount rate assumptions at year-end are in our supplemental charts.
Importantly, our balance sheet continues to have the strength and flexibility to support our business over the long term.
So now let me spend just a minute on our financing business. As part of our own transformation, we saw an opportunity to drive some operational benefits by changing the structure of our financing business.
First, let me say that the structure of the Global Financing segment that we report is unchanged. We have reorganized our client and commercial financing business as a wholly owned subsidiary, IBM Credit LLC. This combined corporate structure will, over time, meet its funding requirements by issuing debt directly to the market. This will drive operational benefits by consolidating the operations of our financing business. We will issue debt directly out of the new entity, and expect the entity to be able to access the capital markets later this year. And, we will increase our financing business leverage from seven to one to nine to one, which represents an increase of about $600 million in Global Financing debt.
But as I said, our Global Financing segment is unchanged, and will continue to include our client and commercial financing business as well as our hardware remanufacturing and remarketing business.
So let me wrap this up. We have a very clear point of view on what it takes to be successful with enterprise clients in this new era. I’ll shorthand it as cognitive, plus cloud, plus industry. And what differentiates IBM is the ability to bring all three together, to change real business processes and outcomes. Enterprise clients rely on us to help them run their processes. We have the relationships, we know their process and workflows, and importantly, we have their trust. This incumbency positions us very well to take our clients to the new era.
In 2016 we continued to make a lot of progress in the transformation of our own business. We had strong growth in our strategic imperatives, cloud, analytics, security and mobile. These offerings generated $33 billion in revenue, and now represent over 40% of our revenue. And they’re high value offerings, with a gross margin that raises overall IBM.
We also invested at a high level, through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships. In 2016 we spent nearly $6 billion in R&D, nearly $4 billion in capital expenditures, and nearly $6 billion to acquire 15 companies. We’re amassing a unique set of assets to build our cognitive solutions and cloud platforms, like the digital assets of The Weather Company, healthcare datasets from Truven and risk and compliance experts of Promontory. In 2016 we continued to remix our skills to new opportunities, while continuing to deliver innovation in our more traditional areas, like positioning z Systems as the ideal platform for blockchain, or Power for cognitive, or utilizing our intellectual property partnerships to extend some of our software assets.
So we’ll take all of these capabilities into 2017. Even recognizing the shifts in our industry, some country-specific challenges and opportunities, and some macro effects of currency and potential tax reform, as I said up front, we feel that we’re exiting 2016 in a stronger position than we entered it.
This confidence is reflected in our view of 2017. To simplify, we expect to stay on track in our strategic imperatives. We’ll continue to invest at a high level, though as you saw in the fourth quarter, after ramping investment from 2015 through late 2016, we’ve wrapped on that higher level. And we expect to grow our pre-tax income, and while there are a number of scenarios for tax, in all cases we expect tax to be a year-to-year headwind to our book rate in 2017. Put it all together, and we expect to deliver Operating EPS of at least $13.80 in 2017.
If you remember the first quarter of last year, we had a few larger items in our earnings, but they offset at the net income level. That first quarter was about 17% of our 2016 operating EPS. We expect a benefit from discrete tax again in the first quarter of this year, though smaller in size. And like last year, other actions will offset some portion of the benefit. With this, we expect a similar skew for 2017, with about 17% of the full year expectation of $13.80 in the first quarter.
Looking at cash flow for the year, we expect free cash flow realization in excess of 90% of GAAP net income, and we’ll return 70% to 80% of our cash flow to shareholders, both in line with our longer term model.
Bottom line, we feel good about the progress we made in 2016, and our prospects for 2017. And now, we’ll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the full year. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.
So let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Katy Huberty
Thank you, good afternoon. Just quick clarification and then I have question. The clarification is just it would helpful if you gave a little more insight as to what you’re expecting in terms of the range of outcomes for the tax rate both normalized rate and how much discrete items could be in the year and then similar for IP income just because those were so significant in 2016?
And then as it relates to my question which is on Watson, from the outside it seems this business gets pretty significant share of the press, but not contributing to revenue. Do you have visibility at as to when we should expect an inflection in revenue recognition from Watson, or should we just not think about this as a contributing factor or moving the needle in our models over the next couple of years?
Martin Schroeter
Okay, thanks Katy. A couple of things, on tax when we look at, as I in the prepared remarks, we do see tax as a headwind year-to-year, but remember we had last year a $1 billion, we won a tax case in Japan, so over $1 billion, which was in last year. That drives, by the way the bulk of the year-to-year headwind.
On a rate basis we finished this year we said 18 plus or minus 2, and we finished kind of at the bottom end of that range for the full year on an operating base obviously with on all in base with that Japan benefit from the first quarter and there it’s much lower, but we finished at the bottom end of that range. When we look at 2017, as I said in the prepared remarks all the scenarios point to a headwind. We’re right now thinking it’s about 15 plus or minus 3, and the reason we widened the range is because we are getting ready for tax reform here in the U.S. We don’t know yet what that looks like, we read the same things you do, but we are going to start now to prepare for tax reform, so we’ve widened the range this year to 15 plus or minus 3. That doesn’t have discretes in it.
On IP income as we said a number times we are trying to rebuild that base of business, it’s always been part of our income stream, it is a business where we’ve now had fair bit of success in rebuilding it and while we’re not relying on a big growth year-to-year, we do have in that particular line. A lot of this is already done quite frankly because we have these agreements in place that pay us royalties. And then we have a pretty good pool of opportunities that could get this back to again the same level that we printed this year. Again we’re not relying on that to within our guidance. Within our guidance I’d say we could be down year-to-year little bit. But again a lot of this is already done and we have a good pool of opportunities to drive IP again for what will be what 18 or 19 years of doing this. So we got, I think, a pretty good track record.
And then on Watson, Watson is in and you can see it in the Solutions Software business which accelerated. Again Watson, our Solutions Software is what’s being – or Watson is what’s driving that. Now Watson is a silver thread, it runs through the platform, it runs through Watson Health, it runs through Watson IoT, it’s in security now, right Watson is embedded in security.
And as we announced at the end of last year at Watson Financial Services, we will now embed the regulatory expertise of Promontory into Watson, so Watson will be part of that Financial Services industry solution content as well. So Watson is firmly, firmly established as the silver thread that runs through those cognitive solutions and you can see all of that in the solution software performance.

Thanks Katy let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. Martin, your free cash flow conversion of 90% plus in 2017 leads to about $10.2 billion at least in free cash flow, which is substantially down year-on-year. Can you help bridge the puts and takes here or what are the largest moving pieces to that conversion rate…
Martin Schroeter
No, I mean. Thanks, Wamsi. I guess the way I look at free cash flow conversion. As you know we guide on a conversion metric. But we see free cash flow basically flat year-to-year in 2017, not down. Now again, we give a range and that’s consistent with the model we have of being north of 90%, 90% to 100%. But we see free cash flow for the year to be flat. Now within that, as you know again we got our money back from Japan last year when we won our tax case so we’ve got that as a headwind. And within that and we’ll overcome that with the rest of the operations. But the other side of this is, we also holding if you will an ability to grow our capital investments within that flat as well. So it was not I mean you shouldn’t interpret that 90% is down, we see free cash flow flat with a tax headwind which will overcome and room to grow CapEx.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Wamsi. Sam. Can we go to the next question, please?

Next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess my question broadly and we give this a fair amount is IBM’s gross margin profile over the last several quarters. Especially across the cognitive segment specifically, but broadly has degraded pretty consistently. I realize you guys have a lot of investments but also is it organic but just talk about when do you think gross margins start to stabilize. And at what point do you think at least on the cognitive side the acts as-a-service business start to become more in line to the cognitive segment margin profile.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, thanks. Okay, sure. So on cognitive solutions, its been a year that you really have to go back to understand where we finished in the fourth. And I’m going to talk specifically about the fourth in a moment but you have to go back to what we’ve been talking about within cognitive solutions all year. So in the first quarter we saw the steepest year-to-year decline in margins, driven by a heavily by our investments – heavily by our need to remix our skills. And also by we had acquisitions and while currency was a big headwind in dollars for us last year was also an impact to our margin.
So as we progressed through the year when we get the fourth. On a gross profit margin basis we were down about three points which I would put in currency and acquisitions is all of that three. And so on a PTI margin basis in the fourth we were down about less about half, little bit less than half about 1.4 points. And within that again currency and acquisitions drove three points so everything else in cognitive solutions within the PTI margin.
The mix of the annuity business the ramp of our as-a-service business, the benefit we get from our licensing our IP and the offsetting royalties that are coming. And everything else improved operating PTI margin in the fourth quarter. And so what you saw in 2016 in cognitive segment margins on PTI was an operating margin that went up pretty dramatically as we went quarter-to-quarter like 17 points, right from first all the way to fourth.
And next year, I don’t know when currency is going to ramp but we do know it’s much less of a headwind next year than it was this year at least at current rates. And we also know that we ramp on the acquisitions. So those things that have dragged us dragged our margins down are starting to go away and while gross profit. We don’t see that I don’t see that deteriorating by three points like it did in the fourth anymore. And in fact PTI margins I think are much, much more stable going forward, which is what we’re assuming. Now they don’t have to be flat, we’re still going to drive our as-a-service performance we are going to continue to drive these IP deals, which throw a little bit of royalty into the GP stream but I see a much improved cognitive segment PTI margin from what we experienced in the fourth. And again you saw in the fourth we ramped on our heavy investment levels here as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Amit. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Tien-tsin Huang
Thank you so much. Just wanted to – I guess better understand this global financing change and what’s driving that. Are you increasing your leverage to support clients and anything needs in 2017 or is it just a tool to lie [ph] to increase your debt overall leverage and efficiencies just want to better understand that.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks Tien-tsin. So there are some really important benefits here as we align kind of the legal and the capital structure of our financing business that just by itself will drive pretty substantial operational benefits. It gives us better capital structure flexibility in each of the countries in which IGF operates. IGF by the way doesn’t operate in 172 like all of IBM does its more like 45 but it allows for better capital structure in that more limited set of countries in which they operate. It gives us better efficiency of cash allocation.
So what – we are really doing here as we are taking the interest earning part of IGF, the client financing and the commercial financing, we put those into a subsidiary. We will provide – be providing more information externally. So you can see everyone can see what the capacity for them to borrow and that’s really the borrowing capacity of IGF the remarketing business does not support a borrowing capacity its a very high margin, it’s a very high return but the interest bearing portion of IGF is really what supports the debt. 
And so we’re going to issue debt directly out of that entity. It’ll allow us to add $600 million or so of debt because that portfolio was high enough quality that it can run at higher leverage. That’s by the way more consistent with what we see in other entities of this nature. So we’ll run it slightly higher leverage that will improve the ROE, that will free up basically some equity if you will that we have in IGF it will free up some equity in mainline. But it’s not a change to necessary to the overall debt levels it’s really a change to IGF and its efficiency the operational benefits we get and our ability then to pull a little bit of capital out of idea. But also manage it better in which in the countries in which it operates. But again importantly the segment that you see won’t change. So this really is a change in how we access the capital markets externally.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Tien-tsin. Sam, can we take the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes, thank you. Martin if I think about 2016 in total relative to your guidance at the beginning of the year it benefited about $1.20 in EPS from IP gains and lower tax rate not including the Japanese tax settlement. So on a fundamental basis, earnings went from about $14.02 in 2015 to about $12.50 in 2016. So as we look to 2017, you’re guiding for an improvement in earnings from $13.50 to $13.80. And you said tax is going to be a headwind, you’ve said IP income is not going to help if anything it might hurt. So the last three years you’ve actually had fundamental erosion if we take out tax and IP in your business.
And you’re calling for an inflection point in 2017. So I’m wondering if you can talk through what are the key things that drive that improvement and perhaps you could also be explicit about what your expectation for acquisitions and their contribution for restructuring expense and whether that will be a net, we’ll have any net impact on results and what your assumption is for cash tax versus accrue tax in 2017 as well? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Okay, sure. Thanks Toni. So a couple of things when we entered 2016 as I said earlier on a prior question, we said tax would be 18 plus or minus two and we came in again at the bottom of the range. And so now when we look at tax, yes, we had $1 billion improvement from Japan, which we are not – obviously we’re not going to win another tax case in Japan by the way. But we do have discrete this year.
When we look at where we finished, we finished at the bottom of that range. And as I said with us going into now 2015 into 2017 at a 15 rate plus or minus three we have to overcome if you will the headwind from the Japan. But we’re going to as we plan for tax reform we don’t see a fundamentally different operating tax picture than we saw last year in our I&E. We saw an inflection point it’s probably you know maybe that’s the right way to think about it. We saw an inflection point in intellectual property income this year. And I can tell you that yes, we see an inflection point in profitability our PTI we expect to improve that’s embedded within our earnings.
So we saw an inflection point in IP income but then you get to the engineer and you want to take it all out. So that we hit an inflection point in IP last year, we did better than we had the prior year. And it’s always been a part of our model and again we see while it may not continue exactly we’re not relying on all of that for the year. We will have IP income a substantial amount of IP income as we always have for the last I don’t know 18, 19 years you have the history as well.
So we do see an inflection point in our margin profile remember that we have gotten a lot done this year in terms of getting margins stabilized. We see that for instance in our infrastructure services business which drew margins for the year. We did get wrapped if you will on the higher levels of investment and spending and you see that in our cognitive solutions and I talked about that earlier. So and you see it on in our E2R [ph] performance on SG&A for instance in the fourth quarter alone. So as we get into now – as we get into 2017 and all of the work we got done plus we’ve got a better base on which our as-a-service margins are still continuing to grow because we’re not where we wants to be yet but we did improve throughout the year.
We have a momentum if you will in our cognitive solutions business and again those are high value. And we’ll get all the – whatever savings if we have from workforce rebalancing both as we continue to remix our workforce. So yes, I am saying that PTI margin and PTI growth this year is what is implied in our guidance now with the tax headwind it doesn’t translate as much to EPS growth but we do see the inflection points in parts of our business and including our margin profile.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you. Can we go to the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is now open.
Lou Miscioscia
Okay, great. Thank you. You maybe go into more detail in GBS like the last quarter you had said that over 50% of the revenue has transitioned into the digital practice area and that was growing in double-digits. So looking at this quarter obviously it seems like it’s fallen back a little bit, many others are growing application management just if you can help us out what’s going on under the coverage there why it seems that which should have improved in – obviously it didn’t and what you think about that going forward.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks, Lou. So the dynamics in GBS were similar to what we talked about in prior quarters we said a couple of things. One we are continuing to remix their skills and while we have a good performance in our strategic imperatives and that those digitized offerings. We still do have a pretty large book of business that’s in our part of the marketplace that has very heavy price pressure as all of us are competing to get kind of that foothold if you will or competing for certain kinds of opportunities and some of these accounts. So we’ve got price pressure in parts of the business and again we’re remixing our skills which as we said will have an impact the shorter term impact on productivity.
Now shorter term we invest in businesses for a long, long periods of time. So I don’t define shorter term is every 90 days. Although this business this business should start to improve when we – as we’ve talked about last time when we see a couple of things. So the backlog in GBS is down and so our first focus has to be to take the skills we’re building and get a good signings, a good consistent signings performance in order to grow the backlog once you grow the backlog then obviously you deliver in an efficient and effective way. And you start to improve your margins and we still view GBS is being able to get that done in fact. We’d say we will grow signings in the first quarter this year. So maybe we’ll start that position now but we still see this business and these skills at such a key differentiator in the marketplace that. We’re unwilling if you will to reduce our capacity or our capabilities in the marketplace. We really this is the third leg if you will between cognitive and a robust cloud. Industry skills are going to – what brings it all together so GBS is in a similar dynamic. I do think will grow signings in the first which will be the start to having that business improve. But it’s going to take a little while longer to get through these same dynamics, our remixing skills and moving our skills away from these heavily priced pressured opportunities.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Lou. Sam, can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Brian White with Drexel Hamilton. You may ask your question.
Brian White
Hey, Martin. So it sounds like the PTI margin will expand in the 2017, maybe just look at gross margins. You think gross margins will expand and if you can just give us a view on – the major business segments where should we expect improvement in the PTI margin in 2017? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks Brian. So a couple of things, we have is as we always, do we have a bunch of scenarios on how a year might fold out, roll out, right. So I would say that as you pointed out PTI margin expansion is in every scenario. That’s evidenced by the fact that profit is growing, it’s implied to grow with the tax headwind and then EPS obviously with a little bit of growth. So PTI margin growth is in each of the scenarios.
GP margin is not necessarily required for us to grow PTI margin and that’s for a couple. Now I’m not saying that peak that GP is necessarily going to go down but we can maintain our GP margins, we can even erode a little bit if we want to accelerate our move into as-a-service even faster. As you saw we had very good growth in our – as-a-service business in the fourth.
Overall those margins are below our IBM margin, so there’s a little bit of margin pressure as you make that shift, but we can deliver 2017 push as-a-service margins it’s really hard either maintain or you can even contract GP margins a little bit and still grow PTI margins given that we’ve ramped on, again this heavy level of investment and we’ve gotten a lot done on structure both the overall IBM structure, the infrastructure of what runs IBM, as well as each of the business have taken another good look at structure.
So from a segment perspective we saw good performance in our global technology services business. When you look at the infrastructure services piece growth and margins for the full year and I’d say that we can see opportunity to continue to grow margins there. The technical support services, the TSS business is where the margin pressure was in 2016, but I think we have a way to stabilize that margin performance, a very much is a mix shift from as we drive the multi vendor services business in TSS.
So margin improvements in the infrastructure services business I see relatively flat profit margins and systems. Now we’re coming off of a high point in the mainframe. At the end of the cycle margins tend to be higher. As you go into a new cycle they tend to be a little bit lower. But we also have an opportunity to improve in the other businesses. So systems margins relatively flat and we see again an opportunity to improve margins in GBS. As we get some of the work that I’ve described they are done and get kind of the power to shift through the way, we can see improvements in GBS.
And I talked earlier about cognitive solutions, so I won’t cover that again. So again PTI we do see growing. GP not necessarily, we don’t need GP to grow in order to produce PTI margin growth.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Brian. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is now open.
Steve Milunovich
Thank you very much. Martin, I think you talked about $2 billion of savings from the workforce rebalancing and so forth a year ago. I was curious how much of that did you see last year, how much of it is going to be seen in 2017, and how much of that in 2017 May you take to the bottom line because that strikes me, that’s a big part of this PTI improvements.
And also just wanted to ask and you might want to actually respond to this that where are you in the innings in your transformation. It’s been a number of years now. How far into it are you? And then just qualitatively what surprised you positively and what’s been very difficult to change in terms of changing IBM.
Martin Schroeter
Okay. Well, that’s a lot there Steve. So first on the workforce rebalancing savings, we said for last year, for 2016 that we would see a bit more than $500 million and we absolutely got that. And we said we would free up then $2 billion of total spend, some of which will get reinvested, some of which will go to the bottom line. You saw from our view of 2017 now that we’ve ramped, we’re not obviously reinvesting all of that although we ramped on our higher levels of spending, so obviously some of that’s going to wind up in the profit. And with mid single-digit profit growth it’s a fair bit drives that profit growth in 2017.
In the innings, you know what, IBM is always transforming. So I don’t know how to pick an inning other than to say that we have established a few years ago, we established this idea that the strategic imperatives were the path for revenue growth to resume and those continue to grow quite well. Then last year we changed the segment structure and said, look, we’re going to now report not only more detail on the strategic imperatives, but we’re going to talk to you about cognitive solutions which has all the Watson content. We’re going to talk to you about a cloud platform business and we’re going to talk to you obviously about the industry dimension.
And so that part of the transformation continuous and I don’t think that that transformation of IBM ever ends quite frankly. We are back now as we put in our guidance; we are back to our model level of pre-tax income growth as we have in our model right now. Now if you say that pre-tax income growth – if for the model – achieving the model is the definition of when the transformation is done, then I’d say that we see that this year for pre-tax income.
Now we’ve got a lot of other elements of our financial model as well. We’ve been returning cash to our shareholders consistently, we have generated our free cash flow as a percentage of our net income has been on model. So we’ve had a number of elements that are on model. Pre-tax income growth I think is a good one that says this structure, the strategy is working and it will drive the financial model we set out to achieve, at least on the pre-tax income growth which had been missing.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Steve. Can we please go to the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Joe Foresi
Hi, I thought I’d ask that progress question a little bit differently. Can you give us some thoughts on your expectations for growth in the strategic imperatives and the decline in the core business in 2017? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure Joe. So, we said a few years ago that strategic imperatives would be $40 billion and 40% by 2018 and as you just saw we finished 2016 when they’re 41%. So obviously we made the mix piece of this early. But from here if we grow, say, 10% to 11% we get to 40% by 2018. And so with such a substantial part now of our business at $30 billion plus with such a substantial part of our business to grow that at that continued double-digit says that we have the right offerings in the right spaces with the right skills to deliver them and they are robust powerful solutions. And so we see that kind of growth in order to get to the 40%. We still think we’re quite confident; we’re ahead actually of track, but we’re quite confident in getting to the 40% still.
The core business or the rest of the business if you will is always has a few components in it. One, at our very core, remember, that we are delivering productivity to our clients, and so they use that that productivity that we deliver to reinvest. And as we said before that’s the dynamic you see in our revenue stream. We deliver productivity through parts of our business and they reinvest and that’s how you get the revenue dynamic that we have.
The core was down double-digit two years ago and down 9% in the fourth, if you do the math roughly down 9%. And when we get into this year, I’d say that we’ll see a kind of a similar dynamic but that’s what we are – that’s what is sort of embedded within our guidance for 2017. So continued good performance in strategic imperatives, continued focus on delivering productivity for our clients and we’ll have that revenue dynamic into 2017.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Sam. Why don’t we take one last question?
Operator
Certainly. Our last question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.
David Grossman
Thanks. Actually Martin if I could just ask two questions really quickly. One is just into your last answer. So if you are growing at 11% in the strategic and you are pretty close to 50-50, I think you’re at 44% in the fourth quarter and the core is declining 9%. I mean wouldn’t that imply that we’re reasonably close to getting to a crossover on the top line.
Martin Schroeter
Did you want to ask your second question first, or do you want me to answer that one?
David Grossman
Well, the second – Why do you answer that first and then I will go to the second one.
Martin Schroeter
Okay. So when you say we were down on a constant currency basis, we were down 70 basis points in the fourth. So I think we are reasonably close in the third. Yes, this is the structure we are in. And we are focused on driving value in those strategic imperatives not just grabbing a little bit of revenue to have some math work out differently.
And our margins in the strategic imperatives continue to be higher than overall IBM and higher obviously than the core, so our focus on delivering value hasn’t changed. And whenever that crossover point happens to be, yes, we’re already close. So when you say wouldn’t it imply, yes, we’re close, we were close in the fourth. But we’re focused on delivering value, and for 2017 we’re focused on obviously PTI margin expansion.
David Grossman
Right. And the second piece is, if historical trend repeats itself, you’re due for a mainframe product cycle in the back half of the year. I believe the way you break it out at least some of that mainframe revenue is in strategic imperatives. So that said how should we be thinking of the potential financial impact of the next mainframe cycle vis-a-vis prior cycles, particularly given some of the secular shifts that you’ve talked about in your prepared remarks and in response to some of the other question?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. So, yes, I mean, we – if you follow a mainframe cycle then it would say sometime late this year we’d have another mainframe. But again, we wouldn’t see the impact of that until late in the year. What drives the mainframe as it always has is our ability to make it relevant to the workloads that our clients need.
So when we were together when we announced the last mainframe, and two years ago we talked a lot about this shift to mobile. We talked a lot about security. We talked within those two elements and there’s a lot more to it. But within those two elements we talked about how the mainframe was built particularly with those two kinds of workloads in mind and that drove the growth we saw in the mainframe through the cycle. That’s still by the way part of the growth we see in the mainframe and it’s still why – that’s why big enterprises continue to put their most important work on mainframes.
Now the set of workloads that are going to drive the next incantation of the mainframe are going to be things like Blockchain, and so all of that is still ahead of us. We added and we said in the prepared remarks, we added a number of new clients throughout the cycle but we added more again in the fourth quarter as well.
And while I haven’t talked to every one of them, I think what they’re thinking, what many of them are thinking is yes, I need mobile, and yes, security is more important than ever, but I also need to be ready for the next workload drivers. And Blockchain is a good example of a workload driver that is ideally suited for the most robust enterprise platform there is. So I think that if I had to pick just one that drives the mainframe is Blockchain. It would be my first top of my list for what drives the next mainframe cycle.
So let me wrap up the call by saying again that we’re really pleased with the progress we made in 2016 and how we’re positioned for 2017. Of course there’s plenty for us to work on, we’re not confused by that. But we are looking forward to continuing this dialogue at our investor briefing later in the quarter.
So with that, thank you for joining the call.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. In the third quarter, we generated $19.2 billion in revenues, $3.7 billion in pre-tax income and $3.29 of operating earnings per share. As we think back to the discussion 90 days ago, it was around Brexit and its impact on Europe, global spending and sectors like banking and the attractiveness of investment in the emerging markets, all of these topics have the capacity to drive some volatility and results, but what you see in our third quarter results is stability in our revenue with continued strong growth and strategic imperatives and a top and bottom line consistent with what we expected.
Our revenue was essentially flat relative to last year. Looking at the revenue dynamics, I want to point out a few things. Our clients are focussed on becoming digital businesses and have strong growth in cloud, security, mobile, and across our analytics portfolio reflects this. In total, we continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our strategic imperatives led by our cloud business.
Cloud delivered as-a-service is part of a solid recurring revenue base across software and services, and our annuity revenue continued to grow. Of course, the acquisitions we made in the last 12 months contributed to growth about the same amount as last quarter and for the first time in quite a while currency was a modest tailwind to revenue growth. I’ll talk to our revenue at constant currency going forward.
Looking at revenue from a segment perspective, we had very good performance in both cognitive solutions and technology services and cloud platforms. Cognitive solutions were up 5% and within that solution software was up 8%. Technology services and cloud platforms revenue also grew with continued strength in our infrastructure services and growth in integration software as we help our clients build hybrid cloud capabilities. And with another quarter of signings growth our GTS backlog is up year-to-year.
Global business services made some progress this quarter in revenue trajectory as we continue to shift and mix to a digital offerings. Our systems revenue was down this quarter. The z Systems performance reflects the fact that we are seven quarters into the product cycle where POWER reflects the secular decline in UNIX mitigated by growth in Linux. There is a tremendous amount of change in our industry and we are continuing to invest where we see the best opportunities.
With this, we are addressing new opportunity areas and building new markets as well as delivering innovation in our existing businesses. We are investing organically and we are acquiring key capabilities. We are remixing their skills, and we’ve had success in rebuilding our IP income base, utilizing partnerships that enable us to continue to innovate in some of the more traditional high value areas of the business.
With all of that, we continue to have a very high margin business and we generate a lot of profit in cash. Our results reflect the success we are having and helping our clients to leverage cloud for speed and innovation and become cognitive businesses. You see this in the growth in our strategic imperatives which were up 15%.
Over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered nearly $32 billion in revenue and now represent 40% of IBM. We had strong performance in our cloud offerings which were up over 40% led by our as-a-service offerings. We exited the third quarter with an as-a-service run rate of $7.5 billion. That’s up from $6.7 billion last quarter and the bulk of the increases organic. So we are building scale in these businesses.
We also had strong revenue performance in security and in mobile and we had strong growth in our analytic offerings which were up 14% this quarter with contribution from the core analytics platform to cognitive offerings including Watson platform, Watson Health and Watson IoT.
We are building the industry’s broadest and deepest cognitive solutions and cloud platform portfolio and we are extending our capabilities. For example, this quarter we continued the global expansion of our cloud footprint and we now have 49 cloud centers. We formed a partnership with Workday, where IBM cloud will become the foundation for Workday’s development and testing environment. And we extended our partnership with VMware to enable easy hybrid cloud adoption.
As we’ve talked about in the past, cognitive is about using data and adding intelligence into products and services to help clients make better decisions. It’s about augmenting human intelligence. This quarter, we introduced and expanded Watson platform offerings including Watson conversation service and Watson virtual agent for customer service. We are training Watson for cyber security, expanding the amount of security data Watson is injecting. In Watson Health, we launched Watson for drug discovery and Watson Health core and in Watson IoT we added new capabilities around block chain and security to draw insights from billions of sensors embedded in everything from machines to cars, to drones to ball bearings to buildings and even to hospitals.
Where we are seeing real value is in providing cognitive capabilities in the IBM cloud, the third critical element of our strategy is our industry focus, and in the third quarter we introduced an industry platforms business that integrates cloud, cognitive industry and ecosystems capabilities to provide targeted solutions in specific industries. Initially industry platforms will address two substantial opportunity areas, once in financial services and block chain solutions. We believe block chain has the potential to do for trusted transactions what the internet did for information. We are building a complete block chain platform and are now working with over 300 clients to pioneer block chain for business, including CLS, who settles $5 trillion per day in the currency markets to implement a distributed ledger in support of its payment netting service and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi for smart contracts to manage service level agreements and automate multi party transactions.
And in the third quarter, we opened the block chain innovation center in Singapore to accelerate block chain adoption for finance and trade and we now have block chain garages opened in New York, London, Tokyo, Singapore and San Francisco.
In Watson Financial Services just a couple of weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, a leader in regulatory compliance and a risk management consulting. So just as we trained Watson on clinical research and medical guidelines to work with doctors treating cancer, we will apply the expertise of Promontory to train Watson to directly address escalating regulations, their risk management requirements in financial services.
I’ll expand on some of these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions, but first let me walk through our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was $19.2 billion. As I just mentioned currency was a modest tail wind to growth, about 80 basis points this quarter.
On a geographic basis, we had sequential improvements in both the Americas and Europe. The Americas revenue was flat as compared to last year and the U.S. was also flat. Latin America was up 5% led by Brazil. While the environment remains uncertain, double-digit growth of Brazil this quarter reflects the importance of our z Systems platform to the banking sector.
Europe performance improved four points sequentially, driven by the U.K. Germany, France and the Nordics. Asia Pacific decelerated including a decline in Japan and weaker performance in China. India continued to post strong results. Our gross margin was down this quarter, across the business the decline is driven by higher level of investments including the acquisitions we have made and the mix to as-a-service businesses that aren’t yet at scale. I’ll address the margin dynamics that are segment specific within the segment discussions.
Our expense overall is down versus last year. I want to spend a minute on a few of the expense drivers. We’ve been investing at a higher level, both in organic capabilities like cognitive, security, cloud and block chain but also through acquisitions. When we look at the acquisitions we have done over the last 12 months, this drove about five points of expense growth.
As we look at our investment levels, we want to allocate our skills to where we see the most opportunity in growth. Some of our assets are high value, but not necessarily in growing markets, so we are licensing not selling our intellectual property to partners who are allocating their skills to extend the value of these assets.
This quarter, we signed three such agreements resulting in a higher level of IP income. Licensing as a part of a broader partnership to drive future innovation is a relatively new model for us. It allows us to retain and potentially grow the revenue stream while shifting our spending profile to a more variable cost structure. IP income is just one way that we monetize our technology, sometimes selling our intellectual property, other times licensing IP.
The last thing I want to mention relative to expense is that we continue to have a year-to-year impact from currency, not only from the translation, but also as we wrap on last years’ hedging gains. This drove a three point impact to expense, so while currency is a modest help to the top line, we continue to have a meaningful impact to our year-to-year profit. Put it all together, and our reported expense is better 2% versus last year.
Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an ongoing effective tax rate of 18% for the year which is in line with the expectation we discussed at the beginning of the year of 18% plus or minus a couple of points. It also includes a discreet benefit for closure of our foreign tax audit which lowered the tax rate in the quarter by two points.
From a cash perspective, we generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and nearly $13 billion over the last 12 months. This was over 100% of our GAAP net income and over the same period we returned about two thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Now turning to our segments, our cognitive solutions revenue was up 5% which is a sequential improvement from the second quarter’s rate. Our solutions software revenue was up 8% while transaction processing software was down 2%. Analytics was a growth driver and we grew revenue in all spectrums of Watson. We saw strong SAS performance with double digit growth in revenue. Overall, gross margin was down due to the mix shift to SAS and the acquisition content.
Our pre tax income performance also reflects ongoing higher levels of investment in strategic growth areas like our Watson businesses. Our Analytics business which is the largest portion of the solution software portfolio grew again in key areas such as information integration, big data and Watson.
Watson underpins our cognitive strategy and continues to gain momentum. Watson’s conversation service launched in July provides developers a simple and easy entry into the next generation of engagement, through quick set up and tooling developers without deep machine expertise can leverage the science of Watson to develop engagement experiences across multiple channels. We introduced our Watson virtual agent for customer service building on our conversational capability to provide a cognitive repeatable application trained for customer service.
For example, we recently announced that the Royal Bank of Scotland will begin using a Watson Powered Chatbot for customer service. The Chatbot will help seamlessly route customer service request through the correct channels and answer specific banking queries.
Turning to our vertical plays, we are focussed on scaling our Watson Health business. We have over 7000 employees and target four major areas, life sciences, oncology, imaging and value based care. We launched new offerings, such as Watson for drug discovery which is a cloud based scalable platform that helps life science researchers discover new disease pathways, new drug targets and additional drug indications. We had several major client wins, including UPMC and Best Doctors.
And earlier this month, we announced a strategic alliance with Siemens, to help health care providers deliver value based care-to-patients with chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer. With Siemens, we’ll focus on accelerating U.S. adoption of Watson’s population health management offerings. Siemens will use the Watson Health Cloud as its preferred global technology platform. We’ve also been growing our geographic footprint, expanding it to China, South Korea, Finland and the United Kingdom this quarter alone.
Hospitals in both China and South Korea announced plans to adopt Watson for our oncology. And in Finland, we announced a partnership with the Finnish government that will utilize Watson cognitive computing to help doctors improve the health of its citizens. Their vision is to build an open health care ecosystem based on compliant and efficient utilization of healthcare data, so Finland will put their healthcare data on our Watson Health Cloud.
When you think about an entire country and trusting us with its healthcare data, this should give you some perspective as to how clients believe we have the right technology and consider us a trusted partner to drive healthcare innovation. This builds on a similar announcement we made with the government of Italy earlier this year.
We also made great progress in Watson IoT. We opened our German location where we will co-create with our clients. We added new capabilities to our offerings. So now you can share IoT data from connected devices on a block chain, proactively identify potential security risks and protect devices, and tap the Watson IoT platform to develop new voice interfaces for customers all by leveraging these capabilities. IBMs leadership in IoT was recently highlighted by IDC. We more than doubled the number of new clients on our IoT platform in the quarter including Schaeffler and Thomas Jefferson University hospital.
Schaeffler, one of the world’s leading automotive suppliers based in Germany is using Watson IoT to transform its business from its supply chain through to manufacturing and sales. This is a good example of how deeply embedded into our clients businesses we are becoming down to the ball bearing themselves. We are seeing exponential growth in both devices and developers and now we are expanding our industry differentiation and our reach with Watson Financial services.
As I mentioned last month, we announced plans to acquire Promontory. Together, we will create cognitive solutions for risk and compliance. Global business services delivered $4.2 billion of revenue with a one point improvement in growth trajectory from last quarter. Our digital practises which now make up more than half of GBS were up double digits with strong growth in cloud analytics and mobile. Our cloud practise was up nearly 70% this quarter as we build and implement digital strategies to move our clients to the cloud.
By line of business, we grew 2% in application management driven by growth in our digital foundation and mobile platforms. This was offset by a decline in consulting revenue as some larger contracts went down and clients continue to move away from on-premise enterprise application work to new business models focused on digital and cloud.
Enterprises are looking for new ways to reach their customers and empower their employees to make faster decisions. We continue to see strong double digit growth in our enterprise mobility that are helping clients redesign work flows with specific industry context. Our growing collection of mobile first for our IoS applications are delivered on the cloud and can connect back to their core systems and infrastructure. This is reinventing the way employees make real time decisions by putting the POWER of the enterprise in their hands. We continue to bring new customers onto the platform, including VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, RIMAC Insurance in Peru, and Amica Insurance here in the U.S.
We also opened a new IBM mobile first garage in Bangalore, part of the network of centers that helps clients around the world achieve mobile-led digital transformations, at speed and at scale.
Turning to profit, GBS gross profit margin was down 90 basis points. We expanded margins and application management as we mixed a new cloud in digital platforms. And with the benefit from our work force rebalancing actions, we are driving productivity in our delivery model. Consulting gross profit margin was down reflecting the investments we are making to grow our digital practises. Also, there were some accounts that required additional spending to deliver on important commitments; these dynamics are also reflected in our PTI margin. We are continuing to shift the business as we’ve added nearly 10,000 resources over the past year to our strategic imperatives. The acquisitions we have done over the last year impact our near term profit but add important capabilities, like cloud consulting skills around workday in salesforce.com. We’ve also expanded the IBM Interactive experience in our digital design capabilities. We are focussed on integrating and scaling these new skills as we continue to expand our digital practises.
Technology services and cloud platforms delivered $8.7 billion of revenue and grew 1% year-to-year. Global technology services again grew signings and backlog and has now grown revenue for six consecutive quarters. As we shift from systems integration to services integration we continue to see momentum in our new offerings. Across the segment our strategic imperatives were up over 40% with cloud up over 50% and the as-of-service runrate up over 60%.
Looking at the lines of business, infrastructure services was up 2% as our hybrid cloud strategy continues to resonate with our clients. We provide enterprise grade cloud solutions that are secure, agile and leverage the data and investment in their core systems. We continue to expand our cloud infrastructure announcing the opening of new cloud centers in South Korea and Norway this quarter. We now have 49 centers around the world enabling low latency connectivity to cloud infrastructure.
And moving to the cloud, our clients need to be sure that data is secure. Those in regulated industries need to know where their data is and many need to keep it in country. Our cloud infrastructure allows clients automatically to provision virtual with bare metal service while meeting their data sovereignty and regulatory requirements.
At JFE Steel, one of the largest steel manufacturers in the world, we announced the five year outsourcing agreement that will migrate core systems to the IBM cloud through a hybrid solution that will consolidate their infrastructure and streamline business operations. This will allow the company to speed up system development and services deployment, strengthen IT governance and reduce cost.
And last week, we announced a new cloud object storage service that will enable clients to scale large unstructured data volumes across hybrid cloud environments. Italy has adopted this new object storage service to more quickly and easily analyse data that’s being produced by the more than the 10 million clicks it processes each month.
Looking at the software component of our hybrid cloud solutions, integration software grew 4%. We saw a continued strength in our connect products that integrate applications, data and processes for on-premise and cloud environments. We also grew in some of our mission critical offerings such as Webster application server. We continued to shift more of our portfolio to another service model to our bluemix cloud platform which continues to scale across a broad catalog of high value services including cognitive, weather, internet of things and block chain APIs.
We continue to build our partnerships and eco systems to help clients move to the IBM cloud, through our partnership with VMware nearly a 1000 clients have begun moving their VMware environments to the IBM cloud including Marriott International, Clarient Global and Monitise. We are helping organisations extend existing workloads to the cloud in hours versus weeks or months.
Turning to profit, our gross margin for technology services and cloud platforms was about flat year-to-year. We expanded margins and infrastructure services as we see the benefit from productivity actions we’ve taken and continue to streamline our processes. We are investing in our technology and using our cognitive capabilities to shift to a more automated delivery model to improve performance and drive efficiencies.
Our technical support services margin declined, driven by the mix to our multi vendor support offerings. Our PTI margin also reflects these dynamics as well as the continued investments we are making to build out our cloud platforms.
Turning to our systems segment, there are some important market shifts in this business like spinning disc to flash, the rising importance of the hyperscale data market and new opportunities in block chain. We are shifting our business, delivering innovation in our offerings and introducing significant new capabilities. As always, our performance in the period is based on product cycle dynamics and portfolio transitions, and given where we are in the transitions and POWER and storage and in product cycles more broadly our revenue and profit is down after a strong 2015.
Our z Systems results reflect a product cycle dynamics, seven quarters into the z13 cycle; revenue was down while margins continue to expand. We continue to add new clients to the platform and we are introducing new technologies like block chain. We announced new services to make it easier to build and test block chain networks in a secure environment as we build our block chain platform it’s been engineered to run on multiple platforms but is optimized for scale, security and resilience on both the IBM mainframe and the IBM cloud.
As z Systems are well suited for these new workloads, due to its advanced security features that help protect data and ensure the integrity of the overall block chain networks. We are currently working with over 40 clients on pilot block chain used cases running on z.
Our POWER performance reflects both our performance in a declining UNIX market as well as our growth in a growing Linux market. While our margins were relatively stable at the high end of POWER, mid and low end margins were down, driving a decline in overall POWER margins.
We’ve been shifting our platform to address Linux and in the third quarter Linux grew at a double digit rate and faster than the market. It now comprises over 15% of our POWER revenue. Supporting that is their success with HANA where we are bringing in new clients and were replicating this strategy with others. This quarter, we expanded our Linux only server portfolio leveraging OpenPOWER partnerships to deliver a new high performance computing chip and system with NVIDIA GPU acceleration and new data optimized servers.
And our POWER architecture had another win, this time for a major hyperscale data center with one of the world’s largest internet providers based in China. And finally at the end of September, we introduced new POWER midrange in high end systems designed for hybrid cloud computing and flexible consumption models to transform on-premise IT to the cloud.
So in POWER, we are shifting to Linux while continuing to serve the high value UNIX base, but this is a long transition. In the near term we are focussed on stabilizing the margin base.
Storage hardware was down 9% this quarter reflecting the ongoing shift in value towards software. Gross margin is down reflecting both volume and price pressure. The hardware decline was mainly driven by low end and mid range traditional disc storage. Our high end disc storage grew this quarter. All flash array revenue grew as we have expanded our flash technology across our product portfolio. We recently rolled out new products and transition to a full suite of flash offerings making us competitively positioned, and while now in our system segment we also continue to see double digit revenue growth in software-defined storage, so across system, we're facing product cycle headwinds and some transitions in POWER and storage, while continuing to deliver important technologies and capabilities to address cognitive and cloud.
So now let me wrap up the segment discussion with the performance of software across our segments. Our total software revenue was $5.7 billion, up 3%. This is the third consecutive quarter of improvement in our software revenue growth trajectory.
We've got a broad software portfolio from solutions that provide cognitive, analytics and security solutions to core transaction processing, to connecting on-prem data and processes to private and public cloud environment, our software is open, running on IBM and non-IBM environments.
From a business area perspective this quarter, we had solid growth in cognitive solutions and integration software, while operating systems continue to be a drag in line with a longer term secular trend, across software, software annuity revenue was up mid single digits led by our SAS offerings.
Acquisitions contributed to our SAS growth, but SAS was up organically as well. Our transaction revenue decline mid-single digits which is a significant improvement in the trajectory as compared to the last several quarters, as its typically in the third quarter our transactional software content was less than 20% of our software revenue, but remember in the fourth quarter due to seasonality transactions represent a larger portion of the software revenue.
Moving on cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated $3.3 billion in cash from operations excluding our financing receivables. After $850 million of CapEx spend, we generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.
Through the first three quarters of the year, our free cash of $6.9 billion was a little lower than last year with lower tax payments largely offsetting the year to year operational performance. Through September our CapEx spending is consistent with last year.
As I mentioned earlier on a trailing 12 months basis our free cash flow was over 100% of our GAAP net income. This performance continues to support our expectation that we will deliver the high end of the full year free cash flow guidance range we provided earlier this years.
This includes the expected cash payments related to workforce rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year, as well as the expected tax payments in the fourth quarter. Looking at the uses of cash, so far this year we've invested nearly $5.5 billion in acquisitions.
We've acquired 12 companies, the largest being the digital assets of the Weather Company and Truven Health Analytics. In the last nine months we've return $6.6 billion shareholders including nearly $4 billion in dividends and we bought back almost 18 million shares. We ended September with just over 950 million shares outstand and $3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended September with $10 billion in cash and $42.5 billion in total debt, about $26 billion of our debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at about 7:1 and the portfolio remains strong at 51% investment grade.
Our non-financing debt to cap was about 54.5% which is essentially unchanged from December and down about four points from year ago. Our balance sheet continues to be well-positioned to support our business over the long term.
As I said upfront in an environment where there are lot of open questions our business is showing a lot of stability, that stability is driven by the kind of work we do for our clients. We're applying deep industry skills and innovative technologies to change real business processes and outcomes. This supports our ability to invest, to create new offerings in markets and our ability to find new ways to monetize our intellectual property.
In the third quarter, we made progress across our business with continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives, some moderation and declines in our core businesses, remixing our skills and adding new capabilities through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships.
You'll recall in July we said that we expected our second half EPS dynamics to be improved over the first and we laid out a half a dozen or so areas where we expected to drive that. Now based on our third quarter performance and view with the fourth we'd say the second half improvement is pretty much in line with our view 90 days ago.
While we may see a little less improvement from software revenue mix, we're more successful in monetizing our software through IP income. So bringing it all together and as we look at the full year we continue to expect to deliver at least $13.50 of operating EPS and free cash flow at the high end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year.
And so with that, we'll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I'd ask you to reframe from multi-part question. So let's please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may proceed with your question.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes. Thank you. Martin, I have hopefully straightforward clarification and then a question please. Just on the clarification the year-over-year IP gains were about $340 million or $0.30. And I appreciate that your licensing real software IP to get that, but how do we think about this has been sort of more one off rather than ongoing IP and should we be thinking of IP income increasing on an ongoing basis?
And similar, if you could just clarify the tax rate, I had 14:2 [ph] as your tax rate. You talked about two points being helped from a discrete tax item. Was there something else that was impacting the tax rate that appear to get it down to at least by my model something that's closer to 14%. So if you could clarify those two that would help.
And then the question is around free cash flow and how to think about it. This year you're going to be at the very high end into your range, probably free cash being a 100% or more than a 100% of GAAP net income. As we look forward next year given your guidance, is typically lower than that. Should we not be thinking about free cash flow declining in an absolute -- on an absolute basis in 2017?
Martin Schroeter
Okay. Well, I think I got them all, Toni. So, we'll do the clarifications first and we won't count that as a multi-part question, we'll count that as a multi-part clarification, and then we'll talk about free cash flow. So couple of things on IP and this is actually a really important point I think Toni, our IP income, our IP income has been flat to down over the last say three, four, five years and we've been thinking about how do we continue to drive IP income?
If you look back, and I'm sure you have all the data as well. If you back 15 years ago, we had as much as a $1.07 billion of IP income, now a lot of that was driven from the fact that we developed really good semiconductor manufacturers and really good semiconductor manufacturer processing technology and our ability to license that technology drove a lot of income. We have been thinking about how do we reinvigorate if you will the IP income business and part of it is what you'll see now as we're realizing some of these.
So, the clarification that you asked about, is it about 340 million year to year? Yes, that's right. That's about 340 million year to year. But more importantly, we are going to continue to drive IP income. Now, we got a good third quarter on a year to-date basis where about 1.01 billion, so we're kind of flat. I don't think that we have enough to set a new annual record when we look back at the $1.7 billion that we printed 15 years ago or so, but it is certainly a focus, and keep in mind I think that these are relationships, they are long term relationships, right. So, they are not all public as some of our partners don't want to talk about what they are doing. Those that our public, though their multi, multi year relationship where they can drive now some of the value that they see, they can capture within the marketplace.
We again, we license it to them, we don't sell it to them, so we have an interest going forward as well and can get some of the upside here. So this is a really -- it’s a terrific model, it's got a lot of legs. We see an opportunity for this over the next few years to continue doing this. So, I think that handles your clarification on tax. There are two points, your notes were right, two points were from the discrete piece of its. And then we are -- our view of the year now, because of the mix of our business has an operating ongoing effective rate of 18 plus or minus, which is where we were at the beginning of the year.
So, it's really a kind of a view of where the mix of our businesses looks for the rest of this year. On free cash flow your question, we have been running at a realization which is above our model. Now keep in mind we got – we won a tax case earlier in the year and that means we got our money back, right. So that was a pretty substantial inflow. But we also had some pretty substantial outflows in terms of our workforce rebalancing payments and things through the year. So, as we said in our guidance, we would expect to finish at the high of the guidance. We said that already 180 days ago. We still feel confident about our ability to generate cash.
As we start to look at next year, we don't see anything that fundamentally changes our realization from where we are in our model, so our model as you know is in the 90, so somewhere between 90% and 100% realization, and we don't see anything, knowing again everything we have now, everything we have now year to-date plus what's coming in the fourth, we don't see anything that would say our free cash flow realization is going to change. And so, when we get through now the fourth and we see where we are for 2017 and 90 days then we'll talk more about the absolutes, but we don't see anything in the realization that's going to drive our realization to be anything other than again 90% to 100% for next year.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
And our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Kathryn Huberty
Thanks. Good afternoon. You didn't close any major acquisitions this quarter and yet cognitive growth margin sell 400 basis points year on year, 200 basis points sequentially. Should we not expect to see improving margins as-a-service revenue scale on the fixed cost base of data centers? And then Martin just connected to that you mentioned that the one variance to your plan for the year is that the software business, margins are tracking the plan, can you maybe touch on why that it is? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. So, I'll address actually the second one first, Katy, so when we talked about first half to second half and we laid out where saw the business in the second half, one of those elements we had on that chart last quarter was the idea of software mix and as-a-service -- software mix and as-a-service margins and it would go – it would turn into a modest positive. And I would say that's more neutral now. So not a dramatic change and it really has to do with the mix of business, you know, we're getting the kind of growth rates we would expect. You saw third quarter we had software up 3, which is an acceleration from the prior quarter, but it really is that we're also seeing good momentum in our cloud platforms business, so it’s really a mix statement that is driving that as oppose to something happening within our software margins.
On the cognitive margin component the phenomena you described is absolutely accurate. As we slowdown those investments we'll see the as-a-service margin scale, we're starting to see the as-a-service business scale, but we still see so much opportunity we're going to keep driving the investments. And so we haven't gone to that point yet where the scale overtakes the investment levels in that as-a-service business.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Tien-tsin Huang
Great, thanks. Good afternoon. Just on the transactional sales down 5% in the third quarter, curious if there's any the line of sight here into this fourth quarter and what you might expect there in relationship to – in relation to which is on the third quarter maybe this is a question. Do we start to think about transactional sales and for the IP income, maybe together, I don't know if there is any correlation between the two in any way? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Tien-tsin, so a couple of things. The transactional business as we noted in the third, down five was an improvement from where we were in the second. So, we had reasonable transaction closing rates. Now, the thing to keep in mind as we go into the fourth, it is a much bigger transactional quarter for us and so while we have, what I would call a good opportunity pipeline, we have got now 85 days or a 75 days to see how the environment holds up and that will obviously drive the fourth quarter and drive the full year.
When we look at – when I look at the revenue streams in the fourth, our annuity business which again smaller pieces in the fourth. Our annuity business has been growing pretty consistently quarter, to quarter, to quarter and I would expect that growth to continue into the fourth that transactional business which is again much larger tends to get a pretty good quarter to quarter sequential bump if you will about $1.5 billion. And based on our opportunity pull, we'd say that looks about like what we'll get done in the fourth as well, but there is some uncertainty in environment and here in the U.S. we've got an election to get through, but right now I'd say that my line of sight into 4Q says, that quarter to quarter impact in third to fourth is about $2.5 billion as we had – just for that transactional business.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Tien-tsin. Sam, can we can take the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is open.
Steve Milunovich
Thank you. You talked quite bit about Watson. You've been running many Watson ads. I just wonder if you can give any updates from the Analyst Day on Watson. How much revenue are you generating? The revenue you do generate is it in the software or consulting buckets kind of relatively speaking that you expect going forward? You mentioned I think four, five ways, you're looking to monetize Watson at that meeting, I guess which ones are working. And you talked about it as a platform as well and I'm wondered if you consider running Watson on someone else's platform like on AWS?
Martin Schroeter
Okay. Steve, I'll start with the last question first and last answer to that question is no, Watson runs on our cloud and our technology and Watson will run on the IBM cloud. With regard to the progress we're seeing, we've talked a bit about and you've seen many of our announcement around where Watson is showing up and the kind of work it’s doing, all of that as you know gets reported within our strategic imperatives and all of it goes into the cognitive solutions space that's where our Watson Health business is, that's where our IoT business is, and that’s where the Watson platform is.
So, I'd say that with the cognitive solutions business we talked about it in total at plus five, the sub-segment of that where the Watson content shows up which we also provide is up eight, so good growth in that software solutions space. But keep in mind that we're also building new markets here and it's going to take some time for us to take the technologies and the processes that we bought for instant in our Watson Health business and now layer on the Watson technologies to get the ramp in growth that we expect to get out of some of them. So, yes, good progress, yes, it’s a long term investment, and all within that cognitive solutions segment and no, it's not going to run on anything but the IBM cloud.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is open.
Patricia Murphy
Lou, we can't hear you. You are on mute.
Lou Miscioscia
Hello.
Martin Schroeter
Well, there you are. Now we can hear you.
Lou Miscioscia
Okay. I hope it’s coming through okay. So on the software area which was up 3%, maybe can you go in there and just share with us what is organic, and would you say that we've actually gotten passed with flexible pricing situation that you've been obviously dealing with from negative growth standpoint for a couple of quarters or actually maybe about two years now?
Martin Schroeter
So, a couple of things, Lou on organic, as you said software up 3 and acceleration for where this -- there is across IBM, the acquisition impact was about the same as it was last quarter, about 2 points across all of the businesses. Now lot of those businesses are software, so obviously an impact in software in the quarter, but not dramatically different again from what we saw in the second. We have – we continue to have good annuity content performance, so our annuity business continues to grow.
The phenomena that we've talked about with regard to our largest customers is still part of the discussion with every large customer, it’s a question of how do they best view the deployment of their licenses. How do they best view the use of our technologies in order to make sure they are optimizing their own workloads, they make sure they are optimizing the projects they have going on.
One of the things and important thing to us is are they, to make sure that they're still using our software and are they still – are they still, for instance, paying us in [Indiscernible] and are they renewing that, and our renewal rates have stayed very high and very consistent through the third quarter as well, and so we're confident that our software business has the right appeal if you will to our clients, because they continue to use it, they continue to deploy it on any large customer basis, any large customer, the discussion could be a little bit different, but again good software performance in the quarter, some benefit from acquisitions, but I would expect that our annuity base will continue to keep growing as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Lou. Sam, can we go to next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. I have a quick clarification and a question as well. So, Martin when you alluded to sort of moving into this high transactional quarter in the fourth quarter, I think you alluded to about 2.5 billion sequential improvement quarter on quarter in that business, is that the baseline that is needed to achieve the 2013 and 2015 in guidance, that's my clarification. And for my question, if you think about sort of the unique one-time benefits in 2016 you had tax which was the big driver for first quarter. I know you had associated investments and then now you look at the third quarter there are some significant IP other income and I appreciate your comments around the increasing nature and sustainability of this.
And I know you're not guiding it to 2017, but conceptually these elements make it seemingly tougher to grow earnings in 2017 especially at a time when base of buybacks are moderating at sub 1 billion for the last four quarters and gross margins continue to compress, so maybe you can help us taking through at a high level maybe some puts and takes and what potentially will be positive drivers are offsetting some of these headwinds in 2017?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Wamsi, and again the multi-part clarification with the question is an interesting approach, but – so first on the revenue quarter to quarter, yes, so when we look at our third to fourth as I said, we typically get about $2.5 billion in transactional revenue in the quarter and that's sort of build in one-off, I mean, we got a different – we have a lot of different scenarios on what the year might look like, but that is certainly the predominant if you will scenario on how the fourth comes in.
On the view of 2017 which I'll come back to you in moment, again, I know you – and you said it I think, you did listen to my answer on IP, but this is not a onetime thing, right again, IBM has had as much as $1.07 billion of IP in our income statement, it is one of ways we monetize all of our intellectual property, it’s only one, right, we also obviously sell a lot too, but we license their IP is part of our business model. I don't think about it is one-time. We're going to continue to drive this and hopefully grow it. We've got a reasonable pull in the fourth of clients and partners who want to license our technology, so you shouldn't think of it is one-time at all.
Now, as we go into 2017, with our big transactional quarter coming up obviously and 90 days we'll talk about what we saw in the environment and what that position us for 2017, but I do think we know, we know a few things as we head into next year already today, so we know for instance we've got good momentum in our strategic imperatives and we continue to see with our investments and our view of the market, how that resonates with clients and I think we would expect to continue to see good strategic imperatives performance which also by the way will drive some investments but keep in mind that with everything we got done this year, the bulk of the spending, the bulk of the investment dollars we freed up next year, that's a much bigger number next year, so we have a freedom and an ability to invest more heavily given what we've got and done so far this year. So that's one thing we know.
Secondly, we're seeing good sign ins and backlog performance in our GTS business, that was sign-ins and backlog up again and within that GTS business, the biggest part of that our infrastructure services business which drives by the way that backlog also expanded margins in the quarter, so that's a big deal for us obviously. We also saw expanding margins in our – in parts of our GBS business and our application management business, again as we drive productivity. So, we know again good performance and momentum in strategic imperatives.
We have good sign-ins and backlog growth in our GTS business with margin expansion in some of services businesses. And then at this point we'll see where currency winds up in the next 75 days. At this point, it’s kind of neutral shift you will, it certainly not the billion plus impact we took this year as we wrapped on all the hedging from last year, so its far more neutral next year. Now, at the same time as you said we don't another tax case that we're going to close next year, but at the same time most of that was reinvested if you will or consumes elsewhere, it didn't show up on the bottom line.
So, yet too soon to tell, we'll get through the fourth, we'll talk about the 90 days when we see, but there is some -- there's momentum here in parts of this business that we'll be spending more time on.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Wamsi. Can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.
David Grossman
Thank you. So, Martin, if we look at organic growth rate of the imperatives, it looks like that began decelerating in the fourth quarter of last year and through the second quarter of this year. And then they looks at least, if my math right, they bounce back this quarter, and you did a good job of telegraphing that last year's growth was not sustainable. That said, the number are seems to be a little bit more volatile than expected. Is there any way you can help us parse this disclosure and just help us better understand what drove the deceleration and then what drove the subsequent rebound this quarter?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. I think the best thing to do, David, is to look at all of this on a trailing 12 months basis. You know, we recently started giving this on a quarterly basis. It’s a good disclosure and the sense that everyone ask for it and we try to provide the components of our strategic imperatives within each of our new segments. And I think in general people appreciated having that level of detail, but to your point, if you're looking for my advice and how best to interpret this I had interpreted on a 12 months trailing basis.
Our clients aren't making big, big investment decisions like who do I trust with my data and what cloud am I going to move on to? That's a decision that is going to last much longer than say, a 90 day reporting cycle. So, in any given reporting cycle there will be volatility. My advice look at it on a trailing 12 months basis and you can see the trend.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO. Your line is open.
Keith Bachman
Hi. Thank you very much. I also want to ask about cognitive solutions, you mentioned that the rollout of SAS if you will or software service is impacting the margins, yet you had still a very small part of the total, it's perhaps 100% of the current revenue base. As that ramp what that continue to place pressure on your margin structure? Or to say it different way, could you characterize that we look at 2017 would margins and cognitive solutions be at a minimum flattish. How are you thinking about that? And one clarification also just, did you mentioned what the total revenues in organic sources were or was M&A about two points I hope this quarter as well?
Martin Schroeter
Yes. So in total Keith, our acquisitions contributed about two points a growth, same as second quarter.
Keith Bachman
Okay. Yes.
Martin Schroeter
So, on our cognitive solutions and our margins, so first keep in mind, this is our highest margin business, it is primarily software and within that it's got very heavy high value content in the on-premise category if you will, right. And so these margins which are very high, we want to and we're moving some of this business and investing in the as-a-service, so as that moves into the margin profile, the cognitive solutions could it see a little bit of margin pressure over the long term. Yes, but it’s coming from a very, very high base.
And as-a-service component that's going in, it still better margin than all of the other segments in general. So, yes, the as-a-service component of cognitive solutions may have a bit of an impact just on that segment but overall it will still help IBM and again this is a very, very high margin segment at north of 80% here so. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Keith. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from James [Indiscernible] with SPE [ph]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you very much. And Martin thanks for the explanation about the additional investments you're doing that impacts gross margin. Can you help us understand incrementally going forward, so not say, year-over-year but kind of incrementally going forward, the efforts you been doing kind of this year. Should we expect the same type or incrementally do you feel like you're going to have to incrementally do more investments forward or just kind of at this level? Thank you very much.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Jim. I'd say that given, yes, we'll continue to invest. Do I think the rate of growth of investment has to continue? Well, the short answer is it may, but again remember how much we got done this year in terms of making room in the overall IBM equation and the productivity we are driving in parts of our services businesses, I know that we are seeing margin expansion in some of those.
So yes, we will continue to invest and infact I think that some of these markets require this level or the markets require this level of investment in order to be at the leading edge with our clients, but we do make a lot more room if you will in the overall IBM equation given everything we got done this year. And we’ll spend more time in 90 days on how all of that plays out for 2017, but again we made a lot of room for investments for ourselves for next year.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you. Can we please take one last question?
Operator
Thank you. And our last question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks. [Indiscernible] I’ll keep to one clarification and one question up. I guess you know the question really is when I look at your free cash flow usage over the last four quarters; it’s been you know more skewed towards acquisition versus what one would have thought in the past. As you look at 2017, do you think it optimizes more i.e. buybacks to be much more than you know the $1billion run rate you guys are running at and acquisitions could be small, just help us on this on the mix as you go forward. And then just to clarify when you talk about 90% to 100% conversion of net income to free cash flow in 2017 is that of a GAAP or non-GAAP number?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, sure I’ll do the clarification first Amit. So that’s our GAAP net income realization. We’ve just kept it consistent in terms of GAAP net income. It was the most straightforward for we think for everyone to understand. So the free cash flow realization data is GAAP net income.
On how free cash flow, skews next year and the application of our capital, I’d say first you know you can be assured that we are going to put all of our money to work as we have. We don’t tend to -- we don’t keep capital here to the extent its excess, after we’ve invested in organically and after we’ve purchased what we think we need through acquisitions and after we’ve paid the dividend we do return capital to shareholders.
Over the long term in the form of share repurchase, we over the long term as we said now pretty consistently, we think over the long term we can reduce our share count by 2% to 3% and that obviously recognizes that we will continue to be acquisitive. So, I would say that Amit what -- again we’ll talk more about what we have assumed when we get to 2017 but we will absolutely continue to invest organically, we’ll absolutely continue to be acquisitive. We’ll absolutely continue to grow the dividend and then to the extent that we have access capital to return we will return it on over the long term that number from a share repurchase would be a 2% to 3% reduction.
So, let me conclude, let me conclude by reminding you that we are running a highly differentiated play here. We are building obviously cognitive capabilities well beyond what others are doing with individual AI services if you will and we are building the platforms to help deliver that and we are making all of that available on another platform, the IBM cloud.
And it came up as you heard on the call, will Watson run on someone else’s cloud? No, it won’t, it will run on the IBM cloud. And we are doing all of that with deep industry expertise and that’s what our clients are looking for, that cognitive capability on the IBM cloud with deep industry expertise and you can see that in our health, you can see that in our IoT and you can see now in financial services which we just announced a couple of weeks ago.
So we are very excited about what we are doing and we are very excited about the businesses we are building and of course we are very excited with the help and what are allowing and enabling our clients to become which is cognitive businesses. So as we do that, we’ll continue to be deeply embedded in the fabric of how they run their businesses and the most important work they do. They trust us with their data, they trust us to be their partner and becoming cognitive businesses and quite frankly that’s how we make sure that we are successful over the long term. So thank you for joining our call today.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. In the second quarter, we generated $20.2 billion in revenue, $3.5 billion in pre-tax income and $2.95 of operating earnings per share.
Ninety days ago, we told you what we expected for the second quarter. We said we’d continue to see strength in the strategic imperatives and we delivered 12% revenue growth led by cloud. We said we’d continue to build as-a-service capabilities. Our cloud-as-a-service revenue was up 50% and we exited the quarter with an annual run rate of $6.7 billion in our cloud-as-a-service businesses. That’s up from $5.4 billion last quarter. Certainly we have a benefit from the acquisitions recently closed but we has solid organic growth as well.
We said we’d continue a high level of investment as we move into new areas and build new markets, and we did that both organically and through acquisitions. And we said that, given seasonality and actions we took in the first quarter, we’d grow our pre-tax income by about $2 billion quarter to quarter, and we grew a bit more than that. In total, we got done what we set out to do and we saw some improvements in trajectory relative to long-term trends, though, as always, the rate and pace varied by business unit and geography.
Let me touch quickly on some of the drivers for the quarter. As I said, we continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our strategic imperatives. Over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered $31 billion in revenue, and now represent 38% of IBM. Growth was led by cloud, where our revenue was up 30% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, and over $11.5 billion over the last year so good progress in cloud. Looking at revenue from a segment perspective, the strongest growth came from cognitive solutions led by our analytics and cognitive capabilities and security.
In technology services and cloud platforms, our infrastructure services revenue continues to grow while integration software declined as we shift those offerings to cloud. And our GTS backlog grew on the back of strong signings. Our systems business again reflects the product cycle dynamics in terms of revenue and margin. And Global Business Services continues to reflect a shift in our business. We’re continuing to deliver double-digit growth in the strategic areas led by mobile and cloud and our application management business is stable though pressure in the more traditional areas of consulting and some inconsistency in our execution continue to impact the GBS results.
As we shift IBM’s business overall, it’s important to understand that we’re not only moving them to new spaces but in fact creating entirely new markets. So as I said, we’re investing at a high level both by growing organic investment in areas like our Watson platform capabilities and our cloud data center capacity and getting acquisitions into our run rate. Our investments together with currency, product cycle dynamics, and the actions we took in the first quarter are reflected in our profit performance in the first half of this year. I’ll talk about how the second half plays out relative to the first later in the call as we continue to expect to deliver at least 13.50 of operating earnings per share for the year.
Let me spend a minute on what we’ve got done as we move into new areas and become a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. Clients are looking to become digital businesses and our cognitive solutions bring together digital business with digital intelligence to improve decision-making and add intelligence into all products and processes. For example, companies such as Kimberly-Clark, the ISS group, and sesame workshop announced in the second quarter they are working with IBM on innovative Internet of Things solutions for everything from facilities management to early childhood education.
Healthcare organizations such as the U.K.’s National Health Service, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the American Diabetes Association were among many in the quarter that announced they are leveraging Watson to create new approaches to treatment and patient care. And in the second quarter, we announced Watson for cyber security, a new cloud based version of our cognitive technology trained on the language of security. What these innovative client initiatives have in common is that they are industry-based cognitive solutions enabled by the IBM cloud and all of this is supporting the movement of our clients to hybrid environments.
This quarter, we extended our cloud innovations available on Bluemix including the first Apache Spark development environment for data scientists to more quickly and easily analyze big data. We delivered new IoT services using Bluemix OpenWhisk, our event driven programming model to speed development of IoT applications on the IBM cloud. We announced block chain agreements with banks such as Mizuho and Crédit Mutuel Arkéa and we opened a Bluemix garage in New York City to help financial services clients rapidly design, build, and pilot their own block chain solutions as well as other emerging fintech applications and services.
We leveraged recent acquisitions in Clearleap, Cleversafe and Ustream to announce new Video-on-Demand services deals with major brands such as Mazda, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Comic-Con. We also continue to partner with major IT industry players, leveraging IBM’s unique hybrid platform to grow and extend their own offerings and client migrations. For example, we announced that IBM cloud would be a strategic partner of Box Zones in Europe and Asia. Box Zones and the IBM cloud will uniquely enable clients to store and manage data across hybrid environments in the country of their choice and we expanded our global partnership with VMware to deliver desktop services in a security-rich environment on the IBM cloud.
We also announced a breakthrough in making quantum computing available on the IBM cloud. The IBM Quantum Experience is a great example of how cloud is making emerging technologies available that wouldn’t have been accessible in the past. This kind of open innovation will allow for the next stage of development in quantum information technology and help push a universal quantum computer to reality even faster. Now Quantum isn’t a new idea. Researchers have been working on it for a long time. But it’s a not niche either. On the day we announced it, it generated 138 million Twitter impressions and to give you a sense of that level of interest, it’s fewer than Andy Murray when he won Wimbledon. But it’s more than the impressions generated by Phil Mickelson’s record tying score in the first round of the Open last Thursday.
Since the launch in May, we already have active users in nearly 150 countries that have run more than 175,000 experiments through the IBM Quantum Experience. As we move into new areas, we’re also continuing to deliver innovation in the core. For example, in Infrastructure Services, we’re shifting from being a systems integrator to a services integrator, connecting and streamlining multiple environments and delivering as-a-service solutions to our clients. You see this in our recent engagements with Pratt & Whitney and Emirates.
To help systems innovation, this quarter we acquired EZSource to help developers quickly and easily update mainframe applications. And in software we entered into an agreement with a strategic partner to license the intellectual property of some of our assets within our core software portfolio to accelerate product innovation and extend the capabilities to hybrid cloud. I’ll expand on some of these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions. But first let me walk through our financial metrics for the quarter.
Our revenue for the quarter was $20.2 billion. While there was a lot of movement in individual currencies in total, currency translation had a 20 basis point impact to revenue growth. I’ll talk to our performance at constant currency. Our revenue is down 2.5%, and on a geographic basis Americas was down 2%. This was an improvement from last quarter’s rate across the U.S., Canada and Latin America. Europe was weaker, due primarily to Germany and Switzerland. And Asia Pacific was down about 2%. And with strong growth in India once again, and sequential improvement in all of the BRIC countries, the BRIC’s returned to growth. Our gross margin performance reflects higher levels of investment, especially in cognitive solutions and the fact that we’re building scale in our as-a-service businesses.
Looking at expense on a year-to-year basis, there are a few items to note. First is an increase in investment levels. We also have a higher level of IP income this quarter due primarily to the licensing partnership I just mentioned. And while not an impact to this year, we did have work force rebalancing charges last year as well as some gains that mitigated those charges. And finally, we have a year-to-year impact from currency as last year’s hedging gains roll off. In fact, at a PTI level, when you consider both the hedge and the translation impact, currency impacted profit growth by about $250 million.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 19% all in, at the higher end of the range we provided at the beginning of the year, which you will remember was 18% plus or minus a couple of points without discrete items. From a cash perspective we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and more than $13 billion over the last 12 months. This is over 100% of our GAAP net income, and over the same period we returned about 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and gross share purchases.
As we get into the segments, remember our strategy and point of view is that to be successful you need to bring together cognitive solutions to improve decision-making and outcomes, to approach that with an industry context and skills, and to enable that in a hybrid environment to get the agility of the cloud while leveraging the breadth of an enterprise data and processes. Now I’ll talk about how each of our segments plays a critical role in how we capture these opportunities.
Starting with our Cognitive Solutions segment where revenue growth accelerated to 4% in the second quarter. We had sequential improvement in both solutions software and transaction processing software. Our solutions software revenue was up 6% for the quarter. Our strong performance in SAS continued with double-digit growth in revenue. Growth was led by analytics and security, and acquisitions clearly provided lift.
Our Analytics business is the largest portion of the solutions software portfolio. Analytics grew in key areas including Cognos, information integration and big data, and of course Watson as we add to our capabilities. The Weather Company acquisition is off to a good start as we integrate it with Watson Technology.
In June, we introduced Watson Adds [ph], leveraging the weather platform, which delivers as many as 26 billion forecasts daily. Consumers will be able to interact with IBM Watson through advertising, by asking questions and receiving relevant product information. Campbell, Unilever and GSK Consumer Healthcare will be the first marketers to collaborate with The Weather Company on Watson Adds [ph].
Security had strong revenue growth and together with our Security Services we outpaced the market by 3X. Our momentum is driven by our unique market position. We have built an extensive security portfolio tailored to the needs of our clients for integrated security across their entire operations. As a result, we’re the number one enterprise security software and services provider and hold a leadership position in 12 of the 14 segments according to Forrester, IDC and Gartner.
This quarter we closed our Resilient acquisition, adding leading incident response technology and expertise to our portfolio. We had strong demand for our Guardian offerings as we saw clients moving to our database security offerings across a range of industries including Information Services and banking. And in May we announced Watson for cyber security, a new cognitive system we have been training and will make available in a beta program later this year for use by our customers. As part of this announcement, eight leading universities will also train Watson in the language of security.
We’re growing and broadening the reach of Watson with new capabilities, partnerships, and engagements to accelerate adoption. Clients across industries are expanding their Watson engagements, moving from pilot use cases in consulting engagements into long-term production. As an example, in the second quarter, design software leader Autodesk signed a multi-year production SAS agreement with Watson to leverage Watson Engagement Advisor. This engagement builds on the value and strong usage proven during the pilot to resolve customer inquiries. This is one demonstration of our focus on the core conversational service for client applications and the developer community.
We also introduced new offerings such as Watson Company Analyzer, which helps companies reduce the time and effort required to collect, digest, and synthesize information for building strategic business relationships and understanding competitive market spaces. And in Watson Health, we continue to capitalize on our differentiated ability to understand, reason, and learn with industry specialization.
We launched Watson Care Manager, which provides structured programs and tools to support care coordinators in delivering care to patients. This offering enables patients to avoid rehospitalization. In the second quarter, we extended partnerships with the American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association, which are examples of the strong support and momentum Watson Health has with leading clinical and research communities. And at the White House Cancer Moon Shot Summit, we made a commitment to utilize our cognitive solutions to help doctors offer personalized care to 10,000 veterans fighting cancer.
We’re working with Teva, a large pharmaceuticals client to improve drug efficacy for millions of patients with complex and chronic diseases by leveraging the IBM Watson Health cloud solution. We formed a medical imaging collaborative with 15 industry leaders to put Watson to work extracting insights from invisible unstructured imaging data. And in April, we closed the Truven acquisition. The data and insights from Truven will be integrated into our Watson Health cloud.
So now looking at the profit results for the segment. Gross margin was down largely driven by mix shift to SAS and higher investments including acquisition content. Pre-tax income performance continues to reflect our higher level of investment and strategic growth areas like Watson platform, Health, and IoT again this quarter. Global Business Services delivered $4.3 billion of revenue. Our performance was similar to recent quarters with continued growth in our strategic imperatives, offset by declines in the more traditional consulting areas.
We saw double digit growth in our digital practices around cloud, analytics, mobility, security, and cognitive. And we continue to aggressively shift resources and investments to drive these businesses.
Our GBS team leads the industry mission for IBM as we have amassed over 100,000 industry resources. Our consultants build strategies that help our clients gain new insights on data and launch new business models for competitive advantage. We’re scaling the industry’s first cognitive consulting practice which draws on the expertise of more than 2,000 consulting professionals spanning machine learning, advanced analytics, data science, and development.
We continue to ramp the IBM interactive experience. We have opened over 30 digital studios around the globe including new studios in Singapore and Seoul. We also completed the acquisition of Aperto, a digital agency in Berlin with over 300 employees and a roster of enterprise clients such as Airbus and Siemens. We’re shifting away from traditional on premise ERP to cloud-based application management and consulting. We closed on the acquisition of Bluewolf this quarter, a top sales force partner and recognized leader in cloud consulting and implementation services.
We’re also growing our services on workday applications, leveraging the skills we brought on through our Meteorix acquisition last year. Overall, we delivered 60% growth in our cloud practice this quarter. Application Management remains stable as clients look to us to manage the lifecycle of their applications, and bring new applications to market faster through digital cloud platforms.
Turning to profit. GBS gross profit and PTI margins were down year-to-year. These margin declines reflect the investments we’re making in our digital practices as well as some issues in our execution. And in some of the traditional service areas that are not as differentiated, we’re seeing price and profit pressure. We continue to invest and shift resources to our higher value services around digital and cognitive.
We’re also taking actions to improve our delivery efficiency and execution while remaining focused on our commitment to our clients’ success.
Technology services and cloud platforms delivered nearly $9 billion of revenue with growth in infrastructure services offset by declines in technical support services and integration software. Across the segment, our strategic imperatives were also up strong double digits. We had strong signings performance in GTS and the backlog for the segment continued to grow.
We saw continued momentum in infrastructure services as clients turned to us to optimize their IT environments and move them to cloud. We again had strong growth in the IBM cloud. Our point of view is that clients can unlock the most value for their businesses by moving to hybrid cloud infrastructures which provide agility and enable new business models while at the same time tie back to their core systems of record. We always said that hybrid capabilities are critical for an enterprise grade cloud and we continue to lead in a rapidly growing hybrid cloud market. We’re shifting from systems integration to services integration as we connect multiple environments and build out hybrid infrastructures, delivered as a service to the client.
Our as-a-service revenue for the segment was up over 50% for the quarter. We continue to sign transformative agreements with clients to optimize their infrastructure and help digitize their operations. At Pratt & Whitney, we’ll move their business, manufacturing, and engineering enterprise systems to a fully managed environment on the IBM cloud. They’re expecting to double their engine production by 2020 and we’ll provide them with the means to manage, analyze, and grow their infrastructure dramatically to accommodate the company’s growth.
And this quarter, we signed a seven-year $1.3 billion agreement with CSC to expand our cloud partnership and build a secure scaleable and flexible mainframe infrastructure that will enable CSC to economically scale up and down demand to address current and future client needs and reduce its capital outlays. This builds on announcement earlier this year that integrated Bluemix into their cloud management platform. Bluemix provides our clients with speed and agility in launching new business models and applications in the cloud. And along with the rest of the integration software portfolio, it’s at the heart of our hybrid cloud strategy. Overall, integration software revenue declined.
From a product perspective we had continued strength in our connect products as clients integrate applications, data, and processes for both on-prem and cloud-based acquisitions. Across integration software, our annuity content is growing and we accelerate the shift to an as-of-service consumption model through new cloud capabilities delivered on our Bluemix cloud platform. For example, this year Kaiser Permanente began its move to the IBM cloud and Bluemix as the strategic platform for their transformation to a more agile data driven organization engaging with millions of individual members and patients. This will allow them to take advantage of new technologies, existing data and back end systems in a hybrid model.
Turning to profit, our gross profit was down year-to-year driven by the mix of businesses within the segment. Our PTI margin also reflects this business mix impact as well as the investments we’re making to build out our cloud platforms. Additionally, this quarter we entered into an agreement with one of our strategic business partners where we will license the intellectual property of select assets within the integration software portfolio while jointly going to market to ensure our clients’ success. This will shift our spending profile for these assets to a more variable cost structure anything forward.
Systems revenue was down consistent with the cycle. Our systems hardware revenue was down 28%. Operating system software revenue was down 4% this quarter, which is a modest sequential improvement in year-to-year performance but as we said, we expect operating systems to continue to be a drag on growth. Revenues for our z Systems declined 40% in the second quarter while margins improved, consistent with where we are in the product cycle. We’re continuing to expand the z client base adding 13 new clients in the quarter and nearly 70 since the beginning of the cycle. We had had our first major z13 win in China this quarter with a large Chinese bank migrating its mainframe install base to our latest technology. We’re continuing to drive innovation in the z Systems platform. 
As I mentioned earlier, we acquired EZSource, which will help our clients modify applications for their digital transformation while also supporting agility and hybrid cloud. Our revenue was down in the second quarter with growth in the mid-range offset by declines in the high and the low end. The UNIX market is a high value space that’s been declining and we represent the majority of the market. Our performance here reflects the replacement dynamic, following strong performance in the high end of POWER8 in the second quarter of last year. While the midrange has been growing year-to-year, we will see a similar replacement dynamic in the third quarter as we ramp on the midrange POWER8 introduction.
We’re also addressing the growing Linux market, and this quarter we grew year to year and quarter to quarter with our Linux on Power strategy. It is becoming a more meaningful part of our business with over 10% of our POWER revenue in the second quarter. We have seen particular success with Hanna [ph], a play that we started a year ago. We will expand the Linux-only portfolio by leveraging OpenPOWER, we plan to bring two new servers supporting cloud-enabled big data and cognitive applications to our portfolio and release our second generation HPC [ph] server with POWER8 processors connected to an Nvidia GPU acceleration.
Turning to Storage, as we said in the past, storage value is shifting to software, which is reported in our Cognitive Solutions segment. In Storage Software, we’re continuing to grow software-defined storage, which includes object storage and our newly introduced Spectrum suite offerings. Storage hardware revenue decreased 13%, which continues to reflect weakness in the traditional disc storage market. We released the new all flash DSAK [ph] storage offering during the second quarter, giving us competitive differentiation with plans to deliver all flash offerings across the entire portfolio.
Our Systems gross profit and pre-tax income declined, reflecting the revenue performance. Our Systems gross profit margin was flat with margin improvements in both z Systems and POWER, offset by lower storage margins and the impact of mix.
So now after going through the segments, I want to address the performance of software across our segments. Our total software revenue was up 1%, driven by an acceleration in the annuity content. Subscription and support revenue was up reflecting increased deployment by our clients and steady renewal rates. And the investments in new areas are paying off with growth in SAS. Acquisitions contributed to that growth, and we also grew our annuity base on an organic basis. I will remind you that while the SAS acquisitions add to the top line, they’re a drag to profit in the first year.
Looking at the annuity growth by business area, we had strong growth in cognitive solutions as well as integration software, while the annuity content in operating systems declined.
Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet, we generated $3.1 billion of cash from operations excluding our financing receivables. After a billion investment in CapEx, we generated $2.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. For the first half, free cash flow of nearly $4.5 billion is essentially flat year to year, with lower cash taxes offsetting the year-to-year operational performance. These first half results support our expectation that we will deliver the high end of the full-year free cash flow guidance range we provided earlier this year. This takes into account the cash payments related to the work force rebalancing charge taken earlier in the year as well as the timing of tax payments in the second half.
Looking at the uses of cash in the first half, we have invested $5.4 billion in acquisitions. So far this year, we have acquired 11 businesses, including Truven Health Analytics and the digital assets of The Weather Company. In the last six months we have returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, including $2.6 billion in dividends. In April, we again raised our dividend, and with that we’ve now doubled our dividend per share since 2010. In the first half, we bought back over 12 million shares and we ended June with 956 million shares outstanding and 3.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Moving to the balance sheet, we ended June with $10.6 billion in cash. Our total debt was about $44.5 billion of which $26.5 billion was in support of our Financing business. The leverage in our Financing business remains at seven-to-one, and the portfolio remains strong at 52% investment grade. You can see more on this topic in our supplemental material in the backup.
Our non-financing debt was 18 billion, and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 59%. The increase in both reflect the timing of our debt issuances relative to maturities this year. Our balance sheet continues to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long-term.
So now let me wrap up and talk about our view of the second half and put it in context of the first half performance. We thought we’d lay it out on a slide for you. You’ll recall in the first quarter we took significant actions to transform our workforce and change the way we work, resulting in significant workforce rebalancing and real estate charges. As we said, this is about rebalancing skills more than capacity reduction, and so these actions free up spend that can be reinvested to build capabilities as well as contributing to the bottom line. We’ve started to see some savings already, but the majority of the growth savings we’ll see in 2016 will come in the fourth quarter. We mapped all of that out in our last call, and we’re right on track.
As expected, our mainframe product cycle also had an impact to our EPS growth in the first half. As we enter the second half, our mainframe compares will get easier. In fact, we expect mainframe to be fairly neutral to EPS growth. Over the last 12 months, we have been investing at a high level both organically and through acquisitions, as we build cognitive and cloud capabilities. The organic investments had a mid-single digit impact on our EPS growth. As we wrap on the higher level of spend in the back half of last year, this will have less of an impact on EPS growth over the next two quarters.
We’ve completed 20 acquisitions over the last year. The acquired content is contributing to our top line and will continue to do so in the second half because these are primarily as-a-service capabilities and require additional investment as we create new spaces, they have a return profile with a longer payback. The acquisitions we’ve completed to date had a low-single digit impact to our EPS growth rate in the first half. They’ll continue to be dilutive in the second half, though at a lower level. Many of these new capabilities are delivered as a service. As these ramp, it’ll benefit our second half relative to the first, not only from a software mix perspective, but adding scale will also help our margins.
And of course, we’ve talked about the impact of currency on our profit growth in 2016, due primarily to the roll-off of last year’s hedging gains. We can’t predict where currently will go from here, but at current spot rates the impact from currency will moderate in the second half due to year-to-year hedging dynamics and a slightly better translational environment. And finally, you’ll recall we had a significant discrete tax benefit in the first quarter. Relative to the ongoing effective tax rate, we continue to expect to be in the range we provided at the beginning of the year. Put it all together, and we expect our second half EPS dynamics to be significantly improved over the first and continue to expect to deliver at least $13.50 of operating EPS for the year.
So with that financial context to our second half from a business perspective, we’ll continue to focus on using cognitive to help clients get value from their data, to improve decision-making and outcomes, moving our clients to hybrid cloud environments and with a strong industry dimension. As we do that, we’re moving into new spaces and, in some cases, creating entirely new markets. We’ll continue to shift our business toward our strategic imperatives, with strong growth in our as-a-service offerings and continued growth in software. And we’ll continue to invest to add capabilities and to deliver innovation across the business, all while returning value to shareholders.
And so with that, we’ll take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty
Thanks. Good afternoon. You didn’t mention the UK in your commentary around EMEA. How did the headlines around Brexit impact the month of June? And did it have any impact on not raising the full-year outlook despite beats in the first and second quarter? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Katie. Thank you. So we certainly – I don’t think that Brexit coming at the end of the quarter helped us at all, but we obviously finished kind of right where we expected to finish. And when we look at our full view of the year, we don’t see an impact, if you will, that has any real materiality on us. And that’s why we continue to hold our operating EPS. So it certainly didn’t help but, again, no – nothing that said we should change our operating EPS for the year. What I typically observe in these kinds of instances is that our discussions with our clients have to go through a process of reprioritization, if you will. And remember, the extent of the discussions we have with our clients is about their most important processes.
So as they reprioritize, the length of time that takes depends a lot on how much uncertainty they’re faced with. And obviously, the political leadership in Europe and the UK can help reduce that uncertainty, but we didn’t see – again, we don’t think it helped but it didn’t cause us to change our guidance.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katie. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes. Thank you. Martin, I estimate that software acquisitions helped about $350 million to $400 million in terms of the revenue impact year-over-year. And if that’s the case, then company revenues declined about 4% or a bit more and software revenues declined about 5% or a bit more. I was hoping you could clarify if those numbers are correct, because if they are, it actually suggests that both company revenue and software revenue decelerated from Q1 even though the compare was actually a bit easier. So I was wondering if you could address this notion of what appeared to be some deceleration in the business on an organic basis.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Tony. A couple of things. First, the acquisitions are part of IBM, so when you say company revenue, I think of the total as kind of company revenue. Within the total, as we’ve talked about, we did at Investor Day and I think this is generally true, given the volume of acquisitions we do, we generally over the long term see about a point help. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we got about twice that. We got about two points of help in total. Now, that’s not all software obviously. Also as you know, we’ve been acquiring some businesses for our GBS business. So on an acquisitive impact across IBM, it was about two points.
What we saw in software in the second quarter, I would describe the dynamic as very similar to what we’ve seen over the past few quarters, which is we – in our largest clients, we see continued deployment, and therefore we continue to grow the annuity base in those large clients. And outside those large clients we continue to see growth in total. And then, again, the transactional business, which tends to have an out-sized impact in the second and the fourth quarter because of our mix of revenue – of transactional versus annuity also plays into this when you start looking at it sequentially because they’re not fully comparable, if you will. The mix is a bit different. So acquisitions clearly a benefit to us. About two points, as I said, in total, a mix of software and services. And a set of software dynamics underneath that that suggest to us continued deployment, continued growth in the annuity base, and still some transactional growth pressure, if you will, in some of our largest clients.
A – Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tony. Rowena [ph], can we please take the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMC. You may ask your question.
Tien-tsin Huang
Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just on the services side, I saw that signings were up nicely. Anything unusual there? And can we see an eventual pull-through there with consulting maybe following behind it? And, Martin, you did mention some inconsistency on execution I think a couple times. Can you elaborate on that? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Tien-tsin. Thanks. So we did have pretty good signings, and that signings kept the backlog in total flat year to year. What we’re seeing in the marketplace, if I start to disaggregate between GTS and GBS for a moment, we continue to see very strong growth in GTS. You saw that in the signings numbers and you see that in the growing backlog. And that profile, if you will, of what we’re working on for our clients is very consistent with what we’ve talked about in the past, which is our clients are looking to move to hybrid clouds. Our clients are looking for us to help them develop and deploy and run some of the latest technologies such as mobile. So that trend continues. The size of those deals continues to be quite substantial. Not every deal is a big deal, but we haven’t seen any reduction certainly in deal sizes. In fact, we’ve had some of the biggest deals – some of the volume of biggest deals that we’ve seen over the past few years continue in the GTS business.
And when we look forward at that GTS relationship, if you will, in over the last, call it, 10 quarters, over two and a half years or so, we’ve had pretty good consistent book-to-bill greater than one. So the booking rates, as you know, are the signings we report. And then on the billing side, in GPS you have our maintenance business as well. And so obviously that doesn’t go into the bookings side of the equation. So you’ve got to do the math right but book-to-bill in GTS has been over the last 10 quarters very consistent. Again, reflects, I think, the strong value we bring to clients.
On the consulting side in GBS, we did have a good signings quarter. There is plenty of business out there and we see good uptake of our most advanced offerings, if you will, those that help digitize our clients. We continue to pull back on that enterprise kind of wide application installation. When we say pull back, by the way, that means we’re moving resource and we moved again more than a third of our resource out of that part of the business. So it’s not a surprise that that part of the business is declining. So the consulting opportunity is certainly there. When we talk about execution, when I talk about execution issues, I guess the way I’d say it is, look, we – we take on our industry skills, take on some pretty complex projects for our clients, and sometimes we have to spend a bit more money than we would have thought in order to make it all working properly and making sure our clients are satisfied. So that’s on us. That’s on execution. The teams, you know, they’ll work through these things but I wouldn’t call it – I wouldn’t call it widespread.
A – Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tien-tsin. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Apelo [ph] with JMP Securities. You may ask your question.
Q – Unidentified Analyst
Great. Thank you very much. Martin, one quick question I wanted to ask about the EPS trajectory in the second half. And I know you reiterated at least 13.50 in EPS. But in light of the macro headlines, I was wondering if you’re thinking about weighing Q3 and Q4 any differently in the second half of the year. Thanks.
A – Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Greg. Sure. So we included a pretty detailed chart, I think, on some of the first half to second half trajectory changes. And I think the one point to make kind of across the board on that chart is that everything there, it gets either the same or better in the fourth. And so when we look at all of the impacts as an example, you know, we’ve got the chart that shows as-a-service scale helping and a chart that shows the actions we took in the first quarter helping in the second quarter. All of those have a bigger impact in the fourth than they do in the third. And the rest do as well, but those are just, again, two examples.
So I guess the way I think about third versus fourth in a total perspective, you know, in total third quarter for us tends to be in a fairly tight range. You know, our annuity business plays a bigger role in our overall revenue streams than our transactional business does in the third. So in that EPS range in the third, we have typically been kind of 22% to 24% of the full year. And, you know, when we look at that with the momentum we have on the things that are on that chart, I’d say that we’re more in the middle to the high end of that range in the third and then, you know, the rest obviously in the fourth. So while, you know, those statistics are good indicators in total when we’re going through a transformation like this, you know, at the margin again in the third, we’d say kind of mid to high end of the historical range for third quarter EPS.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Greg. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.
Joseph Foresi
Hi. I wanted to build on the margin question. I was wondering how should we think about the impact of the margin profile, the strategic imperatives through the transformation over the long term? Do you think we’re through the heavy CapEx there and, you know, will the exit of this year and the margin profile there be a good proxy for 2017? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Joe. A couple of things on margins. First, we have talked a bit about what drives margin in the IBM financial model at length, and as you’ll remember, we talked about mix of our business. We’ve talked about productivity in our services business. We’ve talked about portfolio actions. And then this year we started talking about kind of as-a-service based on scale and you can see three of those four elements in our more detailed list of what changes first half to second half. The ones that’s not there obviously is portfolio actions because we don’t have any, you know, we don’t have any big divestitures planned here that are going to drive portfolio. In fact, the way I’d say it is when we look at the portfolio, we think each of the elements can drive value for our clients, and we still see high value in the elements.
Part of the way we get comfortable with each of those elements driving value is when we look at the margins on the strategic imperative content relative to the rest, the margins on the strategic imperatives content has been and second quarter again higher than what we see on the core business. So I interpret that as, you know, the places we’re moving to, the places we’re building value for our clients looks like a pretty high value marketplace, and we’ll continue – it’s one that’s worth us continuing to serve. So we think, you know, we build on margin with three of those four components that we typically have from an as-of-service perspective I don’t think we’re through the capital requirements by any stretch. We’ll continue to shift our capital to the cloud business to make sure that we have got the right scale that we need for our model. So we’re not through it, but again I don’t think IBM is becoming more capital intensive overall. A lot of times it’s just a shift from one to another. And then obviously we’ll keep investing in the capital we need to drive our acquisitions as we integrate those as well.
A – Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Joe. Rowena, can we please take the next question?
Operator
Yes, ma’am. Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
StevenMilunovich
Great. Thank you. The strategic imperative revenue growth, I think it’s slowing. I think it was 17% year-over-year last quarter, 12% this quarter. Analytics is a big piece of that. I think that went from 9% to 5%. Could you talk about what kind of growth you see going forward as these numbers get bigger? And conversely what was the decline in the core franchise revenue? And what’s been the trend there the last few quarters? Thanks.
MartinSchroeter
Sure. Thanks, Steve. On the core, if you will, everything outside the strategic revenue – everything outside the strategic imperatives, that’s kind of been flattish. Right. It’s been flat quarter-to-quarter I should say. It’s down but it’s kind of flat quarter-to-quarter. So in change in trajectory on that part of the business.
In the strategic imperatives, you know, when we started talking about this a year and a half ago at our Investor Day, and we put on the table at the time that that business would grow to $40 billion or 40% of our revenue by, you know, at the end of 2018. We think, and we draw that plum line, we think we’re, you know, I’d say probably a little bit ahead of the track that we need to get there. We’re certainly ahead on the percentage mix because 38% of our business is already there, and we only got – we got 2.5 years to go from a timing perspective.
So we’re on track to the $40 billion because with $31 billion now trailing 12 months, we actually don’t even have to grow at this rate to get over the line. Now, you know, the acquisitions will play a role in this, and we see continued momentum here. But we don’t even have to grow at this rate in order to get where we set out to get a year and a half ago.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Steve. Can we please take the next question?
Operator
Yes. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian White with Drexel. You may ask your question.
Q – Brian White
Yeah. Martin, on the cloud business, so cloud it looks like grew 30% year-over-year. Has the cloud business reached the bottom in the margin profile and is on an upward trajectory? Or do we still have a little bit more of a decline? And if you can just put us – give us some type of an idea where are you in cloud margins versus where you hope to be optimally in, say, four or five years? Thank you.
A – Martin Schroeter
Sure, Brian. So two things. Remember, you know, our cloud business, we’re really – if I had to oversimplify it, we have – we have part of our business helping our clients build their own clouds. And that includes hardware, it includes software, it has some services as well. And when we do that with our clients, the margins we see in those businesses are exactly what we kind of see in the rest. That’s kind of the demand profile of where some of that business is going. The margins don’t look any different from that perspective. To the extent the mix is different between how much hardware and how much software and how much services go in, there may be a different margin on the solution. But as I mentioned in total, our strategic imperatives are mixing a bit richer and so we’re seeing better margins in total across the imperatives. So that’s the – that’s the kind of help our clients build their own cloud.
On the ads of service side of this, I think that as we put on the chart, you know, the ads of service component even though we’re going to continue to drive a fair bit of investment here, the as of service component will start to add – be accretive to our margins on a year-over-year basis starting in the second half already. Now, we’ll see where the marketplace goes and we’ll see where how much we rely on getting or keeping, if you will, that margin growth as opposed to reinvesting. But we see, again, on a big part of some of that cloud business, we see margins that are consistent with what we see in other parts, and the as of service business we start to see year-over-year accretion in the margins from that, even though again, we’ll continue to invest quite heavily.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Brian. Rowena, can we please take the next question.
Operator
Yes, ma’am. Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may ask our question.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. Martin, for overall IBM strategic imperatives grew 38% of revenues, but in GBS strategic imperatives is already over 50% of segment revenue. But yet overall GBS revenue was down 3%. So I think there’s a notion of people expecting aggregate IBM to eventually get to growth as you see strategic imperative mix increase over time, but I was wondering if you can comment more specifically with respect to GBS. What some of the offsets were on that revenue line? I think execution you were alluding to margins, but more specifically on the revenue line, which caused deceleration? What would imply strong deceleration in the core on GBS?
Martin Schroeter
Yeah. Thanks, Wamsi. And that’s right. We did see some pretty strong deceleration or declines in the core of that. And as I said, we’re continuing to shift our skills and our resources out of that part of the marketplace. So in a business which if you oversimplified it is really about how do – how do industry experts charge or bill for their time, your billing is going to be limited or constrained by how much resource you have applied to it. That won’t surprise you.
And then as I mentioned, we moved about 35% of our resource applied to those core parts of the business over into the strategic imperatives. So that has two effects: One, it obviously reduces the ability of us to grow revenue in those places when you constrain the resource; and, two, because the productivity is not a one-for-one, you know, someone who – someone who is billing on an implementation in an enterprise resource kind of an application doesn’t immediately become a cognitive expert or doesn’t immediately become a mobile expert. So there is a productivity impact, and what we give up, while we give up 100% let’s say of that billing capability, we don’t get 100% back right away. And that’s really what you’re seeing in our Consulting business.
In GBS outside of the Consulting, the Application Management, the Global Process Services businesses, they’re fairly stable within the overall GBS equation. But the Consulting business continues to go through this transition as we pull resources off and we put them into and devote the resource or the investments if you will to the strategic imperative areas.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Wamsi. Can we take the next question please?
Operator
Yes. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
James Schneider
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the GBS segment, it sounds given what you just said about the continued pricing headwinds that you’re seeing in the traditional ERP implementations, and maybe the execution issues, that that’s going to be persistent headwind even in the back half of the year. So can you maybe give us some kind of commentary around when you would expect at least the impact of the runoff of some of that more commodity-like business to start to let – not be a headwind anymore? And can you see kind of the end of the execution issues in terms of the cost of some of those implementations that might have been overrun?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Jim. So a couple of things. One, on when do we kind of work our way through this, one thing to look at here is the signings performance in the quarter, and GBS did grow signings in the quarter. Now, there is obviously a lag. It sits in the backlog. And as you saw in our total backlog is flat. I mentioned earlier that GPS [ph] was up in backlog, and obviously therefore the GBS component of that is down a little. So while we are growing signings, which are a pretty good leading indicator of the kind of business, and that’s a function of all the people we have moved into those new areas while we’ve pull back from the others, that total signings equation is now starting to work. We grew signings in total, right? So the new stuff is offsetting if you will the old stuff. But not enough yet to get the backlog back to growth. And we’ve got to get that backlog back to growth in order to have kind of turn the corner for that signings equation, which we got back to growth to get the revenue equation, if you will, back to growth.
A – Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Jim. Let’s take one last question.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. You may ask your question.
David Grossman
Thank you. So, Martin, there are several factors that are impacting the free cash flow conversion this year. Can you help us understand what known factors are out today? Headwinds or tailwinds that we should consider for conversion next year?
A – Martin Schroeter
Sure, David. Thanks. So as we said, we reiterated our view of free cash flow at the end of the first. We were comfortable at the time and remain comfortable to be at the high end of what we had originally provided. So within that, realization for us is a pretty good measure of how we’re converting our cash. Our model is to be in the 90s, and I think with kind of the headwinds, tailwinds we see within free cash flow for the year, I’d say we’re probably more likely to wind up in the high 90s in 2016. Now as we get into next year, you know, there’s a lot that we have to get through in order to understand what next year is going to look like. But I am comfortable that while, you know, we’ll finish again probably high 90s this year. I’m comfortable that our model is right even for next year that we’ll be in the 90s again next year when we look at all of the pieces.
Martin Schroeter
So let me conclude the call by reminding everyone that, you know, we’re running our clients’ most critical process, and that puts us into a pretty unique and terrific, quite frankly, position to move them to the future. And it’s not just about the infrastructure, which is obviously important. We’ve always felt that it’s important and we think it’s important today. But it’s also about helping them become digital businesses and helping them inject cognitive into everything they do. It’s what they’re asking for and it’s quite frankly been our perspective on where the world is going.
So we’re not only doing that with our existing clients and not only doing that in kind of a traditional IT, but in some cases we’re building entirely new businesses, and entirely new markets. And so that, you know, for many is beyond what some of you would focus on in terms of infrastructure, but it’s becoming a bigger and bigger part of what IBM is becoming, and again it’s our view of where value will be created for clients and for our investors. And so as we make those shifts and as we build these new markets, you know, we take – we take our temperature, if you will, at the end of June and we’d say we’re right on track with what we wanted to get done for the year. So with that, thanks for joining the call

Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you've any objections you may disconnect at this time.
Now, I will turn the meeting over to Miss Patricia Murphy. Ma'am, you may begin.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President Investor Relations for IBM. I'm here today with Martin Schroeter, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter earnings presentation.
The prepared remarks will be available within a couple of hours and a replay of the webcast will be posted by this time tomorrow.
I'll remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from us in Investor Relations.
Our presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures in an effort to provide additional information to investors. All non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to their related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC rules. You'll find reconciliation charts at the end of the presentation and in the form 8-K submitted to the SEC.
Before turning the call over to Martin, I want to remind you that at our investor briefing in late February we discussed a number of changes to our management system and our organizational structure. As a result our segment reporting structure has been updated to reflect our business structure. We provided two years of historical financial information by quarter on these segments a few weeks ago, this can be found in our investor website.
Today we'll be discussing first-quarter results in this new segment structure. In addition you'll see that we've updated our earnings presentation slides not only to address the new segment structure but also to provide additional disclosure on our strategic imperatives and to provide more commentary on the business drivers.
So with that, I'll turn the call to Martin Schroeter.
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Patricia. Again, this quarter, we've made a lot of progress in transforming our business, and we got done what we set out to do to start the year. We delivered $18.7 billion in revenue, $2.3 billion in net income and operating earnings per share of $2.35. Importantly, we also made significant investments and took significant actions to accelerate our transformation and move our business into new areas. Our enterprise clients are looking to get greater value from their data and IT environment. They're not just focused on reducing cost and driving efficiency but using data to improve decision-making and outcomes. They're looking to become digital enterprises that are differentiated by Cognitive.
Our strategy is based on the point of view it this requires a solutions-focused industry expertise and innovative technology, all supported by leading-edge skills. And so to move our clients into the future, we've been making significant changes to our business. We're not only transforming our existing businesses but building new markets and addressing new opportunity areas. We're creating Cognitive Solutions that marry digital business with digital intelligence. We're bringing our industry expertise together with these cognitive solutions and we're building it all on cloud platforms. And because we're running our clients' most critical business processes today, we're in a unique position to move them to the future.
We've been shifting investments and, resources and as we move our business forward we've also changed the way we run our business to be more aligned with these opportunity areas. We have proof points that we're making progress. This quarter, we continued our pattern of strong double-digit growth in our strategic imperatives. This revenue was up 17% at constant currency, which is consistent with our performance on the fourth quarter and continues to be substantially faster than the markets growth. I'll talk about our revenue results on a constant-currency basis throughout the presentation.
So now, over the last 12 months, strategic imperatives delivered $30 billion in revenue which represents 37% of our total revenue. That's two points ahead of where we were 90 days ago. In the quarter, our total cloud revenue grew 36% to $2.6 billion, with the as-a-service components growing 46%. Our annual run rate for the as-a-service revenue is now $5.4 billion. Our analytics revenue grew 9% on a locked base you'll recall as an $18 billion business for us last year. And mobile and security each posted strong double-digit growth.
As we transform our business and move into new areas we need to transform our workforce; not only the types of skills but how we operate. This quarter we took significant actions to transform our workforce and shift our skills base to new areas and to improve our structure primarily outside the U.S. This resulted in a pre-tax charge of just under $1.5 billion. As we discussed in late February, we also had a tax refund in the quarter of $1 billion plus interest. And so the amount of the tax benefit was essentially equivalent to the charges on an after-tax basis. It's important to recognize that these actions are impacting our profit and margins this quarter while improving our position for the future.
We're continuing to invest and add capabilities to build out our Cognitive and Cloud Platforms. I'll comment on a few items from the first quarter alone. We completed the acquisition of The Weather Company's digital assets. This is not only a source of valuable weather data but a high-volume, cloud-based, insight-driven platform. We're bringing this together with our organic Watson capabilities to form the basis of our Watson IoT platform.
This quarter we announced a number of partnerships with companies including VMware to accelerate the adoption of enterprise hybrid clouds, and GitHub to advance the development of next-gen cloud applications for enterprises. And we've brought Swift to the cloud, enabling mobile developers to build end-to-end mobile hybrid apps. We've integrated a portion of our software business into our cloud business, and all of IBM's relevant software is now in the IBM cloud.
We acquired Ustream and will bring it together with software and our object storage capabilities to extend our leadership in cloud video services. At the end of the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Bluewolf, a top Salesforce partner and leader in cloud consulting and implementation services.
GBS is already the largest digital design agency, and this quarter we extended our capabilities with the announcement of three acquisitions that will be integrated into IBM Interactive Experience.
We're continuing to expand our Watson ecosystem and reach. Over the last 12 months, the number of developers using Watson APIs is up over 300% and the number of enterprises we've engaged with has doubled. Watson solutions are being built, used, and deployed in more than 45 countries and across 20 different industries. And this quarter, we significantly added to our Watson Health platform with the acquisition of Truven, a leading provider of cloud-based healthcare data, analytics, and insights. This was announced in February and closed just over a week ago. I'll expand on these solutions and go into more detail on our strategic imperatives performance in the segment discussions.
But first, I'll turn to our financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was $18.7 billion. Currency continues to be a headwind to our reported revenue performance, over 2.5 points this quarter. This is 0.5 point better than the low end of the range we provided in mid-January, or about $90 million translation benefit. On a constant currency basis, our decline of 2% is consistent with last quarter. Now, within that 2% decline, when you consider the impact of the mainframe cycle and the additional content from acquisitions this quarter, our underlying revenue growth rate improved by 2 points versus the prior quarter.
From a geography perspective, our performance in the Americas was consistent with last quarter with improvement in the U.S. and a decline in Latin America driven by Brazil. We've built a strong business in Brazil over the years, though the last few quarters have been more volatile. This quarter Brazil was down, in part due to a tough compare but also an economic environment that looks uncertain. We've taken some action to refocus our business which impacts our growth in the short term. EMEA posted a modest decline while Asia-Pacific grew for the first time in quite a while.
Our gross margin performance reflects higher levels of investment and a mix impact within our segments. Our systems margin was up consistent with the product cycle dynamics in our z Systems as well as improvements in power and storage.
You can see our expense was up significantly, driven by charges for the actions to accelerate the transformation of our business. These charges impacted pre-tax income by $1.5 billion and pre-tax margin by 8 points in the quarter. I'll talk more about the charges and implications for the future later.
Our tax rate for the quarter reflects an underlying rate of 19% as well as the benefit from the resolution of a tax case outside the U.S. This was a discrete item and drove our tax rate negative.
From a cash perspective, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, about half of that coming from the tax benefit. Over the last 12 months, we've generated over $14 billion of free cash flow, and this is 110% of GAAP net income. Given the seasonality of our cash flow, it's best to look at realization on a trailing 12-month basis. And in the last year we returned about two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and gross share repurchases.
With the changes we've made to our management system and organizational structure, we've implemented a new segment structure. As Patricia mentioned, we provided historical information on this segment structure a few weeks ago. Before getting into results for this quarter, I want to spend a minute on the structure. Our segment discussions will also be a little longer than is typical to address the drivers and performance on this basis and the progress we're making in moving our business to the future.
So looking at the segments, Cognitive Solutions includes the solutions software addressing many of our strategic areas including analytics, security, and social as well as the transaction processing software. Many of these are new opportunity areas like Watson Health and Watson IoT, opening up revenue and profit pools beyond traditional IT. Because we're building new businesses in new markets, they'll ramp over time.
The scope of our Global Business Services segment overall is unchanged, though we're now providing our revenue results for consulting, global process services, and application management, which is aligned with the way we're now organized and going to market. GBS has been shifting its business towards the solution areas including creation of a cognitive consulting practice, and earlier this year GBS strengthened its industry capabilities.
As we bring the industry expertise together with Cognitive Solutions offerings, we'll put more focus on the combination of these two businesses, which we refer to as Cognitive Solutions and Industry Services.
Technology Services and Cloud Platforms includes our global technology services business and IBM's cloud infrastructure and platform capabilities. This business now includes WebSphere and related software products, reflecting the importance of integration software to the enterprise grade hybrid clouds.
Systems include our hardware offerings of z Systems, power and storage, and now also the related operating system software.
Global Financing is unchanged, consisting of client and commercial financing and used equipment sales.
Now, as we've said, the primary driver of the changes to our operating structure and subsequently our segments is the realignment of our software portfolio as software value shifts to new areas. Software is made up of our Cognitive Solutions segment, integration software, and operating system software. We've broken out the revenue and gross profit results within the segments, but as we transition to the new structure we'll also provide a perspective on total software. I'll talk about it after going through the four segment discussions, and we've also provided information in our supplemental charts. Given the solutions nature of our offerings, our strategic imperatives are included in each of our segments, and so going forward we're providing additional information on the strategic imperatives revenue within each segment.
So now let's turn to the segment performance, and I'll start Cognitive. I mentioned that solutions software includes analytic, security, and social. To give you some context, analytics is the largest part of our solutions portfolio and includes our traditional analytics platform, industry solutions, commerce, and the Watson-related businesses. Transaction processing software, on the other hand, primarily runs mission-critical systems in industries like banking, airlines, and retail. This includes our offerings such as CICS, TPS, and IMS running on z Systems which were primarily reflected in other middleware in our previously reported software segment. Most of it is on-premise and annuity in nature, and not a growing opportunity in the software market.
In the first quarter, Cognitive Solutions generated revenue of $4 billion, which was up modestly year-to-year. Solutions software grew, mitigated by a decline in transaction processing software. Our solutions software growth of 3% was a significant sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. Contributing to this growth was strong double-digit performance in our Watson cloud based offerings and acquisitive content. From an offering perspective, the growth was led by analytics and security. In both of these areas, we have highly differentiated strategies and capabilities.
Security isn't just about trying to keep things out; we approach security as a big data problem. On average today, organizations use 80 security products from 40 different vendors, and they're looking for us to bring all this together. We're in a unique position as we not only provide our own leading capabilities but bring it all together for them in an integrated solution. Security solutions are a mix of on-premise software and software-as-a-service, and we believe we have the largest enterprise security software-as-a-service business.
Our leadership and momentum continued into the first quarter with high single-digit growth in our security software, outpacing the market. In addition, we continue to invest to build our security platform, and we've recently acquired Resilient Systems, which provides leading incident response capabilities. This acquisition expands our overall leadership in security where we lead the market in four out of six security segments. With our differentiated strategy and our market leadership, we can attract the best talent in a very competitive market. We now have more than 7,000 security experts, maybe more than 1,000 in the last year. We can attract top talent because we're not just identifying problems and doing audits, we're solving security problems.
Our approach in analytics is also unique and differentiated. We're building an industrial strength cognitive platform that is cloud-based and leverages Watson. It's also supported by industry-specific data and an ecosystem to help provide new insights in key industries. This allows us to go after a new $2 trillion market opportunity beyond the $1.2 trillion traditional IT market. So it's a new and incremental opportunity for us.
Watson Healthcare is our first industry-focused area, where we're creating a new market. This is an industry with billions of dollars of new revenue opportunity for IBM. We started to move into the cognitive healthcare space just about a year ago and have invested $4 billion through four acquisitions. We're scaling rapidly, moving from effectively no employees to more than 6,000 in a year. Most came to us through the acquisitions, but we've also hired nearly 700 employees who are highly skilled healthcare professionals who will now make a difference in millions of lives. We believe success will be based on building platforms, and we're focused on leveraging partnerships and ecosystems.
We're now working with clients such as the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, and Under Armour, in addition to initial partners of Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, CVS, and many more. As I mentioned, in early April we closed our Truven acquisition that brings more than 8,500 clients to our Watson Health portfolio, including employers, health insurers, hospitals, clinicians, life sciences companies, and government agencies that support health programs. Data and insights from Truven inform benefit decisions for one in three Americans.
We're already seeing the signs of our strategy playing out. In the first quarter we closed deals with a few large healthcare insurers, who have millions of members that can use our Watson Health cloud-based solutions. We believe that the healthcare industry is moving to value-based care. It is still early stages, but as the market shifts, we're positioned to deliver value.
We're also broadening the reach of Watson as it starts to support an increasing number of decisions. Let me share a few more examples. When we first introduced Watson, it could reach a population of 400 million English-speaking people. As Watson has been taught more languages, it can now speak with another billion people in their native language. We are working on our Watson oncology solution with a number of hospitals that have a combined reach of more than three million patients.
You heard from a few of our healthcare clients on Investor Day. Let me comment on another in insurance that has Watson in production. Geico is using Watson in 46 states to enhance aspects of their industry-leading digital channel. They're encouraged by the results they have seen with existing and new policyholders in areas including online experience, engagement, and sales.
So now, looking at the profit results for this segment, the gross margin is impacted by a lower level of transactional revenue and the fact that more of our new areas where we're investing are cloud-based and build over time. The pre-tax income performance also reflects a higher level of investment in areas like Watson Platform, Watson Health, and Watson IoT, as well as an impact from workforce rebalancing charges and currency.
Global Business Services delivered $4.1 billion of revenue, which is down 2%. As I mentioned earlier, Global Business Services segment content in total did not change, but within GBS we are now reporting consulting, global process services, and application management, consistent with the way we're running the business.
Our application management business helps modernize a client's application processes and brings apps to market faster through digital cloud platforms like Bluemix. Our application management revenue represents about 45% of GBS revenue. Performance was relatively stable last year and that continued into the first quarter.
In consulting, which is another 45% or so of our revenue, the process of shifting to the new areas continues to impact our growth rate, but we did see some improvement versus the prior quarter. Global process services revenue, which is less than 10% of GBS revenue, was down 1%.
At our investor briefing in February, we spent time on the shift that we're driving in GBS away from some of the more traditional areas into the more strategic areas. This quarter, GBS revenue in the strategic imperatives was up 22%, with strong growth across our cloud, analytics, mobility, and security practices.
We're expanding our design capabilities as consumer-grade experience is becoming a new strategy for enterprises. This quarter, we announced three acquisitions that will be integrated into the IBM Interactive Experience, the largest global digital agency. Through our experienced design capabilities, we're able to bring clients the distinct combination of industry insight, design thinking, and end-to-end digital transformation. We are delivering high-value digital services in over 25 studios worldwide, including a new studio in Dubai that we announced this quarter.
We are investing in expanding our skills in other areas as well. We've recently announced the acquisition of Bluewolf, which has over 500 resources across the U.S., Europe, and Australia. This will extend our industry consulting leadership with one of the world's leading salesforce consulting practices to deliver differentiated consumer-grade experiences through the cloud.
Our Apple partnership continues to redesign workflows and drive productivity for our clients. We recently announced strategic mobile transformation products with RWE Generation in Germany for mobile maintenance of heavy mining equipment; with Alior Bank in Poland to transform the way clients experience banking services; and with Etisalat in Egypt to deploy the Expert Tech app and transform how its remote site support technicians deliver services to their customers.
Turning to GBS profit, our gross margin was down about a point and a half as we continue to invest to drive our transformation. We're engineering the shift of our resources to higher-value services, which has a near-term impact on our margin. Our strategy is based on moving to higher value, so we'll continue this shift. We continue to see price and profit pressure in some parts of the portfolio. Looking at pre-tax profit performance, more than half the margin decline is driven by the structural actions we took this quarter. At the same time, we continue to invest in our digital and cognitive practices. These actions will help us progress our transformation in GBS.
Technology Services and Cloud Platforms delivered $8.4 billion of revenue, up 2%. For the segment, our strategic imperative revenue was up 45%, driven by our cloud revenue which was up 50%. Our view on cloud is that enterprises see the most value in hybrid cloud solutions that enable new business models while leveraging existing systems and data. We brought Global Technology Services closer together with IBM's cloud infrastructure and platform capabilities to better position us to deliver these solutions to our clients.
We will provide a view of infrastructure services, technical support services, and integration software. Infrastructure services reflects our evolution from a systems integrator to a services integrator, driven by the move to hybrid cloud. It includes our previous strategic outsourcing and integrated technology services lines.
Technical support services provides a complete line of support services to maintain and improve the ability of clients' IT infrastructures. This includes maintenance for both IBM and non-IBM products as well as some support previously reported in integrated technology services.
Infrastructure services was up 4% this quarter as clients continue to turn to us as a trusted partner to modernize their most critical IT systems and move them to hybrid. For example, at Chubb, we're implementing a new hybrid cloud model designed to enhance customer service and strengthen their industry practices. This new agile infrastructure will be designed to fit a wide variety of business needs, including enhanced user experience, faster deployment of services, and increased speed to market.
We're also working with one of Indostat, one of Indonesia's largest telecommunications and services providers that serves 70 million mobile customers. They need a cloud partner with scale, and we will deliver solutions on the IBM cloud that will help Indonesian businesses drive innovation and agility, streamline their process, and improve productivity.
We continue to see strong momentum in software, which again grew to strong double digits this quarter. We continue to invest to build out our global capability, announcing a new cloud datacenter in South Africa to support large regional service provider clients like Gijima and Vodacom.
Earlier this quarter, about 25,000 clients and partners attended our global InterConnect conference where we made some important announcements as we continue to evolve the IBM cloud. We announced that 100% of relevant software is now available in the cloud through a series of offerings such as WebSphere Connect where more than 200 million global licenses can now access the cloud. This fundamentally transforms how enterprise clients extend their existing IT investments and capabilities to the cloud.
We also announced we are the first to bring the Swift programming language to the server. Swift is used by about 11 million developers to build Apple iOS applications to radically simplify the development of end-to-end applications and help enterprises reach new levels of productivity.
We also launched several important strategic partnerships as we continue to build out our ecosystem. With VMware, we've jointly designed an architecture and cloud offering that will allow nearly half a million VMware customers to extend their virtual machines to the IBM cloud. And with GitHub, we'll be delivering an enterprise offering to the more than 12 million developers that will allow them to build and run applications consistently across public and private environments.
We continue to expand our cloud capabilities with the acquisition of Ustream and the formation of the IBM cloud video services unit that will that will provide our clients with a powerful portfolio of video services and digital analytics. Ustream provides cloud-based video streaming and on-demand video to about 80 million viewers per month for customer such as Facebook, Nike, the Discovery Channel, Samsung, and NASA.
Looking at the software content in this segment, integration software was down 2%. Our annuity content is growing with stability in our on-premises content and acceleration in the adoption of SaaS, specifically in the products that integrate a hybrid cloud environment, like application servers and our Connect family of products.
Looking at profit, Technology Services and Cloud Platforms' gross margin was down just over a point year-to-year. Margin is impacted by the revenue trajectory of integration software as we move more of the portfolio to an as-a-service model delivered through the cloud. Within infrastructure services, we're investing to contemporize our clients' IT systems as we bring on new contracts.
At the pre-tax profit level, our margin decline reflects the continued investment to build up platforms such as Bluemix and SoftLayer as we drive our transformation as well as currency impacts. This quarter also includes the impact of the workforce transformation actions, which is about half of the decline.
Our Systems segment comprises our systems hardware business and operating system software. Systems revenue was about $1.7 billion this quarter, which was down about 20%. Our hardware revenue was down 25%, primarily reflecting the product cycle in our z Systems. Operating systems continue to be a headwind to growth. This quarter, the revenue was down 7%.
So looking at the hardware performance by brand, our z Systems revenue was down 40% on the back of a very strong performance of up 130% last year when we launched our new z13. Typically, we see better margins in z Systems as we move into the back half of the cycle, and we did see some good margin improvement this quarter.
After four quarters of growth, Power revenue was down double digits as we ramped on a strong performance in UNIX-based entry systems from last year. But we had continued momentum in our Linux offerings and expansion of OpenPOWER efforts. We've been focused on the growth in Power-based Linux systems and they've now grown to about 10% of the overall revenue base.
We recently signed a deal with a large enterprise in China that is dramatically growing its Linux server footprint, and has chosen Linux on Power partly because they can do it with half of the footprint they would have required with x86. The relationship will lead to the installation of thousands of Linux on Power Systems.
We also continued to see good traction with the OpenPOWER Foundation-based innovations, which will ultimately drive adoption of the Power platform and provide intellectual property income. Just a few weeks ago, Google, a founding member of the OpenPOWER Foundation, announced that it is working with Rackspace, an Open Compute Project founding member, to codevelop an open server specification based around IBM's new POWER9 architecture. The two companies will submit a candidate POWER9 server design to the Open Compute Project.
Turning to Storage, hardware revenue was down 6%, which continues to reflect weakness in the overall storage market. We are well positioned to capture the strategic growth areas of flash, software-defined storage, and object storage, which together grew in the quarter.
Our Systems gross profit margin was up with improvement across z Systems, Power, and Storage. Our pre-tax income decline reflects the improved gross margin on the lower revenue and the impact of the actions we took this quarter, which is about half of the decline.
So now, let me come back to the performance of software across our segments. Our total software revenue was down less than 1%. This is a significant improvement from our performance last quarter, which was down 6%. We got the improvement we expected from the higher mix of annuity versus transactional content in the first quarter. In addition, we've been adding a lot of new capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions, and this quarter software growth reflected the acquisitions which closed over the last year. These acquisitions contribute to revenue growth but impact our profit performance in the first year.
Our annuity revenue was up 2% in the quarter with steady renewal rates and growth in our SaaS business. From a product area perspective, growth in our solutions software was offset by a continued headwind in operating systems and transaction processing software.
Let me make one other comment on our software performance. As I mentioned earlier, total software includes cognitive solutions, integration software, and operating systems. This includes a portion of our software support line revenue that was previously reported in our GTS segment. The addition of support line did not impact our software growth rate this quarter. Our software revenue was down 0.8 points including support line and would've been down 0.8 points without support line.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated $3.3 billion of cash from operations in the quarter excluding our financing receivables and $2.3 billion of free cash flow. This is up over $1 billion year-to-year. This year-to-year increase was driven by the tax benefit of $1 billion plus interest. As I mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions that impacted our profit this quarter and will impact our cash flow over the next several quarters.
Looking at the uses of cash in the quarter, we invested just under $1 billion in capital expenditures with continued investment in cloud capacity. We closed six acquisitions this quarter, and acquisition spend was over $2.5 billion, with the largest being The Weather Company transaction. The Truven acquisition closed about a week and a half ago and so will be included in our second quarter acquisition spend.
We returned over $2 billion to shareholders including $1.2 billion in dividends, and we bought back over 6.5 million shares. At the end of March we had $4.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Looking at the balance sheet highlights, we ended the quarter with nearly $15 billion in cash and $46 billion in total debt, both of which are up an equivalent amount from year-end, driven by the timing of this year's term debt issuances. About $27 billion of our total debt was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7:1.
I want to mention that the credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 51% investment grade, which you can see in the supplemental charts. We had a few point reduction in investment grade over the last couple of quarters driven by rating changes in our existing portfolio, not by changes in how we approach the market. Now, this data is based on the credit ratings of the companies in our portfolio. We do take actions to transfer exposure to third parties where we then get the credit ratings of the insurance companies. We've done this for many years. And on that basis, our investment-grade content increases by 14 points to 65%.
Our non-financing debt was $18.8 billion, up year-to-year driven by the timing of our debt issuances this year relative to the maturities, and as I mentioned, the increase is equivalent to the increase in cash. We continue to be very well positioned to support our long-term growth strategy.
Let me spend a minute on some of the larger items that impacted the first quarter results and give you a sense of the implications of these actions for the balance of the year. The tax benefit contributed about $1.20 to EPS. As I mentioned, our underlying tax rate was 19% in the quarter, consistent with the range we provided at the beginning of the year of 18% plus or minus a couple of points. This, of course, doesn't include discrete or one-time items.
As we transform our business, we need to transform our workforce, and in this quarter we took a pre-tax charge for workforce rebalancing of $1 billion or $0.84 of earnings per share. Some of this charge is used to take action where we've been dealing with underutilization, but the vast majority is to shift and rebalance our skills.
As we build new businesses in areas like Watson Health and Watson Internet of Things, this requires different skills and to be in different places. I mentioned earlier that over the last year we've added over 6,000 resources in Watson Health and added over 1,000 security experts. These are specialized skills in highly competitive areas. So this is not about reducing our capacity; this is about transforming our workforce. We started the year with just under 380,000 people. We have people leaving the business, but we're also adding large numbers of resources. We currently have tens of thousands of open positions, and we're hiring aggressively. So if we have similar hiring dynamics to last year, we could end the year with an employee base that is about the same as where we started. Our hiring will be aligned to where we see demand, by skill area, and by geography. As we look at the resource actions, about 90% of the spending is outside the U.S.
Now, looking at the returns on this action, we expect we'll save about $500 million this year, maybe a little more, and nearly $2 billion on an annualized basis. When you look at the makeup of the $1 billion charge, a couple hundred was in the run rate and drives the bulk of the $500 million savings this year. The balance of the charge was for actions that yield the remainder due to geographic mix and timing. But as I said, this is about rebalancing skills rather than capacity reduction, and so we think about this as spending that is freed up to be reinvested in building capabilities in our strategic imperatives.
As we transform our workforce, we're changing how we're working, more agile, more collaboratively, and this requires a different work environment. So this quarter, we took a real estate charge of over $300 million as we changed the way we work, moving to agile with less space required. We also took actions to reposition the business in Latin America in light of the macro conditions. I mentioned earlier that we've refocused our business in Brazil including reducing exposure in our financing and services portfolio this quarter. We also reduced our exposure in Venezuela.
As you know, we've always had some unique items in the quarter, but we've included here the items that accelerate our transformation. We didn't include for example the nearly $40 million loss from the sale of our remaining equity position in Lenovo. We have no future exposure there.
So we made good progress in transforming our business this quarter. We continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives, and as I've said earlier, they now represent 37% of our revenue. We added significant capabilities this quarter through organic investments, acquisitions, and partnerships, and we took significant actions to improve our position for the long term. As we look forward, we expect much of what we saw in the first quarter to continue. We expect to drive strong growth in our strategic imperatives.
Our acquisitions are starting to contribute to our top line, and while they are a drag on profit in the first few quarters, they will certainly contribute to the profit base over time. We will continue to invest at a high level. Much of the capabilities we're building are cloud-based and delivered as a service. Both the higher investment levels and the return profile put some pressure on our profit in the near term but we're confident it's right for the long term. As I just mentioned, we'll start to yield some of the benefits from the actions we just took but we do expect much of it to be reinvested. When we take all of this into consideration, we continue to expect at least $13.50 of operating earnings per share for the year.
You'll recall that last quarter I said that we expect free cash flow realization of GAAP net income in the 90s, which implied a range of $11 billion to $12 billion of free cash flow for the year at the $13.50 level. We have now improved our view of free cash flow for the year and now expect free cash flow to come in at the high end of that range at that same profit level.
As we look at the second quarter, we typically see a profit improvement from first to second quarter. In fact, last year, it was $1 billion increase in pre-tax income. This year, we expect more given the significant charges in our first quarter, but we'll also have an impact from the acquisition ramp and quarter-to-quarter impact from currency hedges. Put it all together and we see about a $2 billion increase in pre-tax profit from first to second quarter. With our anticipated tax rate and our share repurchase, at that profit level we'd achieve between 38% and 39% of the $13.50 of earnings per share by the end of the first half.
So to finish, again, this quarter we made a lot of progress in transforming our business and we got done what we set out to do to start the year. Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. These too have been updated to reflect the new segment structure and additional information provided. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.
Operator, let's please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. One moment, please, for the first question. First question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Thanks, Martin, for all the detail. Just to build on your closing comment on the original 15% from last quarter, timing-wise, what shifted from what you expected? Or is there some conservatism to consider? Because I guess with what you reported, it looks like actual could be around 17.5% of the full-year guidance.
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Tien-tsin. So, you're right. If we were just to line up the math of where we finished relative to the at least $13.50 at that base level, we'd be about 17%. So the first quarter, I would say I'd characterize a couple of ways. One, on the top line, we got done what we wanted to get done and, in fact, the signposts that we've given to our investor community around driving double-digit growth while we continue to invest in those areas played out pretty much as we expected. And we are growing our revenue in those strategic imperatives faster than the marketplace, which we think is an important element as we transform the business.
On the profit side, the first quarter played out kind of the way we said we would get done what we would in February, which was we were going to get a tax benefit and that we were going to accelerate the transformation. So we put of all of that together and while – because we had some of the restructuring already in the run rate, if you will, we did better, if you will, than what the original guidance implied. So the math you're doing is kind of spot on relative to that $13.50. We are seeing the dynamics in the revenue lines that we had expected and we're seeing the profit equation come together as we kind of expected, again, given that nuance that we had some of the restructuring in the run rate.
The other thing I'd point out, what's not in yet is obviously some of the newer acquisition content. We closed on Truven about a week and a half ago. We closed on The Weather Company's digital assets during the quarter, so not a full quarter. Those come also with our intent to grow the spending in those to create new solutions. So when they come in, at whatever profitability they were, we build our business cases around substantial investment in those two. So we'll get the revenue but the profit impact, as we said in the prepared remarks, will last for a couple of quarters.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Tien-tsin. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify something, just because you said it very quickly at the end of the call, and then I have a real question. So you're guiding for 38% to 39% of earnings in the first half, which I think implies $2.85 in EPS for Q2. That's about $0.60 below consensus, and only about a 21% increase sequentially. Historically I think you're at 30% or 35%. So I just want to be sure I did the math right on that. That's the clarification.
And my real question is, it's really just where you think you are in the transformation. We continue to see really good growth on the strategic imperatives. But revenue growth at constant currency was minus 2 and I think on an organic basis was probably about minus 3. And that's kind of at the low end of what you've done over the last eight quarters or so. So maybe you could help us understand, is it just the combination of the transformation still requiring time? Or is there something about the move to an as-a-service model? But why aren't we seeing some gradual improvement in revenue on a constant currency basis? And can you help us understand, is there something that you either anniversary or overlap, or when investors should think about seeing that inflection point in terms of improving revenues?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Thanks, Toni. So first, on your clarifying non-question, I think the way you described it is what we said. We said we'd get 38% to 39% of the first half done, and your math was right on. The one thing, though, I think it's important to remember, and I know you know this, but I think we ought to bear in mind the business looks fundamentally different as we transform it. And so, using first-half averages from days gone by when currency was different and the level of transformation and the pace of transformation was different and the levels of investment were different, I would caution our investors to make sure they understand the underpinnings of that. And so that's why we laid out, if you will, within my prepared remarks – that's why we laid out what we saw happening in this quarter from first to second. So again, your math was right, we said 38% to 39%. But again, there is a lot more going on within the transformation than just the statistics. And I think it's important to understand the componentry.
In terms of where we are in the transformation, I think I'd make a few comments. One, continued growth in the strategic imperatives – as you said, good growth and we're pleased with the double-digit growth. It's a big part of how we're measuring our progress. The other element that we're measuring, and we talked about this at Investor Day and it holds true as well in the first is, are the spaces we're going to, are they generating higher value than the spaces we're moving from? And as we showed at Investor Day, our gross margins in those new areas continue to be higher, and they were higher again in the first. So that's an important element for us. Again, grow those businesses and make sure they're higher value.
At the same time, part of our transformation is to create new opportunities. And so we spent a bit of time at Investor Day, as you know, talking about not only the traditional IT opportunity. And I would put things like our new cloud video services unit into that, where we get to apply a globally scalable cloud approach on an industry basis with our industry expertise. And so that's a good example of how we're shifting into new areas in the cloud world in the traditional space. But part of this transformation is all about moving into businesses that don't yet exist.
And so when you mention, is it as-a-service, is it something else, these are as-a-service businesses, and so we do expect there to take a while to ramp. But we did get to put a lot of money to work over the past 12 months. In fact, our acquisition activity over the last 12 months, if you include Truven now – so we just closed Truven about a week and a half ago – we spent about $9 billion now over that time period on acquisitions, which is more than we've spent in any 12-month period in IBM. So, part of this is also on building those new businesses.
So where are we in the transformation? It is continued focus on shifting our investments into those strategic imperatives, it is making sure that the space we're moving to is higher margin and higher profit opportunity for us and then making sure we're investing aggressively to keep those businesses growing.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Toni. Rowena, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes. Thanks, Martin. The software and the GBS businesses have the highest strategic content, and both of those declines improved from what you outlined happened in 2015 at the Analyst Day. At the same time, deferred revenue grew for the first time in almost two years, which is tied to at least the software portion of the business. So, just curious if you isolate those two segments where you've had some big headwinds. Do you feel like you're moving beyond that and you've seen a sustainable turn in those businesses? Or is there something about annuity versus transactional mix in the first quarter where we shouldn't assume that those businesses continue to get better? Thank you.
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Katy. So, a couple of things. First, on software, we did talk about in January that we would we'd get an improved trajectory in our software business just from the mix of transactional annuity, and we did get that. So we did see an improvement from the mix in lower transactional content in the first, then in the fourth that drove some improvement.
Secondly, we also got a benefit from the acquisition content that closed. That added about 2 points as well to the software performance. So with the annuity component of our software business continuing to grow, with the acquisition content coming in, I do feel okay about our software business going forward and the acquisitions that we've completed more recently will also help support that software business. So from a revenue perspective I feel okay about the investments we've made and the future of the software business.
Now, on the profit side, those take spending to create the kinds of solutions that we think will create new markets, so we'll continue to invest heavily, but the improvement we got from the mix was what we said we would get in the first and then we got the benefit of acquisitions as well.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Very good...
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, Katy. You also asked about GBS. So on GBS, we did see a sequential improvement from fourth to first, and we saw that in our consulting business as well. Now, in the GBS business, the strategic imperatives content continues to do fine in the GBS business, and we'll continue to shift our labor pools and our expertise into those. And you saw that we made some acquisitions in that digital channel to create – again, to keep our lead, I should say, in being the world's largest digital agency.
What you also saw us do over the last few months now in GBS is we moved – we continued to move our business to where we see the greatest consulting opportunities. And quite frankly, we stayed in these big ERP implementations a bit too long. And so now, what you saw us buy a few months ago was a company called Meteorix, which is really built around helping companies move into workday solutions. And then you saw us recently announced the acquisition of a company called Bluewolf, which works on sales force implementations.
And so as the world moves into what we've always said it would, which is that the shift to cloud creates consulting opportunities because companies have to fundamentally change workflow, we did, quite frankly, move a little bit late, so we're playing a little bit of catch-up in that part of the business. But with these two acquisitions, we'll drive growth in what are two pretty hot market opportunities and we'll continue then to pull resources away from that commoditizing content and drive more the shift into the strategic imperatives.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Katy. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Yes, Ma'am. Thank you. Next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. You may ask your question.
David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thanks. So, Martin, can I just quickly follow up on your software comment? So based on current visibility, can growth stay on this trajectory in the more seasonally difficult second quarter, and will acquisitions actually contribute more in the June quarter given the first quarter activity?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So the simple answer is that acquisitions that we've gotten done now will add again to the growth rate in the second quarter. If I looked at – if we look at just the Cognitive Solutions segment as an example, part of that business, our transaction processing system business – that's a very high value business. It declined 5% in the quarter, but it's in a declining market opportunity space. And so we're providing very high value to our clients. We run their most important transaction systems. We'll continue to do that. We'll continue to refresh those products that delivers the new capability, but quite frankly, that is an opportunity that will decline over time. But again, we'll decline with it. We won't lose share.
When we look at the software solutions part of that Cognitive segment, you saw that we got back to low single-digit growth in the first, and with the acquisition content we see that continuing to accelerate even in the second already. So that acquisition content will help bolster the software results as we go through the rest of the year.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, David. Can we take the next question please?
Rowena? We can't hear anything from our side, Rowena?
Operator
Yes. Hello? Yes. Hello. Our next question is from Louis Miscioscia from CLSA. You may ask your question.
Louis Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC
Okay. Thank you. So going back to GBS again, you have strategic imperatives there at $3.1 billion, and that the total category is $4.1 billion. So when we look at the revenue, should we assume that that $1 billion that's not in the strategic imperative that's not growing is what's basically got a wind-down? And maybe you could give us an idea of how quickly you think you can transfer that over, or maybe I just couldn't (52:45) do the math on the percent decline, if that's accurate?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I guess the way to think about it is that within the Global Business Services, that the areas we're moving out of have a lot of price pressure. So implementing these large-scale ERP implementations, we see a lot of price pressure in there. And the areas we're moving into are continuing to grow pretty well, but we're building those. By the way, they're going to take a while to build. Some of them are brand-new practices. So as an example, we just announced the creation last year, at the end of last year, of a cognitive practice. That doesn't exist anywhere. It's the world's first. We are building skills there.
So within the GBS segment, again, this shift we've been working on, we were a little bit late in some parts of it and moving more into – if you will, moving more into the consulting side of this. But we have the total of strategic imperatives is within that segment is about $2 billion of the $4.1 billion. The chart that you may be looking at is not additive, right? The strategic imperatives are $2 billion. The cloud element is $600 million; that's within the $2 billion. And then the as-a-service is $0.5 billion; that's within that as well. So it's not additive, it's not three – one of the four; it's two of the four with those two as the components.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Lou. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Milunovich from UBS. You may ask your question.
Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you. A couple of quick ones. Number one, the currency impact last quarter, you said, would be $1.10 hit to earnings this year. With currency now improved, what is that number likely to be? Number two, free cash flow. You said $11 billion to $12 billion; now, at the high end. Is the only difference the $1.2 billion that you received in the tax rebate, or has anything else changed in your underlying view? And then third, do you expect any more restructuring charges this year? Are those in your guidance at all?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Steve, thank you for the non-multipart – no, it's okay Steve. As you said, they are quick. They're good questions because it's all important data. So first, on constant currency, we said that in total, the currency impact would be over $1 billion for us in the year. Now, bear in mind that a big part of that, the bulk of that, almost all of it, was because of the hedges we had last year which we're not going to get this year. So we had to work our way through that. Now, at current rates, obviously we see – we still see the same size impact from the hedges because those were there last year. At current rates we would get a bit of a translation benefit, but I think it's really important to recognize that while as much as we like to think this is uniform on both sides of a dollar move, and we do believe that a weaker dollar on balance helps us, a weaker dollar also drives renegotiation in price and other things that come into the equation. So the impact at this point, the hedge impact on the currency rates today is obviously exactly the same. We'd do a little bit better at this point in profit if we were able to keep it; we'd do a little bit better there for the rest of the year.
On free cash flow, I'd say it really is – I wouldn't attribute it all to the tax that we got back. I would attribute it to we're through 90 days, we've have $100-plus billion balance sheet, and when we look at the ins and outs and the efficiency of the balance sheet, we feel incrementally more positive about the realization for the year.
And then on restructuring, this is something where – and we tried to go through this a bit in the prepared remarks – it really is about shifting the work force from a set of skills that have value in the marketplace today to a new set of skills where we're trying and build new businesses. The minority of the charge, if you will, is for reductions in usable capacity, and most of that's outside the U.S. The bulk of this is to get new set of skills. So as we build a Watson Health business, as we build out our security practice, we're adding new skills. So we'll see.
We think about our ability to acquire skills. In many of these sectors, we will hire them as quickly as the world can create them. We hired 1,000 security experts last year and quite frankly, if world created 2,000 of the caliber and the kind of talent we needed, we would've hired 2,000. But the world creates these skills at a certain rate and we'll hire them as aggressively as we can. We have some limits in terms of how do we put them to work and where's the demand and does that all match up, but we'll hire people as aggressively as we can as we build these businesses out. We are relying on some pretty unique talents in some these businesses.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Steve. Can we take the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, thank you. Next question is from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the services business, what you're seeing there specifically as it relates to your customers' discretionary spending outlook for services. You had a very strong signing quarter last quarter, but that was not so strong this quarter. I think it was down 17% year-over-year. Understanding that that can be very lumpy, does it say anything about the discretionary outlook for services among your clients? And can you maybe just address when we might expect to see that margin inflection in GBS?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So, a couple things. On services, in terms of signings, as you said, they tend to be lumpy. Maybe not the most elegant of words to describe it, but it is an accurate description of what happens in any 90-day period. Quite frankly, when you look at the kinds of relationships we're building with our clients, neither the IBM teams involved that are building these nor our clients are thinking about these on a 90-day cycle. These are pretty big, transformative partnerships that we build, and they're running and trusting us to run their most important and most critical systems. So it's completely understandable why a 90-day reporting cycle may not work.
We also have looked, and we've told our investors over time to look at the backlog. So when you look, for instance, within the GTS business, our backlog, even with the signings performance in the quarter, but because we've had strong signings last year we grew the backlog 1%.
And I think that's indicative of the kind of demand profile we see for those kinds of services. Remember, within that business there is certainly an element of productivity, i.e. our clients are asking us to do and manage that for them in a way that gets them to a sustainable economic model, which means we need to deliver productivity quite regularly. And then it also includes a lot of what they want in terms of moving into hybrid cloud environments and taking advantage of the investments they've already made in their own systems plus getting the agility from us running their cloud.
So that services business, again, the demand profile I'd say looks more like that low single-digit kind of growth rate, which is evident in the backlog. And then we'll – again, given the transformative nature of some these deals, we'll sign them when they're ready and when they're complete.
In terms of margin on GBS, we've talked a fair bit about what we're going through with GBS. The only thing I'd add to the comments we've made is, again, we continue to see that the areas and the spaces we're moving to are more valuable as measured by gross profit margin, if you will. They're more valuable than where we're coming from, and so we see certainly a bright future. Now, it's just a matter of getting that weighting right and working our way through the transition and transformation of that, where we have a bit of a productivity impact as well.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Jim. Rowena, can we take the next question?
Operator
Yes ma'am, thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Could you just talk about the workforce transformation that you guys are implementing right now? What sort of gross savings are you guys targeting to get? I realize the net number may be fairly modest, but – just what sort of gross savings you think you can get, when does that start? And then the M&A contribution, can you just talk about what total revenues and strategic growth looks like on a organic basis, ex currency, ex M&A?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Amit. A couple of things. So on savings, if you will, and as you've pointed out, we're going to – we expect that we'll reinvest a lot of the savings as we start to realize them and as we start to achieve the savings. So in the prepared remarks and in the charts we've distributed, we've actually laid out quarter-by-quarter when we would expect to get about that $500 million or so of savings this year. And then we've also identified on a full year basis, that this frees up – for our spend rate, it frees up about $2 billion that we will now look to shift into these new areas. That's how we think about it. Again, this is not about capacity reduction; it's actually about moving into these new areas where we see new opportunities.
And then from a revenue perspective, as I covered in the prepared remarks, in the first quarter, the contribution from acquisitions in terms of revenue growth was under a point. Now, we've since closed Truven in April and we didn't have The Weather Company, for instance, in the full quarter, so we'll get a bit over a point as we go into the second. But we don't see – it's not adding 3 or 4 or 5 points here. It really is a point to 2 points as we go into the second in terms of acquisition contribution to revenue growth.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Amit. Can we take the next question please?
Operator
Yes ma'am, thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup. You may ask your question.
James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks very much. I was taking a look at your supplemental information on slide 20, and you discuss the signings down 17% year-over-year. And I understand that they're kind of lumpy. Could you address the service backlog, which was down 1% year-over-year, and help us understand how mathematically that number is adjusted for acquisitions that are coming in the year? Thank you.
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So, the first one or the second part of that, the acquisitions we're making are in things like software businesses. They are in as-a-service businesses. There's nothing in the backlog from acquisitions. So in the back-up information – and first, Jim, I do want to say, since we put so much time into all these backup charts, I do appreciate that someone's looking at them all, so thank you for that. In the services backlog of down 1%, there are really two components. One is, as I mentioned a couple of questions ago, the GTS component of that continues to grow about 1%, so think of it as low single-digit. And I think that's a good reflection of the demand environment for the kinds of services integrators that our GTS business is becoming.
The other piece of that is the GBS backlog, which is down 5%. So that down 1% is up 1% for GTS down 5%. And that's a reflection of our shift out of these large ERP implementations and the need for us to build some of these new businesses like Cognitive. So there's not a lot of, obviously, Cognitive signings in that backlog yet because we've created the practice within the last six months, and we're building the skill base and we're building the relationships with our clients. It's really those two dynamics. It's pretty good, stable growth – stable but growing in GTS and a decline in GBS as we shift into those new areas.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President-Investor Relations
Okay, Rowena. Why don't we take one last question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Last question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.
Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes, thank you. Martin, you took the opportunity to invest at a higher rate given the tax refund to accelerate your transformation. How should investors think about that acceleration? Will you get to your goals and strategic imperatives revenue faster than 2018 because you're now investing at a higher pace and acquiring these skill sets, or perhaps throw off higher cash flow faster? And if accelerating the transformation is the right move, then why not like increase leverage and reinvest more aggressively for the remainder of the year as well instead of sort of waiting for the tax refund?
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, a couple of things, Wamsi. So, we are investing quite aggressively here. And I run the deal committee. We have pretty active discussions still on what else we should acquire in order to build, again, new businesses, to extend the lead that we have in a business. So we'll keep doing that and we'll think prudently about where we deploy our capital.
Now, in terms of spend rates, as I mentioned, investments are shifting our workforce, if you will, investing are changing the way we operate. It's changing the way we engage with one another. So if the world created 5,000 cognitive experts, we would hire 5,000 cognitive experts. We already have, by the way, the largest private math department in the world, and so we are absorbing, if you will, the skills that we need for our business in order to drive these.
But there is a rate at which it doesn't make sense for us to keep putting money into these because the world doesn't create them any more. It's not a problem that can be solved by spending more money. It's a problem that is constrained by the kinds of skills the world's creating. So we have a global search on for talent. People come to IBM and we got about 1.2 million applications – applicants I should say. We've got more applications, but 1.2 million applicants. They come here in order to work with the leaders in their fields. What we find is that skills have gravity and highly skilled people want to work with others in their fields who are also highly skilled. So they come here to work with our unique data sets, with our unique technologies, with our unique industry expertise, in order to change the way the world works in order to change the way industries operate, in order to change professions. And we'll do that as fast as we can, but you can get a sense – I think we talked earlier, not in this call but in prior calls, that we hired 70,000 people last year out of the 1.2 million applicants. It takes a while to find the right people, so we'll invest as fast as the world creates the skills we need.
Martin J. Schroeter - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So let me wrap up the call because we got a lot done in the quarter, and quite frankly I think we're pretty well positioned for the future. The new structure that we have been talking about which reflects our management system, we expect that it will facilitate our move to a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company, and it will also help our investors understand where we're making investments and where we seeing returns.
We introduced the structure just in February. We provided the history back in March as we said we would, and now it's the first quarter that we're reporting. So hopefully, with what we've done in this transition to this new reporting structure, you found all the information helpful and helped contextualize the results you're looking at and hopefully getting some insight into the businesses as we move through the transformation.
So thank you for joining the call, and we'll talk to you again in July.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. Let me start by saying we’re pleased with the progress we made again this quarter. We delivered revenue of $22.1 billion, operating net income of $4.7 billion, and operating earnings per share of $4.84. As we get in to our results, you’ll see that our fourth quarter and full year performance reflects the transitions in our business as we address the significant shifts in our industry, as well as some of the cyclical challenges of the global business environment.
So as always in January, I’ll start out with some comments on the year, show you the progress we’ve made in our transformation, discuss the details of the quarter, and then wrap up with our view of 2016. For the full year, we delivered nearly $82 billion of revenue, and $14.7 billion of operating net income and our operating earnings per share were $14.92. As we’ve said, this transformation will play out over time, and with revenue down 1%, for the second consecutive year we’ve had modest improvement in our year-to-year revenue performance, excluding the impact of currency and divestitures. I’ll comment on year-to-year revenue performance on this basis throughout.
Our strategic imperatives continued strong performance, up 26% for the year. This now represents 35% of IBM’s revenue. Our profit and margin reflect our portfolio actions as we shift to higher value, as well as the level of investments we’re making to drive our transformation. We generated over $13 billion of free cash flow, which is up year-to-year. This is 98% of our GAAP net income, in line with our expectation that free cash flow realization will be in the 90s.
A couple of years ago, we laid out our strategic imperatives around big data and analytics, around cloud, and around mobile and security, the areas where our clients are looking to us to help move them to the future. I want to spend a minute on the progress we’ve made since then in shifting our business toward these strategic imperatives, and in the investments we’ve been making, which aren’t yet reflected in our revenue streams. We have said, we expect these strategic imperatives to deliver double-digit revenue growth, and in 2015, our performance in our strategic imperatives accelerated.
Together, cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security grew 26% and delivered $29 billion in revenue. As I mentioned they now represent 35% of IBM, which is up from 22% two years ago. With 57% revenue growth over the last year, cloud is now a $10 billion business for us. This made us the largest cloud provider in 2015, which is what you’d expect, given our extensive relationships in enterprise IT and incumbency in the data center, positioning us to help our clients implement hybrid cloud environments.
Revenue from our as-a-Service offerings increased about 60% to $4.5 billion for the year, and we exited 2015 with an annual run rate for our as-a-Service business of $5.3 billion. The $10 billion also includes $5.6 billion of revenue from our foundational offerings where we provide software, hardware and services so clients can build their own clouds. In either case, what we’ve been saying for some time is that clients are utilizing a cloud not just to reduce costs, but to gain agility and enable innovation. And whether they’re consuming as-a-Service, or through their own clouds or as in the case of most enterprise clients who are implementing a hybrid environment, we’re leading that move.
To address opportunities we see in this space, in 2015 we made seven cloud acquisitions including Cleversafe for object storage, Gravitant for cloud brokerage services, and Clearleap for cloud video services. We also invested nearly a billion dollars in capital expanding our global cloud data center footprint to 46. We already have an ecosystem of millions of developers globally, and our Bluemix Platform-as-a-Service has already expanded to over a million users, adding 15,000 developers a week.
With nearly $18 billion of analytics revenue, we’re also the largest analytics provider, and we’ll extend that lead by moving into new areas including Watson Health and Watson Internet of Things. In Watson Health, we are integrating our own organic capabilities with content acquired through Merge, Phytel, and Explorys. Healthcare is a new revenue and profit opportunity for us as we change the face of healthcare through our cognitive platform to provide value to providers, payers, and partners. We’re also addressing the IoT market.
Our Weather Company acquisition not only gives us tremendously valuable data and digital content, but a high volume, cloud-based, insight-driven platform that we’ll integrate with Watson to address significant new opportunity spaces. We’ll talk about how we’re addressing these opportunities at our investor briefing at the end of February. And while we are investing in capabilities for the future, we’re also returning significant value to shareholders. We paid out nearly $5 billion in dividends, and we reduced our average share count by 2.7%.
So we got a lot done in 2015. To sum it up, our revenue for the year was down 1%, we expanded gross margin, we invested heavily for the future, and we returned capital to shareholders, all while transforming the business. The progress we’re making gives us confidence that we’re on the right strategy, and the actions we’ve taken not only advance our transformation, but also will contribute to our growth rate in the future. I’ll come back to the full year, and 2016 after going through the details of the quarter starting with the financial metrics.
Our revenue for the quarter of $22.1 billion was down 2%, reflecting the transition we’ve been describing. I’ll spend just a minute on currency, which continues to be a headwind. Currency impacted our reported revenue by over 6 points or $1.5 billion, which is about $350 million more than the spot rates suggested 90 days ago. For the year, currency translation reduced our revenue by over $7 billion. That by itself is the revenue of a Fortune 500 company and currency was also a headwind to our profit performance. We estimate it impacted our profit growth by about $300 million in the fourth quarter and over $1 billion for the year. At current spot rates, we would expect a significant impact to revenue and profit again in 2016 not just from the translation, but from the year-to-year cash flow hedging dynamics. I’ll come back to this.
Our margin performance reflects some ongoing dynamics in the business, like higher levels of investment, and an impact from the mix of contracts and resource shifts in our services business. But it also reflects some unique items in the fourth quarter of last year, the largest of which was $1.4 billion gain from the sale of our x86 server business. This prior period gain represents effectively all of the year-to-year decline in PTI margin. I’ll talk more about the margin drivers in the segment discussions.
Our underlying effective tax rate was 20%, and this quarter the rate also reflects the recent U.S. tax legislation, and the settlement of our U.S. tax audit, which we have talked about throughout 2015. And so bottom line, we delivered $4.84 of operating earnings per share. We generated over $6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and $13 billion for the year, and as I mentioned, this is 98% of GAAP net income. We returned about three quarters of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2015 through dividends and gross share repurchases.
Now turning to the revenue by geography, we had good performance across many of the major markets. Europe returned to growth, led by continued growth in Germany, France, and the UK. In fact, Germany posted double-digit growth and in December, we announced Munich as the headquarters for our new Watson IoT business, as well as our first European Watson innovation center. In Asia Pacific, Japan continued to post growth, led by services.
In the AP growth markets, we had double-digit growth in India and Australia though China declined. Our U.S. revenue was down. We had strong growth in the U.S. in all hardware platforms – zSystems, Power, and storage, but it was offset by weak services and transactional software performance. The growth markets in total were down 4%, roughly in line with the last two quarters, and from a regional perspective, growth in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa was offset by declines in Asia Pacific.
Turning to the segment perspective, our total revenue was down 2%, and gross margin declined about a point. Our Global Technology Services revenue grew, as we help our clients transition to a hybrid cloud services platform bringing in more cloud, mobility and security to infrastructure services. This contributed to our backlog growth for the year. Our GTS gross margin decline is driven by investments in cloud data centers and the ramp of new contracts, which generally have lower up-front margins.
In Global Business Services, we’re adding resources and growing quickly in strategic areas, while transitioning away from some of the more traditional areas. This shift of resources impacts productivity in the near-term, which puts pressure on margin. In Software, our annuity content grew, but transactional performance has been impacted by the flexibility we’ve been providing in ELAs with our larger clients. The transactional performance in the fourth quarter was consistent with what we saw in September. But a larger transactional mix in the fourth quarter drove a deceleration in the overall software growth rate.
Our Systems Hardware revenue was up, driven by zSystems and Power. This caps a very strong year in our Systems business, reflecting that our leading edge servers run the most contemporary workloads. The Systems margin is driven by the lower mainframe margin, as is typical at this point in the cycle.
Turning to expense, our Operating Expense and Other Income is up 9%. There a few large items that impacted the growth rate this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the sale of our System X business in the fourth quarter of last year, resulting in a gain of $1.4 billion in that period. And this quarter we took a charge of about $85 million for the write-down of the equity component received as consideration.
So together, these were $1.5 billion year-to-year impact to our expense. We also had a year-to-year reduction in workforce rebalancing. We had $580 million of workforce rebalancing charges in the fourth quarter of last year, with essentially none this year, so this reduced expense growth by 10 points. And currency reduced expense growth by 8 points. Between the translation of non-dollar spending, and the cash flow hedging gains that are reported in other income and SG&A. This is pretty consistent with what we’ve seen all year.
Outside of these larger items, our expense dynamics have been consistent throughout the year. We’re accelerating shifts within our operational expense base driving productivity and efficiency in some areas, while increasing investment in support of our strategic imperatives. This year, we shifted $5 billion of spend to our strategic imperatives, that’s across cost, expense and capital expenditures.
Now let’s turn to the segments, and we’ll start with services. We ended the fourth quarter with a services backlog of $121 billion, which grew for the third consecutive quarter. We continue to see momentum in our services offerings that modernize our clients IT systems and move their operations into the cloud-based mobile world. We’ve seen reports that suggest the adoption of cloud it means shrinking deal sizes, but this is not what we are seeing. Clients are looking to transform their most critical systems into hybrid cloud environments, and the complexity of these partnerships in many cases results in larger engagements. 
In fact, this quarter we have signed 26 services deals greater than a $100 million, and for the full year we signed over 70 of these substantial transactions, which is 40% more than last year. So with a growing backlog and a 40% increase in large deals during the year, we are not seeing shrinking deals. Now about 70% of those transactions feature hybrid cloud content, which reflects both the value our clients see in hybrid, and the reality that not all of their workloads will be optimized for the cloud. 
Just recently, we signed a $1.4 billion expansion in the scope of our relationship with European Bank BNP Paribas. This is a joint GBS and GTS engagement, and as part of the agreement, we'll operate two of the bank's data centers in Belgium as hybrid cloud centers, providing cloud infrastructure and a full suite of business transformation services spanning applications testing, business intelligence, security and core banking solutions.
Global Technology Services delivered $8.1 billion of revenue, and grew for the third consecutive quarter. 
Our strategic imperatives including our hybrid cloud services in GTS grew strong double digits this quarter, and for the full year. This includes strong demand for Softlayer, which again grew double digits this quarter. This Infrastructure-as-a- Service cloud platform provides our clients with a full range of cloud services including virtual and bare metal servers along with a dedicated dark fiber network infrastructure. As clients evaluate their technology roadmap, they are looking for agility and innovation and to gain insight into data from all sources. 
Our hybrid cloud stack is an open platform that enables this innovation. Our clients can choose from public, private, and dedicated environments based on their needs, such as workload, performance, data sovereignty, and regulatory requirements. Entire industries and value chains are being disrupted, and our clients are looking to us for competitive advantage.
To expand our Cloud capabilities, this past quarter we announced the acquisition of Gravitant. Gravitant develops cloud-based software to enable organizations to easily broker software and computing services across multiple suppliers and cloud environments from a single screen.
We also announced the acquisition of Clearleap, a premier provider of cloud-based video services. This will provide our enterprises with a fast and easy way to securely manage, monetize, and grow user video experiences. The Clearleap video platform is optimized for massive scalability, which enables clients to ramp up and support millions of concurrent users within seconds to support special events. The innovations have attracted leading brands such as HBO, A&E Networks, the NFL, and Sony Movie Channel.
Finally, our maintenance business continues to contribute significant revenue and profit by delivering a wide range of support services to maintain and improve our clients’ IT infrastructure. We continue to see strong demand for our Multi-Vendor Support services where clients can leverage our global distribution and inventory capabilities.
Our GTS PTI margin is up about two points year to year. This was driven by lower workforce rebalancing charges and savings from actions taken throughout the year to drive efficiency in our delivery model. Mitigating these savings, we continue to invest to contemporize our clients IT systems, transforming them into digital enterprises. We’re scaling our Softlayer footprint with 46 cloud data centers opened around the world. 
Finally, as we’ve talked about throughout the year, currency is impacting margin, and remains the largest impact on year-to-year profit growth given the strong dollar environment. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.3 billion in the quarter. We continue to transform our GBS business, and our signings were up double digits this quarter driven by our digital offerings. Revenue from our strategic imperative practices was again up strong double digits. 
Our analytics practice grew over 20%, our cloud services were up over 60%, and our mobile practice more than doubled. Our revenue continues to be impacted by the wind down of traditional enterprise application implementations. Clients are moving away from ERP engagements to initiatives that focus on digitizing their business with analytics, cloud, and mobile technologies.
In December we announced that as part of our partnership with Apple, we’ve now delivered over 100 MobileFirst for iOS applications. This unique partnership brings together the simplicity of design and ease of use of the Apple mobile device, with our ability to build applications that scale securely and efficiently to the enterprise helping to transform the way work gets done across 14 industries and 65 professions. These apps allow our clients to securely access their most critical data and processes, so that they can redesign workflows and drive productivity. Since we announced the partnership with Apple, we’ve generated over $1 billion in signings from the program.
GBS profit margin was flat year to year. Let me talk about some of the dynamics within that. We have a benefit from lower workforce rebalancing charges. In parts of the portfolio where the market is declining, we are seeing price and profit pressure and we are taking actions to optimize our cost structure. We continue to invest in our analytics, cloud, and mobility practices. 
We’ve hired and shifted significant resources to these areas, which impacts productivity and margin in the near term. We are also scaling a new cognitive consulting practice launched last quarter that is focused on helping our clients unlock the transformative value of cognitive business.
Our Software revenue was $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter. Our annuity content grew year to year, while transactional content declined. Our Software profit performance continues to reflect the revenue trajectory, a higher level of investments in areas like Watson, Watson Health, IoT and Bluemix, and an impact from currency translation
Let me spend a minute on the revenue dynamics. Looking at the transactional content, recalling our last earnings call, we talked about weaker transactional performance at the end of September, which impacted the third quarter. Our fourth quarter transactional performance was very similar to what we experienced in September. Given the much higher transactional mix in the fourth quarter, this had a larger impact on our total software performance, resulting in a deceleration in software growth in the fourth. 
Looking ahead to first quarter, which has a lower transactional mix, we will see an improvement in our revenue trajectory. We’ve said in the past that our performance reflects that many of our large clients with multi-year contracts are utilizing the flexibility on deployment of their software, as they build out their environments with our broad portfolio, and this is continuing. Outside of our top 250 clients our software revenue was up low single digits in the fourth quarter, and for the full year.
On an annual basis, about 70% of our software business is annuity-like, including Software-as-a-Service, and subscription and support. Our renewal rates are steady, our SaaS business is growing, and our overall annuity revenue grew in the fourth quarter and the full year.
Middleware serves the purpose of integrating different environments – on prem, and cloud. To enable hybrid environments, our key capabilities have now been delivered on Softlayer, or as part of our IBM Bluemix platform. IBM’s middleware remains the number one integration platform in the world, and now integrates across cloud environments. 
To put it simply, this allows clients’ existing apps to access the cloud, and new “born on the cloud” applications to access clients’ existing assets. To accelerate the integration of middleware in a hybrid cloud environment, we made an organizational change at the beginning of this year, moving a portion of our middleware business into our cloud business, reflecting the importance of our middleware in the hybrid cloud marketplace.
We are also adding substantial new capabilities into our software and solutions portfolio. One example is the Weather Company acquisition, which will provide the basis for our IoT platform. This acquisition brings with it a high-volume platform that can ingest sensor data at scale. This platform can handle enormous complexity, taking in four billion weather forecasting points and 26 billion queries in its cloud service each day. This is the fourth most-used mobile app, handling seven times more transaction volume than the world’s leading search engine. Some of this has been running on our cloud already and of course we will move all of this to IBM cloud. 
And then we will layer in Watson to give it the cognitive capability to apply machine learning at scale. This then gives us the ability to expand this platform capability to industries beyond weather, like health. The power of the platform is its ability to use Watson cognitive capabilities to gather new insights by connecting data at scale from multiple industry domains.
Our Systems Hardware segment revenue was $2.4 billion. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in both z Systems and Power. We have continued to deliver innovation to our systems to enable them to run the most contemporary workloads. In fact, about half of our systems segment revenue in 2015 was to address analytics workloads, or hybrid and private clouds.
This quarter z Systems revenue was up more than 20%. Since the launch of z13 in the first quarter of 2015, we have delivered growth of 35%, with strong double-digit growth in every quarter since the launch. z13 was contemporized for the workloads around mobile, hybrid cloud and analytics, which continues to resonate well with our existing customers, and bringing new customers to the platform. For the year we added 50 new clients across 25 countries.
Power revenue grew 8%, which is the strongest performance of the year. In Power we are serving a high value market, while adding capabilities and finding new economic models to grow over time. Unix is a declining market, but we continue to address it because it is very a high value space. At the same time, we introduced low-end Linux-based Power systems to capture the growing Linux market, and are building an IP stream through the OpenPOWER ecosystem. Even though the Unix market is declining, by delivering innovation and repositioning the platform, our Power systems have grown four quarters in a row. This is a good example of how we transform ourselves.
The growth in our servers was mitigated by a 7% decline in Storage hardware, which continues to be impacted by weakness in traditional disk and tape. As we have said, value in the storage market continues to shift to software and offering requirements that are driving demand for flash and object-based storage. We are well-positioned in these new areas, with growth in flash, and our recent acquisition of Cleversafe.
Looking back at 2015, our Systems results reflect a successful transformation and repositioning of the business. Revenue was up 8% for the year, and profit up about $600 million. This performance reflects our solid mainframe product cycle and the successful Power transformation, with Power revenue growing for the first time since 2011.
So moving on to cash flow, in the quarter, we generated $7.1 billion of cash from operations, excluding our financing receivables. We invested $1 billion dollars in CapEx, and generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow.
For the full year, we generated $17 billion of cash from operations. We invested almost $4 billion in CapEx this year, with a significant amount going to support our growing services backlog, and for cloud as we build out cloud data centers. And so we generated free cash flow of $13.1 billion, an improvement of almost $700 million year to year. The primary driver of this improvement was lower cash tax payments of about $3 billion. 
Our cash and tax book rates for 2015 were fairly consistent, and so the year-to-year benefit to cash flow was driven by a much higher cash tax rate in 2014. We also had over a $1 billion of improvement in our sales cycle working capital. This was partially offset by a decline in our profit performance, and payments of performance-based compensation.
Looking at uses of cash, we’ve invested over $3 billion on acquisitions this year. We’ve acquired 14 companies, including seven in the fourth quarter. The Weather Company acquisition I mentioned earlier will close in the first half of 2016.
Over the course of the year we’ve returned $9.5 billion to shareholders including dividends of nearly $5 billion and $4.6 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back 30 million shares, reducing our average share count by 2.7%. At the end of the year, we had $5.6 billion remaining in our buy back authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.2 billion. Total debt was nearly $40 billion, of which $27 billion was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains just over seven to one. The credit quality of our financing receivables remains strong at 55% investment grade; you can see this in our supplemental charts. The year-to-year reduction in investment grade was driven by rating changes to our existing portfolio, not by changing our approach to the market.
Our non-financing debt of $12.7 billion was almost a $1 billion lower than September, and up just over $1 billion year-to-year. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was 54%, four points lower than September, and five points lower than a year ago. Our debt-to-cap ratio was impacted again this year by a reduction in equity due to currency translation, and pension re-measurement. Together, these impacted our equity by about $3.5 billion. The performance of our retirement-related assets, and return and discount rate assumptions at year-end are in our supplemental charts. You can see our funding levels remain solid with the U.S. and worldwide tax-qualified plans at 101% and 97% respectively. And importantly, our balance sheet continues to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term.
So now let me wrap up where I started the call by saying that we’re pleased with the progress that we made again this year in the transformation of our business. We’re continuing to invest and add capabilities to drive the transformation. In 2015, we spent over 6% of our revenue in R&D, we invested about $4 billion in capital, and over $3 billion to acquire 14 companies. We are integrating acquired content with our organic capabilities, and leveraging partnerships and a broader ecosystem to build new high value platforms. And we’re applying our cognitive capabilities to more of what we do.
Within our spend, we’re shifting to key opportunity areas, and we’re seeing the returns in our strategic imperatives results. With $29 billion of revenue, these now make up 35% of IBM. In 2015, we had a successful mainframe cycle, and Power grew as we repositioned it to address a broader opportunity. Our services backlog was up and we exited the year with a $121 billion book of business. Our software annuity base, which is about 70% of our software revenue also continued to grow. Our overall Software performance reflects reduced transactional levels as our largest customers utilize flexibility we’ve provided and commit to our platform for the longer term.
The macro environment, as always, is mixed, and currency continues to be a significant headwind. While we are focused on remaining competitive in local markets, the translation impact is significant. It was an 8 point impact to revenue growth in 2015, and at current spot rates, currency would be another 2 to 3 point impact this year. The profit impact is substantial as well, and given the sustained period of dollar strengthening, the profit impact in 2016 will in fact be greater than 2015, both because of the translation impact, and the roll-off effect of cash flow hedging gains. At current spot rates, we expect currency to impact pre-tax profit growth in 2016 by about $1.3 billion with nearly three quarters of that coming from a year-to-year reduction in cash flow hedging gains.
So now as we look forward to 2016, we’ll continue to deliver strong growth in our strategic imperatives. We expect some modest expansion in gross margin, and will continue to invest at high levels. And we’ll continue to return value to shareholders,
through share repurchases and dividends.
Taking all of this into consideration, we expect Operating EPS of at least $13.50. This reflects an impact from currency of over a dollar of EPS, which is about a seven and a half point impact to the growth rate. Our free cash flow will follow our profit performance, and we continue to see our free cash flow realization in the nineties.
Looking at the quarterly skew, as you know the first quarter represents the smallest quarter in terms of contribution to our full year earnings. At this point in prior years our first quarter view has been from 14% of the full year to a few points higher than that. Given the magnitude of the currency headwind and the skew of our investments this year, we would expect the first quarter of 2016 to come in at about 15% of the $13.50.
Bottom line, we remain confident in our strategy, and in our ability to execute. And we look forward to continued progress in our transformation in 2016.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and year. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.
Operator, let’s please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we will begin to question-and-answer session of the conference.[Operator Instructions] First question is from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Sir, you may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes, good afternoon, Martin. When you began 2015 you talked about software as really being kind of the pivot for whether you might hit the high end of your guidance range to the low end of your guidance range. And you anticipated or hoped that software would improve in the second half. What we saw was the opposite is that software decelerated significantly in the second half of this year. And I’m wondering, if you could reflect on: A) what happened and B) while there should be some improvement next quarter because of less transaction and I gather the weather channel will be added into that division.
How do we think about software in 2016, should we be expecting a business that’s down low single-digit at constant currency again? And perhaps you can talk about kind of the forces that play both again what happened in terms of deterioration in the second half and how we should think about the forces that play in 2016? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure thank you, thanks Toni. A few comments on software, so as we said in our prepared remarks, the deceleration third to fourth really was driven by this – by the mix shift and the continuation of the transaction closing rates that we saw in September. So we talked about – coming out of September we talked about a slower rate of closing in some of our larger deals and that’s what we experienced as well in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, because of the mix shift alone we see an improvement and as you point out the weather company another acquisitions by the way to the extent that they are – have software in them they will obviously bolster that growth rate.
A few things, I think are important to note within software. First, as we said in our prepared remarks and the phenomena is really no different in the fourth and what we’ve seen all year, our annuity business within the software business. So that’s about 70% of our overall software stream. Our annuity business continues to grow. So that has a service in it, it has our subscription and support business in it as well, so that continues to grow.
And then outside of our largest clients and this is a phenomena that we’ve been talking about, outside of our largest clients where they don’t have as broad access to our software portfolio, we continue to see growth as well, both transactionally and they’re obviously part of the asset service stream. Within the large clients as I mentioned earlier and as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we provide flexibility, it gives them – it gives our clients an ability now to manage their projects and they deploy maybe differently than they anticipated at the beginning of the year. From my discussions with our clients, a lot of that depends on the visibility they have both of their demand patterns and the visibility they have to sort of the – kinds of projects they might have to implement in the near-term.
So I don’t think that’s any different than what we’ve experienced in the past. I would say that one of the things we look at closely, particularly with regard to the usage of our software and how it’s getting deployed, is our ability to maintain these renewal rates on our subscription and support. And our renewal rates around the world remain very high in the mid-90s globally. And if we look in the U.S. where we had a weaker software transactional performance, actually our renewal rates in the U.S. are even higher than that, they are higher than they are in Japan, they are higher than they are in Europe, they are higher than they are in Australia. So our renewal rates continue in a very good track and that suggests that our annuity business within software has some good growth prospects.
But as we said in our prepared remarks again, just from the mix benefit of having more of that annuity mix in the first quarter, we will see an improvement. And then as you noted the acquisitions will sit on top of that.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. We can go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Katy, you may ask your question.
Katy Huberty
On a high note in servers both mainframe and power, how are you thinking about growth rates in 2016 as you move into the latter half of the cycle and how might that influence gross margins? It looks like it had an intact to the fourth quarter? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Your question actually cut off a little bit. I think you said, finishing at a high note in the fourth quarter, I’m going to assume that was the question, Katy. So, I’ll answer for mainframe and for power and how we’re entering 2016.
So first on mainframe, another very good cycle in mainframe, so as you know we announced that in the first quarter, the growth rates have been pretty consistent throughout, that we doubled in the first, growth in the second, good third quarter, again fourth quarter we finished at about 20% year-to-year of constant currency. And the adoption rates are consistent with what we would expect.
So for the full year the mainframe is up 35%. And as is typical in the mainframe cycle, margins in the announcement year tend to be a little bit lower. And we will see margin improvement as we get to the latter half of the – or the latter part of the mainframe cycle in 2016. From a power perspective, well I’ll tell you, the power team has done a wonderful job of transforming a business. And I think it’s a really good example of how IBM transforms its businesses.
So since as we put in the prepared remarks we have not grown since 2011 and in 2015, we grew each of the four quarters in the power business, finishing the fourth at plus eight. And I think what’s underpins that and what’s important to note is we continue to serve a decline in market for part of that Power business, the UNIX market is declining, it has been declining, but it’s still high value and it’s still serves a very important role in our clients environment and does some other most important works. So it – continues to be an important market place.
But at the same time, the team has been able to reinvent the platform, make it relevant in the Linux space so we’re seeing very good Linux placements in Power and the applicability of that POWER8 platform in Cloud spaces for instance and running other ERP type missions has been a terrific boost to the overall growth rates.
And then keep in mind that we’ve also – the team is also put in play from a business model perspective, the OpenPOWER Foundation, which is an intellectual property play. So that will also boost margins. So the Power, again the Power team has done a terrific job of repositioning a product which had a very strong acceptance and that’s delivering high value in a declining market space into now a business that has grown four quarters in a row with a lot of leverage from here as our OpenPower consortium members start to deliver their own systems into that Linux space.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy. Rovena, can we go to the next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.
Tien-tsin Huang
Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask on services if we can expect some improvement in growth in 2015 given the backlog chime you talked about that Martin. And also your confidence in services margin, expansion in 2016, because, if I heard correctly, no workforces were down saying in the fourth quarter. Is that a signal that you’re on a good place with your offshore delivery right-sizing? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Thanks Tien-tsin. So a couple of comments and I’ll disaggregate, I guess I’ll talk about GTS and GBS separately. So first, we did, as we said in our prepared remarks, we finished with a very good backlog growth of 1% ex-currency. Now that is $121 billion book of business. So even, 1% growth is a lot of additional business that we feel quite good about the backlog, we’re entering with – and even when we look at the signings progress throughout the year, for the full year GTS, global technology services grew signings and GBS grew signings and in fact GBS exited fourth quarter with double-digit signings growth in the quarter. So a very strong return to growth which put them into growth for the year, so from a backlog perspective and from a relevance of our offerings perspective, I think those signings numbers suggest that there are substantial deals out there, there are deals that play well to – our high value view and our ability to move our clients into hybrid environment and our ability to continue to grow – to continue to grow that backlog.
From a margin perspective in GTS, keep in mind that at a total GTS level we have very good margins. But we also have a maintenance business in there which has a lot of margin within it. When you pull out the maintenance margin and just look at DSO business, we still see opportunities to expand margins in that area. And keep in mind, with regard to workforce rebalancing while we didn't have a charge in the fourth. We’ll continue to remix our skills and we'll continue to move our work to where global delivery centers can best do it. So that will not be a year-to-year impact in the first quarter. But we will continue to remix skills and so as we bring on new contractors as an example and we've seen a lot of contract growth in Europe, we've seen a lot of contract growth in Asia. We will have an opportunity, we do have an opportunity to continue to expand our margins as we globalize some of that work.
Our movement of work into global delivery centers, it varies by geography and quite frankly its varies by country. In the U.S. we were in pretty good – we are in a pretty good spot here but where we sign new contracts obviously we take on a lot of people and we've got to figure out how do we optimize those delivery platforms. And then in GTS as we've talked about we continue to work our way through a transformation towards higher value and what we see from the margin perspective is that the work we're doing to digitize our clients front office the work we're doing to provide a cognitive solution to our clients which is just starting now to roll into our consulting results.
That is all high margin and we see a lot of opportunity continue to generate those kinds of margins. In the work we're transitioning out of, that is pretty price competitive and then and so we're seeing declining margins but more importantly as we shift the resources and as we move those skills there is a productivity hit to the overall business. So we're not relying on a dramatic net back if you will and our GBS margins going into the year but we do see a very good opportunity on the other side as we finish that transition.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tien-tsin. Let's go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Brian White from Drexel. Sir, you may ask your question.
Brian White
Yes, Martin, if we look at the different business segments in 2016, what businesses do you think have an opportunity to actually grow in constant currency and what businesses have an opportunity to expand margins in 2016? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Brian thanks. So a few comments, I think what we're going to see in 2016 is really the phenomena that we’ve been talking about now for a couple of years which is our clients are investing heavily in these growing areas of cloud of analytics, of mobile, social and security and as you saw in the full year of 2015, we grew that 26%, right now it’s 35% of our business. So our client discussions today are still built around those that shift into those parts of the business.
We’ll also see a continued discussion around parts of a business where they’re focused on us delivering productivity to them, now productivity to your clients means reduced revenues for us, but that’s the phenomena we’ve been in. And so when we look at 2016, I think we'll see a continuation of both of those. As you know in 2015, we ended the year with a revenue base it was about 1% smaller than it was the prior year given those two dynamics strong growth in the strategic imperatives and delivering productivity to our clients in the rest.
So that probably – that trend is what we’re going to see now the mix obviously be different the strategic imperatives are representing a larger part of the business than they did in then where they started in 2015, but that trend will continue. On a segment-by-segment basis, GTS has grown now three quarters of the year and as I said with pretty good backlog growth and we think that trajectory continues to hold.
GBS improved in the fourth, relative to the third, so a sequential improvement in its year-to-year growth rate. But we’re not relying on that bouncing back rapidly as we know we’re going through a transition there, and we want to get through that transition as rapidly as possible. But having said that, about half of their business now is in strategic imperatives, but half isn’t so we’re going to continue that transition.
The systems business will continue to see momentum as I mentioned in the power business where the team has done a terrific job of repositioning the platform. But the mainframe is coming into the back half of the cycle and so we won’t see the same growth levels that we saw. And then software as I mentioned in response to the prior question that transactional mix will not play as bigger role in the first quarter as it did in the fourth and so obviously we’ll see how we transition through the year, but bolstering that software growth will also be some of the acquisitions.
So I think there are discussions with our clients, as I started with the discussions with our clients are going to reflect these two halves of our business which is discussions around moving to the future and the other discussion are helping them drive productivity.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Brian. Rovena, can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Sure, Ma’am. Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Sir, you may ask your question
Steve Milunovich
Great, thank you. Could you talk a bit about free cash flow you said free cash flow will follow profit. Does that literally mean you expect about $13.50 in free cash flow per share? I would think maybe not given that you had a $3 billion positive swing on the cash taxes and maybe you could go through cash taxes, pension, working capital, CapEx, some of the swing factors and where you think that I’ll come out on free cash flow this year.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Steve, and you’re right. We – what my reported remarks or my remarks we’re not intended to say, we’re going to do $13.50 in free cash flow per share. That was not the intent. But what I – we do want to say is that our free cash flow performance in absolute terms will follow the profit performance. So a few comments, first we did have a year-to-year reduction in our cash taxes. But keep in mind that in 2015 our cash tax rate and our book rate were pretty similar.
And so the relationship you see in 2015 is the right relationship, yes, year-to-year there was a benefit, but that’s because we had a very high cash tax rate in 2014. So the 2015 relationship, which we – where we produced 98% of our debt net income was the realization per free cash flow is the one we’re talking about for 2016 as well we see that relationship. Now within that – the guidance that $13.50 – at least $13.50 we translate the free cash flow kind of in the $11 billion to $12 billion range.
And within that we have assumed some growth in CapEx for the year, as we continue to drive our cloud platform and our investments in there and our system, our services business. The operational performance that’s embedded within that obviously will have an impact. Then the rest and I’ll give you a few pluses and minuses here. The rest kind of translates to basically flat. So really is the profit performance. So we’ll have slightly higher income tax payments as an example.
We’ll have a less – a little bit of a less benefit of working capital. We have slightly lower pension payments, we have slightly lower workforce rebalancing payments assume. So you put all that together and what I meant by free cash flow will follow profit is that free cash flow at $11 billion to $12 billion of free cash flow roughly translates to what we see in profit performance at that at least number.
Bear in mind that, as we talked about on profit. There’s about $1.3 billion impact of profit year-to-year from currency. And while the dynamics are a little bit different in cash flow that does translate roughly to the impact to free cash flow as well. So what you’re seeing in here in our guidance, which was a big impact from currency, is also a big impact in free cash flow for next year.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Steve. Rovena, can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Grossman from Stifel Financial. You may ask your question sir.
David Grossman
Thank you. So Martin, if I read the press release right, it said the strategic imperatives decelerated through about 16% growth year-over-year at constant currency. That’s obviously down from where you were in the first three quarters. What were the primary components driving the deceleration? And what would be a reasonable target for growth in those strategic imperatives in 2016?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks, David. So a couple of things, as we said for the year we were at – we had very good growth of $29 billion. What we saw in the quarter was about $1.7 billion sequential increase in strategic imperative revenue. And that’s better than it was first to second, better than second to third. So we did see kind of a typical seasonal sequential improvement in our strategic imperatives from third to fourth. When we talk about our strategic imperatives at Investor Day, we said they’ve been growing kind of in this uncanny rate of 18, 18, 19, 19, 19 very steady over the last few years. And we said that our model assumes that we will transition to those areas at a similar kind of rates, I think we had 15 to 19, think of it as high-teens if you will.
As we went through this year and as we said at the beginning, first quarter we printed over 30, and as we said we’re not relying on that throughout the year. So we finished the year on a full-year basis, now relative to that 15 to 19 range, where we finished at 26% growth year-to-year. So we’re ahead of what we expected. We’re transitioning into those areas faster than we had expected back at Investor Day. And so we finished at 35% of the revenue streams. And again in Investor Day, we said by 2018 we get to about 40 or at least 40.
We think we’re in good shape to make it there, but 26, we’re pleased with, because we’re transitioning faster than we have over the last four years or five years. And again, it’s on a higher base. So we’re pleased with the progress we’re making and continuing to grow these strategic imperatives.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Can we go to next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
Martin Schroeter
Jim, we can’t hear you if you are on mute.
James Schneider
Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me now?
Martin Schroeter
Yes.
Patricia Murphy
We can.
James Schneider
Okay, sorry. Just in terms of the software performance during the quarter, can you maybe talk about the impact and quantify the impact you saw from the ELA, because there is no weakness in Q4. And then can you maybe give us some kind of bracketing for 2016 about what impact you expect from ELAs to the extent you can see it going forward over the next couple of quarters?
Martin Schroeter
Well, sure, Jim. So a few things, one, and I’m not saying you implied this, but ELAs are very – ELAs are Enterprise License Agreements for all of our listeners. ELAs, Enterprise License Agreements are very powerful – a very powerful way for our clients to consume our software, gives them broad access to the portfolio we offer like our middleware platform, which is quite valuable to them as they think about their hybrid cloud environment.
So we do more ELAs, more Enterprise License Agreements, we did more in 2015 and we did in 2014. We haven’t seen a dramatic change in the length of time our clients commit to the platform for those. As I mentioned on an earlier question, our renewal rates for the subscription and support that underpins their deployment of those continues at very high rates.
So the ELA structure is one that we think is – and our client think as a terrific way to consume our portfolio. Now parts of our portfolio will continue to – will continue to be consumed on an EL basis – ELA basis. And as you saw us, maybe you saw us, earlier this year we moved parts of our middleware portfolio into our cloud business. That’s really a reflection of the importance our middleware places in these hybrid cloud environment. So some of that could get start to get consumed in different models from ELAs that – maybe they get consumed on a more individual basis, maybe they get consumed on an as-a-Service basis, but the ELA construct remains quite powerful.
As I noted earlier, the big difference we saw was in the breath of the access that some of our clients have and they – because they don’t have the visibility they need to their demand environment or because they don’t have visibility to the most immediate need they might have, they’ll move around the deployment of those licenses into different areas. But again with our renewal right staying high, we know that they are still consuming those. So the ELA construct quite powerful. It’s the right way I think for our clients to consume our software and the right way to give them flexibility to deploy it.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Jim. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia from CLSA. You may now ask your question.
Lou Miscioscia
Hey thanks. Hey, Martin, Lou here. So just sticking on the software, if you go back to the second half of 2014 when the flexible pricing started to hit software growth in a meaningful way and then obviously it hit it all through 2015, when are we going to get the grandfathering position where we can get half the flexible price in which – I know that when we talked about this before you’ve said that it was the right thing to do for the customer. But customers want everything for free and I assume you are not trying to move through an open source type of model. So I’m just wondering when we can get passed and what else you can do to try to get software growth in your most profitable area in the company?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Louis. So a couple of things that I’d say. First, this is the right thing to do to offer our clients flexibility as they try to get insights into their demand environments and as they try to deploy their projects. So it is absolutely the right thing to do. We felt that way when we started talking about, and I think it’s still the right thing to do.
Again, what’s important to us is that they commit to the platform, number one. Number two that they are actually deploying the software and we see that as I mentioned in our renewal rates where as long as our renewal rates are staying high we know they’re using our software. So all of that is good for the model. And in the long-term, we think that we will benefit from all this. Now, bolstering our software growth this year and our software performance this year will be some acquisitions we made, so those will certainly help as we go through the year, but this is – again, it’s the right thing to do for our clients.
And as we continue to move our software into a broader and broader ecosystem, we’ll continue to see growth in those clients that that don’t have access to so much, so that will continue. But from an overall perspective with the acquisitions, which will help a bit, and again our renewal rates staying high. Over the long-term, this is a terrific business for us.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks. We’ll go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Sir, you may ask your question.
Keith Bachman
Hi, many thanks. I also wanted to focus on the software area. I think on the last call you mentioned that Software-as-a-Service was a small part of your existing portfolio, I think around 5% of revenues. As you think about 2016, could you address how you see the growth of as-a-Service impacting your software both revenue growth and profitability? And more specifically, I don’t think we’ve gotten a specific answer on can you grow software in 2016 and will your margins be up down or flat? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Keith. So, a few things. So, our SaaS revenue overall as a percentage of our total software business is still fairly small percentage, but it is growing and is growing quite well and we are always releasing new SaaS and acquiring new SaaS opportunities. So we see continued very strong growth in our SaaS portfolio into 2016. Now, it’s small and so relative to the total, it’s not going to drive a ton at the top-line, but over the long-term this will be a good economic model for IBM.
Additionally, the new businesses we’re building have this strong SaaS component or as-a-Service component to them. So, Watson for instance is an as-a-Service offering. Our new Watson Health business has built heavily on an as-a-Service offerings. And other as well are moving into much more heavily weighted to our as-a-Service. So the as-a-Service fees, which is part of our overall as-a-Service exit run rate $5.3 billion has pretty good growth in it. In terms of profitability, we talked in our prepared remarks about continued margin expansion in 2016. And part of that quite frankly is going to be driven by additional volumes on our as-a-Service platform, that’s both Software-as-a-Service, infrastructure-as-a-service and our platform-as-a-service, our Bluemix property.
So we will see as those revenues climb, we will see profitability in fact margin expansion out of those – excuse me as-a-Service properties. Within SaaS specifically, our margins and software are quite high while the move into a SaaS model is not accretive to margins in software. It’s not a big impact and it is accretive to margins and total IBM because we don’t have a lot of these SaaS properties. So, in 2016, we see margin improvements across our as-a-Service properties. Margins within SaaS specifically are accretive to IBM and we see that continue in 2016.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thanks. Rovena, can we please take one last question?
Operator
Yes, ma’am. Thank you. Our last question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, you may ask your question.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks. Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess – Martin just in the strategic imperatives revenue stream that you guys have, you absolutely have a fair bit of scale over the margin right now, especially in Analytics and Cloud. Can you explain and talk about what do you think the margin and the free cash flow profile of the strategic imperatives assets is versus overall IBM, I think that would be helpful for people to understand? And then is the mix of strategic imperatives, software service and hardware change a whole lot from the last analyst have you guys talked about it?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Amit, a few things. I will answer the strategic imperative revenue part of your non-multipart question first. So on the strategic imperative revenue, I guess, the margin profile of that for the bulk of that business, which is focused on again Cloud or on our Analytics business, for a lot of that it just looks like our existing margin profile. So, where we’re selling our hardware, where we’re selling our software in for our clients to build an Analytic solution or for them to build their own Cloud then the margin profile looks like IBM’s.
And as you know IBM is a high margin solution company. For the as-a-Service component of that, the margins are a little bit lower than that. Now a lot of that is because we don’t yet have the scale that we’d like or is it’s that differently we’re investing very heavily in order to drive that platform into our clients’ environment. And so, we’ll see margin improvement as we go into 2016 as we add more scale or take advantage if you will of the investments we have made. So in total the strategic imperative revenue over time will not have a dramatically different margin profile than what we see today. Again, because most of it has what is our margin profile today and the rest will continue to improve margins as our investment rates or as our revenue growth rates meet up and the capacity meets up with the investment rates.
Relative to the mix, our software mix within our strategic imperatives is still at about twice as high as the rest, if you will, the rest of the business. So as you know in across services, hardware and software, if you look at the mix of those, the software piece in the strategic imperatives twice as high as what we see in the rest of the business. Now, it is down a little bit year-to-year as we in any given year or any given quarter, we have a different mix. We have certain programs that roll in, but it remains on – in total at about twice as high a mix as what we have in our core business. Thanks, Amit.
Martin Schroeter
So let me just wrap up the call with a couple of comments, first, and I think we have been clear about this. We manage our business for the long-term. And in 2015, we made a lot of progress, a lot of very good progress in transforming the IBM company. You see this not only in the growth rate in the strategic imperatives, but importantly you see it in the big steps we’ve taken to address some of these new opportunities. We had an opportunity last year to invest quite a bit of capital. We bought 14 companies. We will continue to be acquisitive.
So with the returns we’re seeing on our investments, we are more and more encouraged that the strategy is right and that we’re executing to transform IBM. In 2016, we’ll have our Investor Day in February. We’re going to talk more about both the transformation of IBM. We’re going to talk about how we present their information to the financial community to help understand IBM, particularly as we emerge as a cognitive solutions and Cloud platform company. I think it’s very important to understand what IBM is emerging as and again we’ll talk about that in our Investor Day.
So, thank you very much for joining the call today, and we’ll see you in February.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. For some time, we've been talking about the tremendous changes in our industry as our clients move to new areas, get great in value from their data and IT environments and implement new business models.
So as we transform our business, we invest where we see higher value over the longer term. We drive growth in the areas where we're investing, while other areas decline as we shift the business and we expect to expand margins in our move to higher value. This is how we transform from one era to the next.
Our third quarter results reflect the progress we're making in that transformation. We continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives. We expanded gross and net margins. We generated substantial free cash flow and we continue to high level of investment while returning value to shareholders.
We always said this would play out over time, though this quarter we fell a little short of the revenue expectations we set for ourselves. The GBS transformation is taking longer as the market shifts away from some of the more traditional application areas and our storage disc business was weaker as more of the demand moves to our flash.
And while our software performance for the quarter was consistent with what we seen all year we did have some weakness in transactions at the end of the quarter. In addition, our revenue trajectory continues to reflect significant impacts from currency movements in our divested businesses, in fact over 12 points of growth in total.
Put it altogether and the progress we're making demonstrates that we're on the right strategy as we help our clients move their businesses to the future. We see a lot of opportunity and with this momentum and strategic imperatives; we're going to continue to invest at a very high level to accelerate the shift in our business.
At the same time, we considered the pace of the GBS progress and applied the trajectory and transactions we saw at the end of the quarter to the larger fourth quarter transaction base which reduces our view of the year.
Taking all of this into consideration, we believe it is prudent to update our expectations for full year operating earnings per share to $14.75 to $15.75 while our view of free cash flow remains relatively flat year-to-year. I'll come back to this after going through the results of the quarter.
Let me start by providing a little more color on the strategic imperatives performance. Our revenue and cloud, analytics, social, mobile and security was up 27% in the third quarter which puts us up over 30% year-to-date. This is without the impact of currency and divestitures and throughout this presentation I'll focus on that view.
Our cloud revenue was up over 65% through three quarters with strong year-to-year performance across both our private foundations revenue and our as a service offerings. Over the last 12 months, our cloud revenue was $9.4 billion and we exited the third quarter with an annualize of service run rate of $4.5 billion.
Analytics revenue is up nearly 20% year-to-date and in the area of engagement, the revenue from these businesses nearly doubled over last year. Our security business was up 12%, social up about 40%, and our mobile business quadrupled.
Looking at the transformation or shift to strategic imperatives from a segment perspective, in Global Technology Services, we're bringing in more cloud, mobility and security to infrastructure services both to new clients and to help existing clients move to the future.
Our GTS results reflect growth in revenue and in the backlog. And when you look at high end servers, we've repositioned the portfolio and delivered innovation as these systems run the most contemporary workloads.
Throughout this year, we've had strong growth in our Z Systems and continued success in POWER. These are just two examples of what that shift looks like. We're continuing to invest and add capabilities to accelerate this shift. And in the last 90 days, we've committed more capital including the acquisitions of Merge Healthcare to give Watson the ability to see millions of medical images, along with Cleversafe, Compose, Strongloop and Meteorix, each bolstering our cloud capabilities.
We also just launched the industry's first consulting practice dedicated to cognitive business. These actions all advance our transformation of the IBM Company. Our approach is to integrate acquired content with our own organic capabilities and leverage partnerships and a broader ecosystem to build new high value platforms like Watson, SoftLayer, Bluemix and OpenPOWER.
Last quarter, I talked about the creation of Watson Health which incorporated our Watson capabilities, the acquisitions of Phytel and Explorys, partnerships with leading healthcare companies and creation of a compliant cloud.
We've continued to announce new partnerships and new cloud services. The acquisition of Merge Healthcare brings together Watson's advanced analytics and cognitive capabilities with data and images from Merge's medical imaging platform to help doctors make sense of one patient's medical images in the context of the massive related images.
We're creating similar platforms for other industries and areas such as internet-of-things. For example, we're working with a major global airline on how to apply cognitive thinking to understand all of the variables impacting fuel demands of any given flight.
They're looking a structured and unstructured data, included predicted taxi time, weather conditions, air traffic control delays, and in flight mechanical issues so as to optimize fuel load and we're working with the European Hospitality Company on how to apply cognitive thinking to understand how to maximize revenue from new high-end kiosk-based coffee shops.
They are looking at structured data such as frequency and timing of credit card purchases, combined with unstructured data including social chatter on Twitter and real-time weather.
They use Watson cognitive APIs to make sense of the data. This requires a platform approach that integrates industry expertise, analytic software, cognitive APIs, cloud, Bluemix, and multiple data streams, very powerful.
As I said earlier this is a longer term play. We're creating new platforms and building ecosystems and much of this is an as a service model. We're continuing to invest at a high level as we shift our spending to our strategic imperatives.
Let me now turn to the financial metrics for the quarter. Our revenue of $19.3 billion was down 1%, reflecting transition we've been describing. We expanded gross margin, driven by our portfolio actions and the relative strength of Z Systems' revenue, in other words driven by our shift to higher value.
As we said last quarter, our PTI trajectory in the third quarter would be similar to the second, reflecting continued high level of investments across the business and currency impacts and our PTI margin was flat year-to-year.
Our ongoing effective tax rate remains at 20% while the third quarter rate reflects discrete period items. And so bottom-line, we delivered $3.34 of operating earnings per share. We generated over $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and over the last 12 months, we've generated $13.6 billion of free cash flow with a realization of GAAP net income over 90%. Over that same period, we reduced our share count by 2% and increased our dividend returning about two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders.
Now turning to the revenue by geography. Our performance varied across the major markets. Our U.S. revenue was down 4%, a decline in traditional enterprise app implementations is impacting our consulting business and in the month of September, we had a slowdown in our software transactions.
That said, we did have another quarter of strong Z Systems performance in the you U.S. By contrast, two of our other largest countries, Japan and Germany posted the strongest growth. In fact this is the 12th consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan and this quarter, we had growth across services, software and hardware. We also had improved performance in the U.K., France, and Canada.
The growth markets in total were down 3%, a two point sequential improvement from last quarter. From a regional perspective, growth in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa was offset by declines in Asia-Pacific.
You'll recall last quarter I talked about the weakness in the BRICs which were down 18%. This quarter the BRICs were down 7% with sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance of all four countries.
Brazil was down 4% off a strong double-digit growth last year. Russia was also down at a single-digit rate. China was down 17% with fewer large transactions in the quarter and the bright spot, again, was India which grew for the third consecutive quarter. In fact this quarter, India was up double-digits leveraging growth in the services backlog and an improvement in the hardware business.
Turning to the segment perspective, our total revenue was down 1% and gross margin improved 80 basis points. Our Global Technology Services revenue grew and is now up in six of the last seven quarters as we deliver value to new clients and help existing clients move to the future.
In Global Business Services, we've been shifting resources and investing to drive growth in the strategic imperatives, the weakness in consulting specifically around enterprise apps is impacting our overall performance.
In our Systems business, as I mentioned we had strong performance in our Z Systems and POWER once again grew as we capture both the Unix and Linux opportunity. The hardware decline was driven by storage which continues to be a tough market.
Software revenue performance was consistent with what we've seen over the past year, with growth across our solution areas of security, analytics and social, offset by a headwind from operating systems and a decline in transactional revenue.
Our total margin improvement continues to be driven by a shift to higher value, primarily through portfolio actions and the relative strength of Z Systems, mitigated by investments and contract mix in our services business.
The reported operating expense and other income is down 12%. At this level of spend, our expense to revenue ratio was up 80 basis points. The expense dynamics have been very consistent all year. We're driving significant shifts within our large operational expense base driving productivity and efficiency in some areas while increasing investment in support of our strategic imperatives.
You'll recall that at the beginning of the year, we said we would shift an incremental $4 billion of spend across cost, expense, and capital expenditures to our strategic imperatives and we're on track to do that.
The reported decline in expense this quarter is again driven by currency and the divestiture of system x. We also had a higher level of workforce rebalancing and lower amount of performance based compensation.
Nine points of the decline was driven by currency between the translation of non-dollar spending and hedging gains that are reported in other income and SG&A. Two points of the decline are due to the fact that we no longer have the expense of the system x business in our run rate.
We'll wrap on this in the fourth quarter, but recall we did have a gain associated with that transaction in the fourth quarter of last year and in the third quarter, we took a charge for workforce rebalancing with essentially no activity last year this was up nearly $100 million year-to-year contributing two points to expense growth.
Now, let's turn to the segments and we'll start with services. Global Technology Services delivered $7.9 billion of revenue which is up 1%. Our outsourcing business is based on long-term partnerships, where our clients entrust us with the most important elements of their business and look to us to deliver innovation to help them transform their enterprises.
We've been reinventing our portfolio, providing the most modern IT services that connect our clients to the cloud-based mobile world and it's showing up in the business we're signing.
For example, we recently signed a 10-year, $700 million agreement with Abu Dhabi based Etihad Airways to deliver a range of efficient technology allowing the airline and its equity partners to transition their IT infrastructure into a globally integrated hybrid cloud-based platform.
Etihad Airways will use IBM's mobile solutions developed under the Apple-IBM alliance to provide enhanced mobile capabilities to its employees and guests. The agreement also includes plans for a new cloud data center in Abu Dhabi as well as a joint technology innovation council to develop more personalized travel solutions.
And earlier this month we signed a $1 billion long-term partnership with EVRY, one of the leading IT services companies in the Nordics, using our innovative cloud technology and global scale, we'll provide a foundation for EVRY to build solutions that create business value and business outcomes for their customers.
This allows EVRY to accelerate the ongoing transformation of their infrastructure business through access to hybrid cloud solutions, based on our SoftLayer platform. These are examples of clients that chose to partner with IBM because we can move their operations into the future. We take over their IT systems and move them to cloud while insuring integration with their existing infrastructure.
We make them more efficient and ultimately drive competitive advantages. Our capabilities and industry expertise give us the ability to address changes in their industry demand and help them compete in markets where data is the new natural resource.
Looking at Integrated Technology Service, revenue was up 4% driven by our cloud solutions. SoftLayer grew strong double-digits this quarter as we continue to increase our capacity.
In September, we opened our second cloud data center in Brazil which offers a full range of SoftLayer infrastructure services including bare metal and virtual servers, storage, security services, and networking.
This past week we just opened a cloud data center in India as we continue to enable local companies to build in-country cloud solutions and we're partnering with NASSCOM to create a platform for thousands of start-ups.
Maintenance revenue grew 1% with continued strength in our third-party hardware maintenance offerings which allows clients to leverage our global reach and inventory capabilities.
Our GTS margin improved quarter-to-quarter, but is down year-to-year, largely reflecting investments we've been making. We continue to invest to bring the most contemporary offerings that are built with cloud, analytics, mobile, security and cognitive technologies enabling us to transform our clients' enterprises and we're investing to expand our global delivery and increase delivery efficiency through automation.
This also requires we continue to rebalance our workforce and we took a charge in the quarter essentially all of which is a year-to-year impact on profit. Finally, currency remains the largest year-to-year impact on profit growth given the strong dollar currency environment.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue of $4.2 billion is down 5%. Outsourcing was up with growth in both process outsourcing and application outsourcing offset by a decline in consulting and systems integration.
As we talked about in the past, in the enterprise application space, we are seeing a shift away from traditional large ERP implementation projects to smaller initiatives that are built around cloud, mobility, security and analytics.
We're continuing to grow in these high value services, but we're still being impacted by larger contracts that are reaching their maturity. Our decline in consulting and systems integration reflects this shift in market demand.
In GBS, we had strong double-digit growth in our strategic imperatives. Cloud and analytic services were both up double-digits this quarter and our mobile practice grew nearly five times.
Earlier this month, we launched the industry's first consulting practice dedicated to helping clients realize the transformative value of cognitive business. The new practice draws on the expertise of more than 2,000 consulting professionals who will help our clients leverage cognitive computing to unlock new possibilities for their business.
Let me give you an example of where we already have work under way with one retailer. When you look back at history, they've been using data for a long time, but even the best retailers would forecast demand based on what happened in the prior year. They would look at what was sold, what season and at what price.
Over time these forecast models became more sophisticated and will include other variables such as location and climate, various market differences. Accuracy improved as more historical data was built up but insight was limited to what was able to be tracked and programmed into their IT systems.
This worked in the past, but let's fast forward to today where much of the new data is unstructured and not able to be understood by traditional systems or traditional programming approaches. Companies that can somehow gain insights from this data will have a competitive advantage.
Today, we're working with this client to build the cognitive solution that harnesses all this unstructured data. The solution will combine the client’s internal data with all kinds of external real-time data sources such as current weather patterns, local events and social commentary.
We are laying the ground work for a Supply Chain that can evaluate the immediate situation, sense anomalies and learn as it goes. This is the potential we’re unlocking with our cognitive capabilities integrating Watson along with the data scientists and industry experts of the GBS cognitive practice.
To further add to our GBS capabilities, at the end of September, we announced plans to acquire Meteorix, a premier Workday services partner. This will expand our reach as Meteorix is cultivated deep expertise and best practices for maximizing returns from these cloud-based HR applications.
Our profit in GBS was down and reflects the market shift that I talk about earlier. In parts of our portfolio, where the market is declining we're seeing price and profit pressure. We continue to shift away from these areas into our high value services around cloud and engagement, but we need to move faster.
Workforce rebalancing charges are up modestly year-to-year as we continue to remix our skills to these strategic imperatives. We also remain focused on our cost competitiveness through alternate labor models and enhancing our global delivery capabilities.
To wrap-up on services, we've built capabilities to deliver the most contemporary offerings to our clients that transform their operations and help them become data driven enterprises. You can see that in our consistent revenue growth in GTS and you can see that in our total services backlog which again grew this quarter.
Our software revenue of 5.1 billion was down 3% which is in line with the trajectory we've seen all year. When you look under the total, we continue to have a headwind from Operating Systems which were down 7% in the quarter and our other middleware which is also down.
Revenue in our key branded middleware which represents about two-thirds of the total was down 1%. We've said in the past that many of our large clients are utilizing the flexibility we've provided in deployment of their software as they build out their environments. This is reflected in our results with growth in our annuity revenue offset by a decline in transactional revenue.
As I just mentioned our software revenue trajectory didn't change from the second to the third quarter, but we did have a slowdown in the transactional revenue at the end of the quarter, predominantly in the U.S. This quarter we again had growth across the solution areas including security, analytics and social and within that, we saw strong growth in our software as a service offerings.
Security software grew to double digit rate. Our security solutions are built on the platform of intelligence, integration, and expertise which in the world of connected devises and an era of hybrid cloud is a key differentiation we bring to the marketplace.
Our solutions are based on platforms, leveraging hybrid environments with an industry dimension. I'll give you an update on two of our platforms, Watson and Bluemix. Last quarter, I talked about how we're building an ecosystem around Watson.
Today, I want to focus on how far along we've come on another dimension when Watson played jeopardy in 2011, Watson just did one service, question-and-answer, underpinned by five technologies like machine learning and natural language processing. Today we have more than 25 different services or APIs, underpinned by more than 50 different technologies like dialogue framing, knowledge validation, voice synthesis, language modeling and visual analysis.
As I discussed earlier, we're also bringing an industry dimension to the Watson platform starting with Watson Health. I'll comment also on progress in our Bluemix platform as a service. The addition of strong loop helps developers connect enterprise apps to mobile IOT and web applications in the Cloud and compose expands Cloud Data Service.
Our Bluemix platform now offers over 130 IBM and third-party services. Security, reliability, and scalability are important in this hybrid environment and to address this, starting this month, Bluemix is now also available on premise behind our customer's firewall.
Clients are taking advantage of our hybrid capabilities, connecting new Cloud and mobile apps to their existing IT infrastructures. This year we've added more than a thousand new customers on our systems middleware like WebSphere which is a reflection of the continued need for clients to support hybrid IT environments.
When you look at our profit performance and software it's driven by the overall revenue trajectory and higher level of investments in areas like Watson and Bluemix and an impact from currency translation.
Turning to our systems hardware segment, revenue of 1.5 billion was down 2% driven by decline in storage. This quarter, z Systems revenue was up 20% since the launch of z13 in the first quarter we've delivered growth of over 40%. Building on the success of Linux on z Systems in the third quarter we introduced the Linux 1 family of products which embraces open source based technologies that are the industry’s most powerful and secure enterprise servers designed for the Hybrid Cloud environment.
These innovations continue to resonate with our customers and we continue to add new customers to the platform across several different industries and countries including Japan, Australia, Singapore, Germany and the U.S.
As we contemporize the platform many of our customers select Linux based z Systems not only to consolidate existing systems to Linux on z to drive operational efficiency, but also to leverage scalability and security that these systems offer.
Power revenue grew 2% which is the third consecutive quarter of growth for the platform. This reflects the kind of revenue performance we would expect from power in a product cycle year. We saw growth in both entry level and the high end systems including strong growth and continued customer adoption in Linux based systems. Our open power initiative continues to progress as we both integrate innovation from the broader ecosystem into our own products and license IP to support third-party power based offerings.
The announcement of our LC line of power based Linux servers and recent collaboration agreement with GENCI, the high performance computing agency in France and our third such large high performance computing national partnership are two examples of how we're bringing innovation from open power partnerships to IBM zone offerings. These power results continue to reflect the progress we're making to transform the platform to align around data and cloud while embracing an open ecosystem.
The growth in our high end servers was more than offset by a double-digit decline in storage hardware driven by weakness in the high end disc and tape. This market is shifting rapidly to flash where we again had very strong growth.
When we set out this year, we saw leverage in the business through the z Systems and power platforms. Our results confirm the progress we've made in the first three quarters and our profit is up 600 million compared to the first three quarters of last year.
Moving on to cash flow. We generated 3.5 billion of cash from operations excluding our global financing receivables. We invested another 900 million in CapEx with a good portion of our spend to build our cloud capacity. And so we generated 2.6 billion of free cash flow which is up 400 million year-to-year. Through the first three quarters of the year, our free cash flow of 7 billion is up over a billion dollars year-to-year.
The primary drivers are lower tax payments and continued improvements in our sales cycle working capital. This was mitigated by the remaining working capital impact to cash flow from our System x divestiture payments for performance based comp which were accrued last year and year-to-year profit performance.
Looking at uses of cash, we spent over 800 million on acquisitions. We've acquired seven companies this year including two in the third quarter which further extend our cloud capabilities and industry expertise. In addition, merge closed last week and we expect Cleversafe to close by the end of the year, so the spend will be included in our fourth quarter results.
In the last nine months, we've returned $7.5 billion to shareholders with dividends of 3.6 billion and 3.8 billion in gross share repurchases to buyback over 24 million shares. Our share count at the end of September was 970 million shares and we had $2.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.6 billion up over a $1 billion from December and flat year-to-year. Total debt was 39.7 billion of which 26 billion was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7 to 1.
Our non-financing debt of 13.7 billion is 3.4 billion lower than a year ago. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was 58%, a point lower than December and the 3.5 points lower than last year. At these levels, we continue to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term.
So now let me wrap up. When you look at our results through the first three quarters of this year, we've expanded margins on a fairly stable revenue base, while we're reinventing our business. We've maintained high levels of investment as we shift our spending to our strategic imperatives.
We're creating new platforms and are building ecosystems including Watson, Watson Health, SoftLayer and Bluemix. And we've been getting returns on our investments, with growth in the strategic imperatives over 30%.
At the same time, the core is declining in a declining market as we deliver productivity to our clients so they can reinvest in the new areas. We've always said this takes time. Especially because much of the new content is delivered as a service and our progression wouldn't be a straight line, but our execution over the sustained period is a proof point that we're on the right path.
So let me come back to our view of the full year. When we look at the transformation we're driving we've made a lot of progress but the GBS transformation is taking longer which is putting some pressure on revenue and profit. And we had a weaker transaction performance at the end of the quarter, which one applied to the larger transaction base in the fourth quarter as a more significant impact.
At the same time, we're going to continue to put a lot of investment into these strategic imperatives where we see tremendous opportunity to accelerate the transformation. Taking all of this into consideration, we've updated our view of the year to $14.75 to $15.75.
Let me put the low end in perspective. 14.75 not only reflect our transaction trajectory at end of the quarter, but is also in line with the typical third quarter to fourth quarter skew. So we're comfortable at that 14.75 level. The change in our view of profit has less impact on free cash flow for the year as most of the transactions would occur late in the quarter anyway and so we still expect free cash flow to be roughly flat for the year.
Let me close with what remains constant. We certainly expect to continue strong growth in our strategic imperatives. We will continue to invest at a high level to drive our transformation while returning value to shareholders and importantly we're continuing to manage the business for the long term. Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to mention the couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi part question. Chris, can you please open it up for questions?

The first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty
Yes, thanks good afternoon. You mentioned that the weaker transaction trajectory going into the fourth quarter would not have a meaningful impact on free cash flow this year due to the late timing of those deals, but does that have a negative influence on 2016 and I appreciate it's too early to give guidance, but what are some of the high level gives and takes on free cash flows as you go into next year? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, thanks, Katy. A few things. As we noted, in the call because of the late nature we don't expect it to have a profound impact in 2015. Now we'll see obviously we have a range in our guidance as you know so we'll see where we finish and if we were to start at a lower point in terms of transactional content coming out of 2015 then there would be an early year impact I would call it but at this point, as you said it's a bit early to call guidance and then we've got 12 months next year to figure out what the macro environment and what the sales cycle looks like, so it is too early to decide if that has a meaningful impact on next year.
And as we go into next year, then we also have a tax impact potentially next year, we're working through cash taxes now so there may be a small cash tax impacted if not the same magnitude as it was in 2014, but there may be a small cash tax impact.
And then we have some things that are going our way. We've been quite efficient at improving our sales cycle working capital this year again and we think there's some momentum there. We also will wrap on the divestiture of our System x business in the first half of next year which was a headwind in this year’s cash flow. So there are a few headwinds and tailwinds which we'll be able to better describe as we get into next year but it's too early to declare that this particular element is going to be an impact next year.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katie. Chris, can we take the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes, thank you. It sounds like the message that you're providing to investors is the strategy of moving to higher value is correct and that it will take time going forward. That said, it feels like you have been surprised or the results would suggest that you've been surprised at the pace at which this stabilization and migration in the business is taking. You've guided down four out of the last five quarters and against an easier comp the last two quarters, your revenue has gotten fractionally weaker.
So I wanted to get your perspective on what has really been different from your forecast and as we look forward, if I just think about 2016, you have currency hedges rolling off, you have very tough mainframe and you power comps because of the product cycles this year, your backlog is down $10 billion in nominal terms which is what you have to deal with for next year. And you've stated that you're going to continue to aggressively invest and so to the timing point I guess, should we be thinking that things actually continue to get worse in the near-term before they get better and I guess the question would be why not and what if any changes are you making?
Martin Schroeter
Okay, well we've -- I think I've gotten all of the questions in so let me try to address them, Toni because there's a lot in there and let me try to address them kind of piece-by-piece. So, we put our guidance in place for 2015 back in January and we said that the trajectory -- the difference between the high and the low was primarily the software trajectory and as we talked about in our prepared remarks and we came out of third we've given the trajectory we would have said we're pointed right at that 15.75 level, but we did observe some longer sales cycle-times particularly in software which we think it's prudent to reflect that experience in our updated guidance, along with what we put in our prepared remarks around transitioning our GBS business into these new areas.
By the way, that transformation which I would characterize is well under way is going well. It's just not going at the speed we'd like it to go. So, we know we have to drive that a bit harder.
When we get to next year, a few comments I think that's important and you brought up currency and I think currency is an important discussion, so we have -- in the third quarter results, we have a pretty substantial headwind from -- in the revenue line and quite a substantial EPS impact in currency in the third quarter. And in fact, when we look at the fourth, there is still a significant impact in the fourth quarter in currency.
So, if we look at the high end and the low end of our guidance and just in the context of currency, at the low end of guidance, EPS at this level would be down 11% and at the high end it's down about 3%.
The currency impact within that in the low end is about half of the year and I'm going to put that now in context of next year because I think it's important. At the low end of guidance, we would actually be growing EPS and that is as we transform the business and we've ramped up our investment.
So, yes, currency is clearly an impact. We don't know when the currency environment will be different. But as we head into next year, what's really important from a currency impact, yes, there will at least at this point based on where the spots are today, there will be an additional impact because we will wrap on hedges, but importantly, we are not losing competitiveness in the marketplace because of currency.
We have a global delivery platform that allows us to make sure we can be competitive in our services business and we have a high margin strategy which allows us to make sure we can be competitive in local marketplaces for our hardware and software.
Now that translation impact or the effect of having that high value and being able to maintain your competitiveness is this issue around how it translates back to profit. And as I mentioned earlier, the impact this year is pretty profound and I would expect that we'll have a currency impact next year that we'll start to talk about when we see where the spots are in January when we provide guidance.
So, in the context of -- again ex-currency or ex-currency, ex-divestitures, revenues down about one for the year so far we'll see where we finish fourth quarter, margins have been expanding and again we'll see where we are for the -- in the fourth, but I would expect margins will expand for the full year and with a currency kind of defining anywhere from half to more than the year-to-year EPS decline, then I think this transformation is making very solid progress and as you said yes, the investments we're making are driving that strategic imperative growth and we're pleased with those results and it's the right thing for us to do to keep these investment levels high.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Toni. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Tien-tsin Huang
Hi, thanks. Just want to build on Toni's question within GBS and consulting and systems integration. I know that took a step back, I heard the transitioning is slower than you expected, but should we expect this to get worse before it gets better? What are you making in the fourth quarter? I know you've been doing a lot of hiring and workforce rebalancing and it's a people business, just trying to get a sense of where we are in that transition.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Tien-tsin. So, it is -- as you said, it is a labor-based business and it's important that everyone I think recognize that in the labor-based business particularly when you have the kind of deep client relationships and you're doing the important kind of work that our clients rely on us it's a business that takes time to shift.
So, when we look at that GBS business today, there is absolutely a high value strategy for this business and when we look at the strategic in imperatives and we look at the margins we're getting on that part of the business in GBS, they are actually higher than the average GBS business and as you know, we announced the creation of the first Cognitive Consulting Group for the enterprise and that's another example of us moving where we see tremendous amount of value, so we will transition this business.
I don't know that I'd characterize where in the process we are. I can say that within our guidance, at the low end, we've not assumed a dramatic improvement and at the high end, we would assume that we make a bit more progress, but we aren't counting or relying on dramatic improvement in the GBS business at this level of guidance.
But again, it is a business that where we get to the other side and we do see high value. It is has a lot of appeal and quite frankly it's what part of what differentiates us in the marketplace. We bring a lot of industry skill into our clients' environments and that's done through GBS, so we're going to keep driving that transformation, we're going to keep remixing those skills, we’re going to keep that team focused on moving where the high value is and again, Cognitive like I said is a good example of that.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tien-tsin. Can we take the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Brian White with Drexel. You may ask your question.
Brian White
Yeah, Martin, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing with your top 250 clients in this software business and where that's headed? And also I'm just curious the week is in the transactional business at the end of September; do you think that's more macro or that the industry will see or more IBM-specific? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Brian. Thanks, so a couple things and we've talked for the last year or so about the large client impact if you will within our transactional software business and remember the transactional part of our software business is only about 30% of the total, but it does have a profound impact on the trajectory of that business. And in the third quarter as you saw, we printed down three for the segment, we were down three in the second, so no real change to the trajectory and that's the way I'd characterize also that large client activity. No dramatic change in trajectory between second and third quarter and the phenomenon continues.
We continue to provide our clients with flexibility for them to deploy the broadest possible part of the IBM portfolio and I think that's the right thing to do. We think that's the right thing to do and we think it's a way to keep our clients moving toward the future of hybrid.
Within the month if you will, I think we'll have to see how the quarter plays out, but there are I think two important elements to keep in mind. One, enterprise technology as you know is a very complex area, so our clients are dealing in very complex environments and they're asking us to help them get to hybrid which means we have to embed our as a service content into the structures they already have and that includes not only the technical aspects of that, but there are business aspects to doing that as well and how they can align their consumption patterns to the way we are able to contract with them. So, there's complexity in the environment, that's a technology statement as well as a business statement and unfortunately, I guess the reality is that not every one of those discussions aligns really, really well with a 90-day reporting period.
And at the same time, the other thing to keep in mind is that every CIO, every enterprise is dealing with its own environment and it would be too soon to tell how that plays out for the quarter, but I do think there is always a reality that our CIOs and others are dealing with around how they navigate their own circumstances. So, we'll see how the quarter plays out.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Brian. Chris, can we take the next question, please?

Next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steve Milunovich
Thank you. Martin could you break down the 9 billion of cloud revenue a more granular way, how much comes from maybe hardware, software of services what the growth rates of those pieces might be?
Martin Schroeter
Steve, sure. A couple things. So we had very good cloud performance again in our business and now this is up 50% in the third quarter on trajectory to be up more than 60 on a year-to-date basis and when we look at the content that we're signing in the new deals for instance we just announced Etihad Airways, we just -- we saw that the elements of those, the things that Etihad is looking for us to do is to bring them into the cloud, so a big component of that is that services element moving into the cloud.
They are also asking, by the way, to help us build a mobile platform that will scale with them and have the global presence they need and that's not dissimilar to what we're seeing in the Lufthansa contracts and the EVRY contract that we just signed.
So, within services we're seeing very good performance, but as you know, not only do we have an as a service business that performed pretty well. We also do a lot of on-prem work where our clients want the agility if you will of the cloud, but their economics suggest that they are better off if they build it themselves.
And so we have a pretty big private cloud business and they build those on our hardware and software content. So, clearly there's some element of the premier Z-platform and the power platform that's sitting within that cloud business. But the hardware performance within the overall trajectory is not having a profound impact on the growth rates. It really is the software business and the services business that's driving the bulk of that growth.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Steve. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
Keith Bachman
Hi. I also wanted to drill down on the software business. It seems like mix is going against you in two ways. First, you have about 34% of your revenue wrapped up in operating systems and other which is in sector of the client and also key brand in middlewear which you said is a little over two-thirds decline this quarter, 1% in constant currency, so I was hoping you could answer two questions.
First is as investors think about a decline of 3% in constant currency, is that the right frame of reference that investors should be thinking about as they look at calendar year 2016?
And as part of that, the second question would be could you give us an update on where you are in terms of business model? In other words IBM has traditionally been license and maintenance and you talk about moving more to consumption or subscription-based model but I would imagine it's a very small part of your business and probably a headwind as we look out at future revenue growth and a source of deceleration. Could you give us any percentages on where you are in terms of that business mix as it relates to your customers? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, so Keith a few things. So, first, we will I think address -- we should address operating systems. Operating systems are about a point headwind to us now and quite frankly, I don't think that point headwind is going to go away in the near-term. In fact we have some of our models suggest it's sort of ever present if you will, so on a segment basis, I think we'll be dealing with a one point headwind from our operating system business.
Now, it will round up to a point. Right now it rounds down to a point, so it's a bigger impact now than it will be, but I think that it's safe to model that business as sort of an ongoing headwind. That's a pretty small part of the business by the way.
So, if we take that part of the system, of the software out and we just talk about the recurring nature of the software business and as I mentioned earlier on a question about 70%, now that includes the operating system, but 70% of our software business is that annuity kind of structure, so think of it as our SAS portfolio which is showing terrific growth rates, but we've got to drive more content into that SAS platform.
Now, that's also by the way newer kind of content for us and so it's a new space and so even though the GP in that area is a little bit lower than what we see in our on-prem business because it's net new content, it's accretive to our margins overall at the IBM level.
So we've got a SAS business that sits within that 70%. We have our monthly license charge business which is the bulk of both our mainframe software as well as our distributed platform software.
Remember our software runs across all platforms and so we've got a pretty powerful monthly license charge business across our hardware platforms and others hardware platforms that's really driving the bulk of the software revenue.
There is a subscription support part of this in the software business as well but you put those all those together again ex Operating Systems because it is a long term headwind we see the rest of those are all growing. That part of the business grows and then in the transactional side as we talked about with Brian a few moments ago, the large client transactional business is being impacted by the consumption if you will and the flexibility we're providing our clients.
Outside the large clients on a year-to-date basis the transactional business is also growing. It's just that it's kind of overshadowed at this point by the larger transactional business, so as we move into 16’, similar to the prior discussions on 16’, we're a bit early to talk about where we are going to be here but our software business I guess what we do know about the software business is one, small headwind from the Operating Systems.
We know that our SAS portfolio will both continue to grow and continue to expand so that will be a positive and we know that we've got some momentum in other parts of the business across our MLC space and across on a year-to-date base -- again getting our software into smaller clients. Clients who haven't absorbed it all I should say, and so I think again we'll see where we go into 2016 but this is not a business that has the characteristics of some long secular decline in it. It is actually made up of a few piece only one of which I think has a long term secular decline and that's a small part it's that Operating System piece. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Keith. Can we go to the next question please?

The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. You may ask your question.
David Grossman
Excuse me. Thank you. I'm just wondering, Martin, I haven't gone through this technology transition and the corresponding impact on your growth rate. Are you or is the Company thinking any differently about the scale of the overall business and the need to have as far reaching of a business as you historically have?
Martin Schroeter
You know, it's a good question, David, and it is one that we think about not from the perspective of size or scale because as you know, we're not trying to be the largest of something. What we are though is trying to be the highest value, so as we move to value, that has, that plays a large influence in how we think about deploying capital and where we think about putting our dollars to work and so at this point, when we look at our businesses and the way they work together and I would argue that the world is moving more toward bringing solutions together in front of a client.
The world is working moving more toward having industry expertise that can apply across a pretty broad platform. We see each of the elements that we have today bringing or adding to that context and so even in businesses where we know we're in transition like our storage business, you know, we said as we said in the prepared remarks our demand is moving to our flash products which is terrific, the right thing to do for our clients and our business is moving to the software side of storage. That's high value and at the same time, while our acquisition of Cleversafe is really about the cloud, it will also help dramatically our storage business as we put objects storage technologies into our storage business, so that makes that part of the business relevant to the way the world's going in cloud.
The future in storage is flash. It's software and it's cloud capable if you will which means object store so what I didn't say in there was we want to be the biggest in storage for instance because we're again on a high value model and you can look across our business and across our segments and we do have that perspective of where we do we think the value is going to be, not is so much of what's going to be the biggest element of that. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks David. Let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
The next question comes from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
James Schneider
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Martin I was wondering if you could address the trends within the consulting and systems integration part of GBS this quarter down 7% versus prior quarter down four. How much of that worsening in the rate of growth is down for pricing versus just macro weakness and what are the prospects of that improving at any point in the future, can you see a point at which that could possibly get out of this negative mid-single digits rate that we're at now and what will be the factors that would drive that or is it simply just a function of the secular decline of that ERP slice of business?
Martin Schroeter
So sure, James and welcome to the call. I think you just picked up coverage on us so welcome to the call. On our GBS business as I noted earlier, we do see where we're making the shift to the most contemporary areas, and digitizing for instance our client’s front offices. We're seeing terrific results. Now they are overshadowed at this point by some of the price pressure we're seeing in other areas of the market but it really is on us here to shift those resources as we can free them up from doing the work they are doing for our clients.
This is not a business that is in long term secular decline. This is a business that relies on us to drive the shift as quickly as possible and I think when you have a business that is so powerful in our clients with such industry expertise that it gives you two things it gives you the visibility to how powerful that model can be but it also says that it's going to take a little while, so some of this is clearly the pricing environment we're in.
I don't think that no there is any reason we shouldn't be able to shift this business and again, the results we see when we do shift are better margins and we see a real ability to influence and to lead our clients into new areas so those are pretty powerful part of our overall model and it is really up to us to keep driving that transformation but it's a big labor based business so it's going to take some time. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Jim. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.
Maynard Um
Hi, thank you. Can you just talk a little bit about the pressures driving the declines in the storage? You talked about that little bit but maybe be a little bit more specific in terms of what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape and what I guess if you can sort of clearly layout your strategy to stabilize or turn that around? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure thanks, Maynard. So on storage I think this is the most we've talked about storage by the way on this call in over a year but I'm glad because this is an important part of the business and we see a lot of opportunity in storage. The storage environment and the pricing environment that we were noting in terms of pressure is really in that high end spinning disc environment, so I don't see that changing dramatically given the industry landscape.
In fact our view has been continues to be that the faster we can move to flash and the faster we can continue to build out our high value software defined storage platforms, and we've had some pretty exciting announcements this year as you know, the sooner we'll see a return to growth in storage.
Now as I noted the storage market is being, is part of the cloud and part of the future of cloud but it’s got to be around objects store because that plays such a critical role in the kinds of use cases that clouds are using, so we'll take as I mentioned the Cleversafe technologies and embed it within our storage, so when we look at the future of the storage business we see terrific growth in flash up again more than 50% in each of the last three quarters, so all this year.
We introduced as I mentioned spectrum software which is around our software storage product and we’ve also announced intentions to continue to invest and to drive our investment where we're seeing those returns and those look quite positive and then as I mentioned the other part of our strategy here is to be I have a more cloud-based offering and that means hybrid and that for us means Cleversafe and embedding our objects store so a lot of price pressure and the spinning disc business but there is a future in storage and it's all about flash. It's all about software defined and it's all about object store.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Maynard. Chris, why don't we take one last question?
Operator
The last question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks, for squeezing me in guys: Martin, I just want to understand are you talking about a weaker transactional business especially at the September quarter and as you go into the next few quarters your mainframe cycle starts to get fairly difficult, I mean do you envision a scenario where assuming FX and macro static you could see some of the revenue stability it of growth in the next quarter?
Martin Schroeter
Well I think I heard the question. You cut out at the end but I'll answer what I think you asked so first of all, boy, I'd love to assume a static currency environment. I'd be thrilled and we know that's not true so we'll be facing a currency headwind over at least the next nine or 10 months but that wasn't your question.
Your question was around how do we wrap and what do we look like, how do we wrap on the mainframe and what do we look like when we come out of the next few quarters and I think a few things we'll have to see how the year plays out in terms of what eventuates from this weaker transactional performance we saw right at the end of the quarter. It's too soon at this point to determine if this is something that's going to persist all the way through the fourth or it's going to persist into the first we don't know.
That's why we gave a range by the way because as we head into the fourth quarter which is as you know our largest transactional quarter, that phenomenon against the much larger transactional quarter says that it's prudent to guide the way we did. Now we will wrap on a mainframe cycle at some point, but the mainframe cycle is not going to have a profound impact on the overall IBM.
It does have obviously it does provide a good bit of revenue tailwind when we're in that cycle but remember that the margins start to expand in the mainframe business as we get toward the later parts of the cycle, so we'll see how we put together 2016 based on how we come out of this year but our guidance right now reflects at the low end a slowdown if you will in the revenue trajectory on a year-to-year basis and the high end reflects a slight improvement so in the trajectory so again, too soon to tell how this plays out for next year.
Martin Schroeter
Let me make a few final comments to wrap up the call. So as we've been talking about on these calls frequently, we are going through a significant transformation and where we've been investing we've been driving tremendous growth and that obviously gives us tremendous confidence that the strategy is right.
The offerings we're delivering into that marketplace are right on and resonating with customers and we're seeing returns. Now as everyone knows, some of the investments we're making have much longer tails, so we're investing heavily in Watson. We're investing heavily in Watson Health. Those returns aren't even in our revenue streams yet but they are the right things to do because those have tremendous futures to them.
Within the current transformation though we're also improving margins as we continue to manage the portfolio and we're expanding margins on what year-to-date has been a fairly stable revenue base and that also includes some pretty aggressive investments that we think is important to drive and as I mentioned we're seeing results so we want to keep driving those investments but we also did say from the beginning of this that it would take time and we also said that we're going to manage for the long term and we're confident in our strategy and confident we're on track to get to the long term trajectory. So thanks again for joining us today.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Patricia. In the second quarter, we delivered 20.8 billion of revenue and operating EPS of $3.84. With that, our revenue for the first half was over $40 billion. Operating net income was 6.7 billion and operating EPS was $6.75. Our revenue was down less than 1% in the quarter and essentially flat for the first half excluding the impact of currency and the divested businesses. Our overall revenue performance includes the continued translation impact from a strong dollar and the impact of divested businesses. Together, these reduced our reported revenue growth by 12 to 13 points, both for the quarter and the half.
I will focus on our revenue performance excluding the impact of currency and divestitures for the balance of the presentation.
Let me give you a quick overview of different parts of our business. Revenue in our strategic imperatives, those that address the market trends in data, cloud and engagement is again up more than 30% in the second quarter and so up over 30% for the first half. This is an acceleration from roughly 20% growth last year. As we’ve said before, we are able to grow at a rate significantly faster than the market because of the industry perspective and deep insight we have from working with our clients on their core businesses to help move them to the strategic areas. We are clearing seeing this in analytics where our revenue is up more than 20% in the first half, well above market rates. This is terrific growth on a large revenue base. Recall we generated $17 billion of analytics revenue last year. The growth is led by GBS and by systems hardware, reflecting the new z13 and POWER8 systems where they specifically address analytics workloads. And we are developing new markets with the advanced cognitive capabilities of Watson.
Our cloud revenue was up over 70% year-to-year in the first half. And over the last 12 months, our cloud revenue was $8.7 billion. We had strong growth in both our private foundations revenue and our as a service offering, and we exited the second quarter with an annual as a service run rate of $4.5 billion. Our cloud business is substantial and growing rapidly. The market continues to evolve beyond pure infrastructure towards higher value process, data and analytics as a service engagements. In the same way the Internet evolved from browsing to a full transactional business platform.
Our clients are finding value in the combination of public, private and hybrid implementations we're able to provide. Our security business was up 10% for the half, social more than 40% while our mobile business quadrupled. From a segment perspective, we saw an increase in demand in our services business with 22 deals over a $100 million this quarter the highest number in over two years, this contributed to a backlog that is up year-to-year for the first time since the end of 2013 which is certainly an encouraging data point.
In our systems business, we have been delivering innovations and repositioning the portfolio and this quarter we again had solid revenue in profit performance. Our System z revenue was up about 50% year-to-date and the z13 performance is in line with previous cycles.
Power grew in the first and second quarters led by strong growth in scale out systems which were capturing both the Unix and Linux opportunity and return to growth in the high end this quarter. Then there were parts of the business that are impacting our second quarter performance but the transformation will pay off over the longer term. Parts of our services business aren't delivering sufficient productivity in the base to fund the investments we're making and to offset the impact of currency.
Now we'll get return on the investments over time but it’s impacting profit growth now. We're making the shift in our offerings as evidenced by our signings and backlog growth, but we need to drive more productivity to improve the profit profile. And some of the geographic regions specifically the BRIC countries are impacting our overall performance. I will expand on that when we discuss the geo performance.
Our first half performance also reflects major portfolio actions we've taken to continue to shift to higher value. Late last year we sold our x86 business; you can see the benefit in our 50 basis point improvement in gross margin and we recently completed the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing business while we continue to focus on advanced semiconductor research. In fact just two weeks ago we announced that an IBM Research led alliance produced the industry's first 7 nanometer chip, another milestone in our contributions to semiconductor innovation. At the same time, we're making significant investments in our strategic imperatives. For example we've created Watson healthcare, we're continuing to build out cloud data centers and we've launched important new partnerships in analytics, mobile, social and cloud.
So to sum it up, our second quarter and first half results are a reflection of the transformation in our business as we move to where we see the longer term value in enterprise IT. The actions and investments are delivering strong growth in our strategic imperatives and continued innovation across our portfolio and we're able to drive overall margin improvement on a fairly stable revenue base. I will move onto the financial metrics but first let me remind you some of the items we've mentioned in our call back in April. We said we grow out pretax income by $1 billion quarter-to-quarter. We said that we'd have more work-force rebalancing than last year and we said we'd have lower gains in our I&E since last year we had gain associated with the sale of our customer care business, and we expect that the stronger dollar would continue to have a significant impact to our revenue and profit. As always we've included a view of the currency translation impact to our revenue in a chart in the back up and you will see that at current spot rates its impact continues to be substantial.
Now turning to the results for the quarter, we delivered 4.6 billion of operating PTI which is up $1 billion from the first quarter. The year-to-year performance in PTI reflects the impact of currency, higher levels of investment and higher workforce rebalancing than last year although the workforce rebalancing charge wasn't as large as we had initially expected. We also had lower divestiture gains year-to-year. Looking at our margins, we had a 20 basis point improvement in gross margin driven by our portfolio actions and a relative performance of System z. Our pretax and net margins benefited from the shift to the higher value as well but they also reflect the dynamics I just mentioned in investments workforce rebalancing and gains which impacted expense.
Our ongoing effective tax rate remains at 20% but we did benefit from a few discrete items. On the bottom line, we reported operating EPS of $3.84. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter which is up 400 million from last year. Over the last 12 months, we've generated $13.2 billion of free cash flow though our realization of GAAP net income is in the high 80s. Over the last 12 months, we've reduced our share count by over 2% and increased our dividend returning about two-thirds of our free cash flow to shareholders.
Now turning to the revenue by geography in total our performance in the major markets was consistent with last quarter while the growth markets decelerated driven by the BRIC countries. To put it in perspective, the BRICs impacted IBM's overall revenue growth rate by 2 points in the second quarter or said another way our revenue excluding the BRICs would have been up 1%. So let me start there, within the BRICS only India had modest growth building on improved operational performance and services. The other three countries were down at a double-digit rate. Brazil was down 16% though our revenue in Brazil last year was up over 20%, so was a very tough compare. The volatility of our results in Russia continued and our revenue in China was down 25% with fewer large transactions in the quarter.
Outside of the BRICs many countries improved their performance sequentially in fact outside of the BRICS our growth markets revenue was up 5%, a 4 point improvement from last quarter. Looking at the major markets, revenue was flat year-to-year. The year-to-year performance in many of the major market countries also improved sequentially including Canada, Germany, Italy, France and Japan. Two of our largest countries Japan and Germany posted the strongest growth. In the U.S. overall revenue was down low single-digit but we once again had good Systems z performance and we've signed substantial new services business.
Turning to the segment perspective, our total revenue was down less than 1% and gross margin improved 20 basis points. I'll spend more time on the revenue and profit drivers in the segment discussions. But let me just make a couple of top level comments, revenue in three of our five segments grew this quarter including our largest segment GTS. This quarter systems hardware posted solid growth with double-digit growth in Z and mid single-digit growth in Power and our Global Financing revenue was up driven by equipment sales and the other two segments GBS and Software our year-to-year performance was fairly consistent with the last few quarters. Our total margin improvement was driven by a shift to higher value. Remember the last quarter, the shift was driven but portfolio actions and the relative strength of System Z.
The reported operating expense and other income is down 9% to this level of spend our expense to revenue ratio was up a 0.5 year-to-year. As we’ve discussed in the past within our large operational expense base we’ve got a shift going on, driving productivity in some areas while significantly increasing our investment in the strategic imperatives. This investment is to build capabilities much of which will be consumed as the service in areas like Watson, Watson Health and Bluemix. And so we’ll see the benefits over the longer term.
The reported decline in expense this quarter is again driven by currency and the divestiture System x. This quarter we also had a higher level of workforce rebalancing and lower divestiture gains, I’ll comment on each. 11 points of the decline was driven by currency between the translation of non-dollar spending and the hedging gains that reported another income in SG&A. Two points of the decline are due to the fact that we no longer have the expense of the System x business in our run rate. And this quarter we took a charge of nearly $200 million for workforce rebalancing, nearly all of which is an increase year-to-year, this drove expense higher by three points. And then divestiture gains were down a 100 million year-to-year driven by last year’s gain associated with the sale of our customer care business, just added about 0.5 to expense growth.
Now let's turn to the segments and we’ll start with Services. Combined service revenue was $12.4 billion, with the year-to-year revenue trajectory a little better than in the first quarter. We closed 22 deals greater than $100 million balance between renewals and new scope or clients. This is the third consecutive quarter signings growth and with it our total backlog was up more than 1% year-to-year. Global Technology Services revenue of 8.1 billion was up 1% with growth in all three lines of business. This is a two point improvement from the first quarter year-to-year performance driven by combination of revenue from backlog in period revenue.
GTS outsourcing return to growth, improving three points sequentially due to several large deals signed last year that are now completing transition. We’re seeing good traction in the contracts that combine traditional IT outsourcing with the integration of mobility, hybrid cloud and analytics workloads. Integrated technology services also return to growth this quarter with strong performance in our cloud, security and business resiliency services.
Growth in SoftLayer accelerated as we’ve significantly increased capacity in new data centers since the beginning of last year and we’re now 41 cloud data centers on five continents. Maintenance grew 2% driven by growth in our multi vendor support services. This is our hardware maintenance offering for third-party platforms which leverages our global distribution and inventory capabilities. Our pre-tax profit in GTS was down, let me spend a minute on this. Currency drove the largest year-to-year impact given the strengthening dollar. We continue to generate significant profits in cash flow in local currencies, but the translation of those currencies back to U.S. dollars significantly effects our reported profit growth.
The divestiture of the System x business impacted our maintenance profit and margin and we took the workforce rebalancing charge in the quarter essentially all of which resulted in the year-to-year impact. We continue to invest for growth for in our strategic imperatives offering such as bringing additional SoftLayer capacity online and increasing our security and mobility go-to-market skills. We’re also opening new resiliency data centers and expanding our global delivery capabilities.
As you would expect, we look to productivity as a way to fund our investments, we didn’t drive that productivity this quarter as we’re always balancing the timing of our transformation with the dynamics of running our clients most critical processes. Global Business Services revenue was 4.3 billion, down 3%. Revenue declined in the practices focused on traditional back office implementations. Customers are migrating away from large ERP projects toward smaller initiatives with cloud, mobility and analytics as their main focus, which was often contracted in and as of service model. We’ve been shifting skills and work from these declining practices to the new opportunity areas, we've had strong growth rates in our strategic imperatives, but we need to shift more aggressively to improve our overall GBS business results. We’re also seeing that long-term application management is becoming more important to enterprise clients as the IT environment grows more complex. Clients are integrating public and private cloud networks; deploy new mobile capabilities into their employ and customer base and deploying analytics around these solutions.
These ongoing changes in clients needs drive both shorter term systems integration as well as long-term management requirements and performance improved across our application management services in the second quarter. Looking at GBS profit, there were few drives of the decline. The largest impact was from the customer care divestiture which drove nine points of the year-to-year decline in profit, due to the sizeable gain in last year’s results. Also we increased the level of investments to further enable our partnerships and we hired a rescaled additional go-to-market and delivery practitioner resources for our fast growing strategic imperative offerings.
For example, we've hired over 2,000 incremental resources into our mobility practices and shifted almost 1,000 to analytics projects. The remaining profit decline was driven by the lower revenue on what is a relatively fixed cost base in the short-term. We remain focused on our cost competitiveness through alternate labor models, more aggressively shifting resources to higher value offerings and enhancing our global delivery capabilities. Our software revenue of 5.8 billion was down 3% with that our first half revenue was down 2% which is consistent with the performance in the second half of last year. Key branded middleware was flat but total software performance reflects the headwind from operating systems and other middleware.
Profit performance in software is a reflection of the overall revenue performance, a higher level of investments in areas like Watson and Bluemix and an impacting currency translation. We had growth across the solution areas including security, commerce and social and within that we saw strong growth in our Software-as-a-Service offering. As security software revenue returned to double-digit growth. Our security solutions bring together intelligence, integration and expertise that are essential in the world of advanced threat. As an example, one of the top 10 global energy firms was looking for an analytics based approach to protect tens of thousands of systems and devices globally from advanced threats.
IBM brought together a security solutions and services expertise to establish a security operation center to monitor billions of logs and events on a daily basis. This intelligent approach to threat management has allowed them to focus their resources on only the handful of high priority threats that want further investigation. And another of our solution areas our commerce software grew. Our commerce solutions are allowing client to get unique insights about their customers. Nine of the top 10 U.S. retailers and each of the top 10 global banks run an IBM’s commerce solutions. IBM commerce now powers 30,000 organizations globally. Our social solutions again grew double-digits driven by strong performance in both Kenexa and advanced collaboration offerings.
We’re continuing to bring innovations to our solutions areas and deepen our industry focus. Watson as an example where we’re creating a market around cognitive computing and building an as a service business. Last quarter I talked about expanding the Watson ecosystem, this quarter I want to focus on another aspect of our progress. Watson’s being deployed across nearly 30 countries and in 20 industries. We are currently working on 100s of projects to expand industry domain knowledge as well as teaching the system new languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and Arabic. We continue to expand Watson’s reach by forging additional partnerships and just last week we announced a formation of a joint venture with Mubadala to bring IBM Watson to the Middle East and North Africa with focus on healthcare, retail, education, banking and finance. Our focus in software continues to be innovation, partnership and aligning to the needs of our customers in the industries in which they operate.
Turning to our systems hardware segment. Revenue of 2.1 billion was up 5% and pretax income was up 26%. These results are reflection of both our ability to continue to deliver innovation across our high end systems and the significant actions we’ve taken. This quarter’s Z Systems revenue was up 15% and through the first half we grew about 50%. Power revenue grew 5% this quarter. We saw growth in both the low end and the high end where we’ve introduced new POWER8 based systems. The capabilities of both mainframe and power systems are resonating well with our customers and we continue to add new customers to the platforms.
During our investor briefing earlier this year I talked about the mission critical nature and expansion of banking transactions that our mainframe supports. Our Z System offers the most secure, reliable and scalable platform with the best price performance. So when a leading managed service provider in Europe was looking to create a cloud platform for independent software vendors serving financial services clients they opted from mainframe. This is another new IBM mainframe customer.
In that same Investor Day presentation, we talked about the explosion of data and transaction volumes in the telecommunications industry. So when a leading telco solutions provider in China was looking to offer a customer experience solutions to its global clients it selected power on Linux over X86. The power platform provides both higher capacity and better performance on X86, allowing them to incrementally scale out their solution.
Our open power strategy continues to take hold globally. In June, the UK government joined the United States as the second major government to turn to open power for its high performance computing priorities. The UK government will utilize IBM’s latest open power high performance computing and Watson based cognitive technologies to obtain valuable insights from a variety of data sources to boost productivity and drive growth. This is a similar class of IBM open power system that the United States Department of Energy selected for the Lawrence Livermore Oak Ridge National Laboratories. I believe our power results through the first half show that the power strategy is working.
Our storage hardware revenue was down 4%. We again saw strong growth in our flash system with our new generation offerings introduced in the first half. This growth was once again offset by the wind down of our OEM business and continued weakness in high end disk. Our systems hardware segment revenue growth and profitability improvement is a clear result of the actions we’ve taken to position our systems business for the future.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow which is up 400 million year-to-year. Of course this is after nearly $1 billion spend in CapEx consistent with last quarter and with last year. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $4.5 billion is up over 800 million year-to-year. The primary drivers were lower cash tax payments and an improvement in our sales cycle working capital. This was partially offset by the remaining working capital impact to cash flow from our system x divestiture payments for performance based compensation which were accrued last year and operational performance. As you know our annual free cash flow generation is skewed to the end of the year, and our first half results are in line with that skew. Do remember we said that we'd improve our free cash flow realization from 2014 to 2015 and earlier this year we expected realization in the mid to high 80s we now expect the full year to be about 90% but even at the low end of the profit guidance this reflects a modest year-to-year improvement and free cash flow for the year.
Looking at uses of cash we spent 700 million on acquisitions. We've acquired five companies in the first half. These add to our capabilities and cloud and analytics and deepen our industry domain expertise to further differentiate our solutions. For example the two acquisitions made by Watson Health strengthen IBM's leadership and healthcare analytics and to support our effort to apply cogon of computing to drive healthier patient outcomes.
In the last six months we've returned to $4.7 billion to shareholders, this includes 2.4 billion in dividends and 2.3 in gross share repurchases the buyback over 14 million shares. At the end of June we had 987 million shares outstanding and $3.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.8 billion, up 300 million from December, but down from a year ago. Total debt was $38.7 billion, of which just over $26 billion was in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7:1.
Our non-financing debt of $12.6 billion is down $4.5 billion from a year ago. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was 55% which is down four points from December and almost a point lower than a year ago. We continue to be well positioned to support our long-term growth strategy. But now let me wrap it up and talk about our expectations for the full year. It's been us move aggressively and decisively to reshape our business to best address the long term value in IT. We've been shifting investments in resources building partnerships and ecosystems and introducing key innovations. Since the beginning of the second quarter we launched Watson Health acquiring Phytel and Explorys and partnering with the other leading healthcare companies. We finalized the divestiture of our semi-conductor manufacturing business to global foundries while we introduce the breakthrough in seven nanometer technology.
We announced that we had embedded spark into our analytics and commerce platforms and formed an innovative new cloud partnership with Box.
Each one of these actions contributes to our transformation and improves our hand for the long-term. So let's talk about what it means for 2015. In the first half our revenue in the strategic imperatives grew more than 30%. Those markets were also growing, but with our performance we're clearly gaining share. The core portfolio continued to decline in a declining market. So together the strategic imperatives and core delivered revenue at an IBM level that was roughly flat. But for the full year we continue to expect to deliver operating EPS of $15.75 to $16.50 and even at the low end of the range we now expect the modest year-to-year improvement and free cash flow for the year. We said from the beginning of the year the primary variable between the high end and low end of the guidance is our software revenue trajectory. From a margin perspective for the full year, we continue to expect to expand margin driven by portfolio actions. We also said we'll continue a high level of investment and we'll continue to return value to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends.
For the third quarter if you look back over the last few years we typically see about a billion dollar decrease in revenue from second quarter to third quarter. There is no reason to think this year will be different than our typical seasonality so with the billion dollars last quarter-to-quarter third quarter revenue would be about the same size as the first quarter. Now what is different is the mix of business relative to what we've seen historically. But even with that will continue to expand margin in the third quarter driven by our portfolio actions. When you look at some of the other dynamics and the third form a year-to-year perspective currency impact investments, workforce rebalancing, the third quarter profit trajectory looks a lot like the second. Now there are some differences like we don’t have a gain in last year's third quarter results but on balance the year-to-year profit would be pretty similar to 2Q. This is true for the EPS trajectory as well.
Through the first half relative to the low end of our guidance we are at the same point as last year, and ahead of the year before. In the third quarter given the profit trajectory I just described we expect to finish the third quarter with 63% to 64% of our low end EPS guidance achieved consistent with prior years. And then where we finish within the range for the full year really depends primarily on whether we have a change in trajectory and our software business. Importantly as we progress in our transformation we’ll exit the year a higher-value business.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.
Operator, can you please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about software, the business was down 3% at constant currency, I think other than the financial crisis in '09 that's the lowest software growth rate in the last 15 years. You also had a significant pressure, accompanying pressure on margins. And I am wondering if you can kind of step back. At the beginning of the year you were hoping for an improvement and talking about the guidance, it looked like perhaps you are not as confident, you were saying we could end up at the low end of the range if we don’t improve, maybe we'll do better than that if we do improve.
But I am wondering if you can kind of step back now that you are half way through the year. The results seem to suggest that there is something structural impacting your software business. Now whether that’s the decline that we've seen in UNIX over the last couple of years or whether it's the migration to as a service, there seems to be an inflection point over the last four quarters in your software business for the worst. And I am wondering if you can step back and tell us if you agree with that and what you think is driving this and do you have confidence like the same level of confidence as you did six months ago that the software business will improve throughout the year?
Martin Schroeter
A few comments I think on software and some of these themes are going to be consistent with what we've talked about and then some of them will be I guess observations and we go through the year. So relative to, first relative to guidance as we said since the beginning, the difference, the primary difference in our guidance range for the year is driven by the trajectory of software. And so when we went through in the prepared remarks and pegged third quarter to the low end I wasn’t suggesting that we don’t see that difference still, in fact we do still see software driving the difference between the low and the high end but we do have to when you have a range you do have to pick one side to anchor your analysis. So we chose in this case to anchor to the low side.
With regard to software there are some consistent themes here that we've been observing now for a while. We do still have in our overall growth rate a headwind from the operating system element of our business, so it was about a point. Additionally, what we saw in the BRIC countries' impact on IBM and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks even though the BRICs are relatively small, only about 7% of our revenue, they had a two point impact on the growth. That same phenomena translated into key branded middleware.
So ex the BRICs our key branded middleware segment, software segment would have had 2 points of growth as well. So when we look underneath that I think the consistency here is that we have two phenomena. Within our top 250 clients and we've talked about the substantial both investment and commitment those clients made to the software platform, within that client base we continue to offer and they continue to utilize flexibility so that they can fully deploy middleware across their environments. And that phenomena hasn’t changed.
Now outside of that top 250 clients we do see growth. We have seen growth, we have been growing there and we continue to grow. So it really is this flexibility that we are providing to our clients which we still think for the long-term as the right thing to do as they commit to the platform.
Operator
The next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMC. You may ask your question.
Tien-tsin Huang
Just on the strategic imperatives I guess up 30% again, so up 30% I guess for the first half. I am curious if that growth rate is sustainable into the second half. Martin I know you suggested it could come down to the 20% level of last year, but checking to see if that's still the case for the second half of the year?
Martin Schroeter
So it was quite a good acceleration as we mentioned in the last call from the fourth into the first and as you note and as we just talked about in our prepared remarks, we were able to maintain that trajectory into the second quarter. So we finished first half in a very strong position in strategic imperatives. And given our growth rates and where we think that market growth rate is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think we're growing share across that space as well. When we look forward in those strategic imperatives and we look forward at the overall revenue trajectory of IBM, we don’t have assumed, we have not assumed a dramatic improvement if you will in the overall revenue trajectory at the low end of our guidance. At the high end obviously as we just talked about in the last question and in prepared remarks, the high end we assume an improvement in the software trajectory, some of which will be in the strategic imperatives obviously. In fact the weighting of our software business and strategic imperatives is larger than the overall business. So I would expect that we would see an improvement in that. But again our current guidance at the low end does not assume a dramatic improvement in the overall revenue trajectory. And so within that the mix between the strategic imperatives again which has a lot of momentum versus the core, we're not suggesting that we have to grow or we have to change the trajectory at the low end.
Patricia Murphy
Christine, can we take the next question please?
Operator
Next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. You may ask your question.
David Grossman
Last quarter Martin we discussed cash taxes as a tailwind this year but offset by other headwinds. And then as of April it appeared the cash taxes would be actually free cash flow headwind in 2016. Is that still the case and if so are there known tailwinds next year that would offset that and allow the free cash flow conversion rate to remain in that 90% plus range that you've talked about for this year.
Martin Schroeter
A few things, so and there are a number of metrics here I want to make sure that we triangulate to the right answer and that we don't confuse or we don't mix some of the data points, so cash taxes as you know last year were substantial year-over-year headwind and this year they're not a year-to-year headwind and the amount of cash tax tailwind that we're getting this year is the same as we thought it was going to be at the beginning there, so no change to that.
Now let's switch for a second to the realization metrics, so cash taxes were about a 10-point headwind to realization to last year, very dramatic headwind to our realization. This year they're still a headwind although much reduced, so the realization impact is only about a point or two, so when you think about the relationship of what's going on our cash tax rate will still be a little hit higher than our book rate although not as high as it was last year. So this year cash taxes will be a little bit higher than the book rates so there still a realization impact but there is a year-to-year tailwind in terms of payments.
Now next year we still have a lot of work to do and a lot of planning to do and while we have a small headwind in realization this year, we do see a headwind in realization next year and how that translates to a year-to-year I think we have to spend the next six months trying to figure that out and then we'll have more guidance in January for you, but again there are different elements here. So from the realization cash taxes are still a headwind this year although smaller than last year and next year we expect them to be a headwind but we'll have to translate as we get closer and to what that means on a year-to-year base for 2016, but as we just mentioned in our prepared remarks we do see now a modest improvement in free cash flow for this year.
Patricia Murphy
Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. You may ask your question.
Lou Miscioscia
So can we step a back to the services side in the sense that consulting system integration was weak again and you had talked about having to shift some of your resources maybe you can go in and say the cloud or ERP deployments are going down or being replaced by SaaS developments maybe you're not winning as many products they're giving that others are growing actually consulting pretty well here in beginning of 2015?
Martin Schroeter
So a few things, our GBS and when we talk about consulting systems integration, I'll just focus the answer on our global business services segment. GBS was as you noted down again in the quarter although quarter-to-quarter we had about 1 point improvement in the trajectory still down but a bit better than the first and the dynamics within that I think are similar to what we saw in the first which is the shift that we're undertaking and what you've noted in your question, the shift that we're undertaking is pretty dramatic and we're seeing very strong double-digit revenue growth within the strategic imperatives within the GBS business alone.
Now that we also have a pretty substantial -- think about it as a traditional ERP implementation kind of consulting business and the net of the shift to the shift of those strategic imperatives and obviously the reduction in our resources applied to those larger implementations the engineered shift is not yet at the point where the revenue growth coming from those imperative is offsetting if you will our reduction in those the areas that address those traditional ERP. So the course is still the largest part of the portfolio that was traditional parts of ERP implementations and while we engineer that shift we're going to see declines in that part of the business, but as I mentioned that shift is driving growth in the strategic imperatives we just have to continue to be as fast as we can to get those areas so we can see growth overall for the GBS business.
Patricia Murphy
Could we take the next question please, Christine?
Operator
The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steve Milunovich
A couple of non-operating items, Martin, last quarter you suggested currency could hit EPS about $0.80 for the year I was curious if that's still the number and it looks like your expectations for the next few quarters on currency at similar to a little worse than in the April quarter and I am little surprise given the move in the Euro than also was curious about the 17% tax rate, should we carry that forward does that go back to 20?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, thanks, Steve. Few things so first on tax, we'll start at the back on tax. So we still see a 20% rate for IBM that's the right operating rate if you will for us, we did have as I noted in the call a couple of discrete items in the quarter but those were discretes in the quarter. Now we do have discrete throughout the year but 20% is the right number for tax.
On currency impacts, I'll come back to earnings in a moment the first part of the question, currency impact is now a little bit worse for the year relative to what we expected just 90 days ago. So you may remember we include as we always do we include a supplemental chart on the impact of currency and we had on that chart in April that the third quarter would be about an 8-point impact and the fourth quarter would be about 5 year-to-year and now we see 8 to 9 and 5 to 6 in terms of the currency impact and that data again is in the supplemental chart. And so we are seeing an increased -- a slight increased currency impact for the second half of the year.
Now our view of currency and its impact on profit is and can be, as you would imagine the translation impact can be quiet substantial. So we did say that the impact to earnings would be about $0.80 for the year and we still see, while it's gotten a little bit worse we still think that’s probably little bit worse as well, but we can hold that within the guidance we’ve given. So, yes the impact to EPS is probably a little bit worse than what we had assumed. We do have actions underway to try to navigate through whatever currency environment we’re in, but the year-to-year impact is still fairly substantial in our guidance.
Now of notes -- of note is that the guidance as you know reflects a EPS of flat to downsize and the currency impact is five points, roughly in terms of earnings. So if we were in benign currency environment, we’ll discard the idea of it being an actual tailwind at some point. But if we were in a benign currency environment, our guidance would reflect flat to up five and that’s the kind of impact I think that you would expect to see in a company that has more than 60% of its revenues, and cash flows and profits, dramatic part of this profits operating in currencies other than the dollar.
So the short answers to your questions tax 20 is still the right thing in terms of operating, the currency impact is a little worse than what we assumed from 90 days ago and it is a dramatic year-to-year impact on our profitability.
Patricia Murphy
Let's go to the next question please Christine.
Operator
The next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.
Brian White
Martin it sounds like services you got from bigger deals in the quarter, minor services in aggregate beat our number. When can we start to see margins improve back to levels that we saw two, three years ago in the services business?
Martin Schroeter
Yes, we did see as you saw a very strong signings quarter which as we noted in the prepared remarks drove our backlog to 1%, ex-currency is the first time we’ve had backlog both in a couple of year. So obviously very encouraging to get the services backlog growing, so we can start to see a more consistent delivery of revenue growth. Obviously within that revenue growth in that business does drive profit leverage, but keep in mind that we continue to invest quite heavily as well in order to make sure we’re building the right cloud platforms, the right skills around that services business.
So while the single largest impact year-to-year and our services profitability not on margins, but services profitability is the translation of those profits back to dollars given the dollar strength. We do see an opportunity to continue to invest quite heavily in our services business. We do see opportunities to continue to move not only the GTS business, but the GBS business to higher value and over time that will drive margin improvements.
But for now, we’re not relying on margin improvements in our guidance for this year. But again the single largest impact on a year-to-year basis is currency. So as we continue to invest while that revenue grow -- if we were to grow we continue to grow revenue in GTS for instance that will drive some leverage in the profit model, we’re going to continue to invest pretty heavily going forward.
Patricia Murphy
Can we take the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
Keith Bachman
Martin, I want to follow-up on that last point, I understand currency impact on the Services segment. But as you look out beyond the next quarter or two. Won't you need to A: continue to invest in these businesses on both GBS and GTS? And B: as you make that adjustment to the higher growth areas is there a mix impact that will continue to weigh in on margins even as you look out a bit further than the near-term quarter. So both the investment side and the mix side as you think about both sides of services please?
Martin Schroeter
So couple of things Keith; first, we will continue to invest. So let's assume we’ll get through at some point, the year-to-year impact of currency and we’ll just take currency out of the equation for a second. When we look at our model, we see a few elements that will continue to drive profit growth within services while at the same time continuing to invest. So first we will continue to drive capacity utilization into our cloud business, so remember we’re investing pretty heavily in cloud and I would say that those businesses are not yet at scale. So as we get those and utilize that capacity and get to scale then we’ll see margin improvements in the services business. Secondly we continue to shift that overall portfolio to the most contemporary highest value offerings that our clients are demanding and I think you can see that both in the signings we had for instance in our services business and the backlog growth you can see it and the strategic imperative performance within GBS.
So we continue to shift those offerings to higher value. And then underpinning that the delivery side of this, the delivery elements of this including much broader deployment of intellectual property leveraging our software and research ability to put automation into our delivery content. So, we do still see opportunities to keep a balance between we’ll keep investing but we’ll also be able to drive a more efficient delivery platform as we go through -- as we get out of this currency environment.
And then finally, I think it’s important to note that while we do make use pretty heavy use in some countries like the U.S. we have a pretty good global delivery platform within the U.S. that’s not the same everywhere in the world. So, in some regions in the world our use of global delivery is still under 30%, so we still have opportunities in those regions to move more of our delivery into a global delivery format. So I still see between the shift to higher value between getting cloud to scale and the move to automation and getting more of our regions into the global delivery environment. We still have room to improve margins and services.
Patricia Murphy
Christine can we please take the next question.
Operator
The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citibank. You may ask your question.
Jim Suva
In your prepared comments you mentioned a little bit about operating expenses as a percent of sales have increased due to the mix shift and my belief is understandable and I assume you’re referring to the mix shift in more strategic imperatives and it can’t -- and so that manifesting itself a nice growth I think you said up 30% year-over-year which is good. Can you help us understand the timeframe or the milestones for judging and assessing the strategic imperatives and the investment in them of when we start to really start to see leverage to the model of leveraging that growth into a lot more profitability? Or in other words how much longer do you have to keep really investing a lot more ahead of all that?
Martin Schroeter
So a few things, in the prepared remarks on expense what we talked about was a slightly higher E to R in the quarter and we wanted to go through make sure everyone understood that the 9% year-to-year improvement in expense was driven heavily by just the translation the currency impact which is actually 11 points a year so currency obviously has an impact on the expense side as well. We also talked a bit about the impact of having the expense from our system ex-divestiture now out of our run rate so that was a couple of points.
So we wanted to make sure that everyone understood, our investors understood that we continue to invest and that’s why E to R is up in terms of the second quarter. Now when do we get through that? Boy, we see an industry where innovation where industry skills and knowledge are the differentiators in many of our engagements. And so a lot our investments are focused on yes the strategic imperatives as you said which is a combination of shifting out of things that we were doing into new things it's also part of growing that overall investment pool but within those investments yes there’re strategic imperatives but it’s also a lot of investments around building industry skills, industry talent because more and more our clients are looking for that industry point of view.
So I don’t know that we get through if you will the bow to shift through the wave in terms of expense in terms of investments when do they slow-down. Now I do think they’re paying off. We had tremendous growth in cloud again we have tremendous growth all across the strategic imperatives. So, shifting this expense as we’ve talked about in the beginning of the year is absolutely the right thing for us to do for the long-term. We can see that pay off in terms of the market share we’re growing in those strategic imperatives. Now those will continue to pay dividends for a long-long time within that as you know we’re building a number of as a services businesses including Watson, so I think that those investment levels are important I think we’ll continue to maintain those investments because we’re building some very appealing businesses underneath those strategic imperatives.
Patricia Murphy
Christine can we please take the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. You may ask your question.
Joseph Foresi
I was wondering if we could get some sense of what percentage of revenue the strategic imperatives are and how do they impact your visibility on the business? And then just one last one have we had a positive inflection point on the services backlog?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. So a couple of things that we hit a positive inflection on the services backlog we’ll start with that. So, the backlog is $120 billion plus, so it’s hard to make it move if you will. We had a very good signings quarter as we talked about 22 deals greater than 100 million we still see a lot of opportunity in terms of additional services opportunity. But getting that substantial backlog to move it takes a lot of services, signings of our consistent period of time. So while we see very good demand it’s tough to predict on a 90 day basis where the backlog is going to be again given it’s a 122 billion that we’re trying to move.
Now as a percentage of revenue we've talked about last year in Investor Day we talked about it on a full year basis had about 27% and we said in Investor Day that we’re going to grow that to about 40, be more than 40 billion about 40% of our revenue by 2018. Now I think even there is seasonality in this number I would say we are certainly ahead of the 27 given the growth and we're making tremendous progress toward that 2018 goal of 40% of our business but given the seasonality I'm not sure that whether where we are within that range is all that insightful. We will take our temperature again on this at the end of the year so that get a data point without much seasonality or that any seasonality but again from 27 last year we are on our way to 40 and I'd say the two data points that we have of 30 plus first quarter and second quarter are in very good shape remember that we showed at Investor Day we show the chart that said these have been growing at about 19% fairly consistently over the last few year. So you should assume and I think we're comfortable that we are making very good progress on that longer term goal.
Patricia Murphy
Christine, can we please take one last question.
Operator
The last question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.
Amit Daryanani
Just wanted to get back to the software segment. Can you just talk about -- do you think the business performed in the June quarter inline to your plan or was it ahead of the low and then when you look at the PTI margin decline you saw in software is that reflects to the flexibility you are providing to your customer when they move to strategic imperative and it should get back to more normalize level once you get beyond that I guess initial transition or does that really reflect more of the reality that some of these strategic imperative revenues maybe at a lower margin than your legacy revenues are?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. You made a couple of things. So, in terms of in line with the plan we've said since the beginning of the of the year that the at the low end of guidance we don’t assume a change in trajectory and at the high end we do and that's to by the way to over simplify up nearly 100 billion corporation but will over simplify for the purpose for this question and right now given that the change the trajectory in software has not changed I'd say that we are right in line with our plan but we are right in line with that low end of guidance. I don’t think that would surprise anybody.
With regard to the margin a couple of things one software is very high margin element and can continue to be a very high margin component of our overall mix. Now when we look at margin if I think there are two things I would disaggregate on a gross profit level margin the only real shift we see is a slight shift to our SaaS properties. And so while they are coming at slightly lower margins than our traditional on plunders business they are still highly accretive to the overall IBM model because bear in mind these are new spaces for us were not taking and converting the non-prem business to it and as a service business we are building new revenue streams and spaces where in spaces where we are not today.
So slightly lower gross margins on the SaaS business but all accretive to the IBM model and then the net margin in our software business reflect a lot of the investments that we've talked about both in strategic imperatives and remember we continue to invest in our core businesses because as we talked about it at Investor Day in other venues that contemporary nature of those while they are products that have been in our client sites for many-many years and they are committed to this products those products evolve into the latest most contemporary needs as well. So those products now have to live in and support our clients in a mobile world in a social world and they have to have analytics capabilities as well so the old products are also part of that investment and so.
From an investment standpoint I would say that you're seeing the investments in our software business on the net margin line.
Martin Schroeter
So let me take a few minutes to wrap up the call. We're half way through now of transformation here and you can see in our results that the investments and of course the shift in our business we're seeing good progress as we move more of our business into the strategic imperatives, we've been very active in reinventing our hardware business and I think that's paying off and the investments and the added focus we've put on the solutions areas are contributing to some pretty strong growth in those strategic imperatives.
So, with six months behind us we've maintained our full year of EPS even though as I mentioned in the remarks and in the Q&A that currency is probably little worse than it was at the beginning of the year but will maintain our EPS guidance and as we talked about in the prepared remarks we've taken up our view of our free cash flow modestly, so modest growth free cash flow for the year. We said from the beginning that this will take some time, we continue to manage the business for the long-term and we're confident that we're on track to that longer term trajectory.
So thanks very much everyone for joining us today.

Thanks, Patricia. In the first quarter, we delivered $19.6 billion of revenue, $2.9 billion of operating net income, and operating EPS of $2.91; that's up 9% from last year. It's quite a good start to the year, and obviously better than the mid-single-digit growth we discussed 90 days ago.
Our revenue was flat year-to-year, excluding the impact of currency and the divested businesses. There's been a lot of focus on the implications of a stronger dollar, especially to companies like IBM, where, as you know, two-thirds of our revenue are outside the U.S. So let me address this right up front.
In the first quarter, we had an eight point impact from currency translation. This impact is even greater than 90 days ago, and also from the update we provided at the end of February. As always, we put a chart in the back-up that shows the impact of currency translation to revenue for the first quarter and the full year.
And as we shift our portfolio to higher value and divest businesses that no longer fit our strategic profile, this also results in an impact to our reported revenue growth. In the first quarter, it was over four points. So together, the impact of currency and the divested businesses reduced the reported revenue growth by 12 points.
Now, for the balance of the presentation, I'll focus on our revenue performance at constant currency, and excluding the impact of the divested businesses. This is the way we look at our business, and again, on that view of our business, our revenue was flat year-to-year.
At our investor briefing at the end of February, we spent a lot of time on how we are transforming our business to where we see long-term value in enterprise IT. We have a core portfolio that's high value to our clients and high value to us. Quite frankly, it's essential. While the market for these capabilities isn't necessarily growing, we continue to reinvent and innovate to deliver that value.
We've also been investing in our strategic imperatives, our solutions that address the opportunities in data, cloud, social, mobile, and security. These are high-value solutions and we're able to grow at a rate significantly faster than the market because our offerings are highly differentiated and because our core businesses provide the industry perspective and deep insight into how our clients operate.
In February, we showed you the revenue across our strategic imperatives has been up 19% to 20% in each of the last five years. And now in the first quarter, revenue in our strategic imperatives grew more than 30%, so a good start toward another strong double-digit year.
Analytics was up more than 20%; Social, more than 40%; and Mobile, more than 4x. Our cloud revenue was up over 75% year-to-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, our cloud revenue was $7.7 billion. This is a demonstration of high growth in the higher value cloud opportunities across public, private, and hybrid.
We had a terrific performance in our cloud foundational and as a service offerings and we exited the quarter with an annual as-a-Service run rate of $3.8 billion; that's up $1.5 billion in the last year. The bulk of that growth was organic, the result of our deep insights into how our clients run their business.
We've applied that insight to develop a strong point of view on cloud, that the value in cloud is hybrid. In February, we announced a program to make hybrid cloud a reality for the enterprise, extending our clients' control, visibility, security, and governance in a hybrid cloud environment, similar to what they have in their private cloud and existing IT systems. And to deal with the data sprawl, we're providing increased data portability across environments.
Now while we're investing and driving growth in our strategic imperatives, we're continuing to reinvent and bring innovation to our core portfolio. For example, in our hardware business, we've continue to invest and innovate. That's how we've been able to introduce the z13 mainframe that is built for the mobile economy and roll out Power 8, optimized for data and cloud. We've also made some visible divestitures and we're now starting to see the results of those actions.
In March, we shipped the first z13 system and our mainframe revenue more than doubled on MIPS shipments that were up 95%. Power returned to growth, leveraging strong performance in our scale out systems. All of this is driving our shift to higher value, resulting in a higher margin and supporting targeted investments.
In fact, in 2015, we're shifting billions of dollars of spending to data, cloud, and engagement to extend our differentiation in the market. And in the last few weeks, we've announced two initiatives, Internet of Things and Watson Health, that will further strengthen our position as a high-value innovation company providing solutions at the intersection of business and IT.
So, to sum it up, our results this quarter at the IBM level and the segment level reflect the transformation in our business. We had continued momentum in our strategic imperatives and strong growth in hardware, resulting from the innovation we continue to deliver.
The declines in the core portfolio were consistent with the second half of last year, and our shift to higher value drove margin expansion and we're continuing to shift investments and rebalance resources to address the best long-term opportunities in the market.
So, now I'll get into the details of the quarter. Our revenue was flat year-to-year, a two point improvement from our year-to-year performance in the third and the fourth quarters.
At the risk of oversimplifying this quarter's revenue dynamics, our strategic imperatives were up over 30%, which is 10 points faster than last year. And bear in mind, we have a pretty substantial business in cloud and analytics alone, so it's on a big base. And our core businesses had a similar trajectory to what we delivered in the second half of last year, so our substantial strategic imperatives growing 10 points faster drove two points of sequential improvement.
Looking at our margins, we had an 80 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by both portfolio actions and strong growth in System z. To put that 80 basis points into historical context, gross margin of 49.3% is up about 1,400 basis points in the last 15 years. And you'll get that same trend from a margin perspective whether you back three, five, or 10 years.
In terms of gross profit dollars, we generated $9.5 billion in the quarter, and that's up $2.7 billion from 15 years ago. So, this is clearly the result of our long-term relentless shift to higher value. Our pretax and net margins benefited from the shift, as well, but they also reflect a smaller charge for workforce rebalancing this year.
On the bottom-line, we reported operating EPS of $2.91, up 9%. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up from last year, and as you know, there's a lot of seasonality in the timing of our cash flows, much more so than in our net income. We return $1.2 billion through share repurchase and nearly the same amount in dividends, and we ended the quarter with $8.8 billion of cash on hand, up from year-end.
Now turning to the revenue by geography, we had sequential improvement in our year-to-year performance in both the major markets and the growth markets, led by the U.S., Japan, and Latin America.
Revenue in the major markets was flat year-to-year. We grew in the U.S., with strong growth across our hardware portfolio and some large software deals, so we had a good transactional performance in the U.S. Japan growth accelerated on the strength of services and hardware.
We continued to the mixed performance in Europe, with growth in the U.K. and declines in Germany and France. From a brand perspective, we had good growth in mainframe and power, and continued momentum in outsourcing signings, as clients look to integrate cloud and mobile capabilities into larger scale IT environments. Overall, while our performance in Europe decelerated, it was in line with the market.
In the growth markets, Latin America returned to double-digit growth, with broad-based growth in the region, and we had growth in the Middle East and Africa. The Asia-Pacific growth markets again declined, though we had sequential improvement in some key countries.
Our year-to-year performance in the BRIC countries improved sequentially, though the total BRIC number is not reflective of the individual country's performance; we had growth in Brazil and India, and declines in Russia and China.
In China, we again had very strong growth in mainframe, but our services revenue declined as we shift our focus away from some of the lower margin offerings. Bear in mind, we do have a profitable business in China.
Turning to the segment perspective, our total revenue was flat and gross margin improved 80 basis points. As always, I'll go into the revenue drivers in the segment discussions, but I want to spend a minute on margin dynamics. When you look at the drivers of margin improvement we've talked about in the past, a shift to higher value has been a big contributor. This quarter, we saw the shift coming from portfolio actions and strong System z performance.
Over long periods of time, investment levels can improve margins, but given the market shifts and transformation we're driving, investments are currently reducing margins. Similarly, currency is typically neutral over an extended period, though our margin this quarter had a translational impact of the stronger dollar. With all of that, we drove margin improvement of 80 basis points.
The reported operating expense and other income is down 17%. The reported decline is driven by currency, a lower level of workforce rebalancing, and the fact that we no longer have the expense of the System x business in our run rate. I'll comment on each.
Eight points of decline was driven by currency, between the translation of non-dollar spending and the hedging gains that are reported in expense. Two points of the decline are due to the divestiture of System x. And we're continuing to rebalance our workforce, and this quarter, we took a charge of $280 million, but that's down $580 million year-to-year, so with a lower level of workforce rebalancing charges, drove another seven points of decline.
As we continue the transformation of our business, I'd expect a similar level of workforce rebalancing next quarter, which will impact our year-to-year profit performance. I should also mention that last year, we had nearly a $100 million gain from the sale of our customer care business and other income, which obviously wasn't replicated this year.
Within our base expense, we're continuing to shift resources and spending to areas where we see the most opportunity. In February, we talked about shifting $4 billion in spending in 2015, that's across expense, cost, and capital, and in the first quarter, we've been executing to that plan. We've increased expense in areas like SoftLayer, Watson, and Bluemix, just to name a few and we'll see the benefits over the longer term.
Now, let's turn to segments, and we'll start with Services. Combined Services revenue was $12.2 billion, which is down 2% year-to-year. This quarter, we closed 15 deals greater than $100 million, with about half of that for new clients or new scope with existing clients.
This reflects the strength of our offerings and our clients' confidence in our ability to manage the most critical assets in their business. We ended the quarter with total Services backlog of $121 billion, which was flat at constant currency and adjusting for the divestiture.
Global Technology Services delivered $7.9 billion of revenue. GTS Outsourcing reflects the mix and timing of contracts from the backlog. As expected, many of the larger contracts signed last year did not contribute to revenue in the first quarter.
We're continuing to see clients sign large infrastructure outsourcing deals with embedded cloud and mobile initiatives, creating large-scale hybrid IT environments. IBM is the trusted partner for these core business transformations because of our global capabilities and portfolio breadth. And in fact, the Forrester Research Wave evaluation cited IBM as far and away the leading supplier in the global infrastructure outsourcing segment.
Within ITS, we had good growth in cloud, security, and business resiliency, but overall performance was impacted by a shift away from lower-value services, such as data center build-outs and OEM hardware deployments.
Software grew solid double-digits this quarter, improving sequentially and building on the expanded data center capacity. We continued our steady progress with the opening of a few new footprints in Montreal, Sydney, and Amsterdam.
Clients like ShopDirect are choosing SoftLayer as the platform to integrate cloud initiatives with their core systems into a unified hybrid IT model. This architecture provides them with on-demand burst capability, as well as the ability to plan for and deliver consumer apparel and home goods, based on real-time demand. This kind of value is only unlocked when the emerging technologies like cloud and analytics are integrated with the large sets of customer data enterprises already have.
Maintenance was up 2%, with the growth driven by our multi-vendor support services, which is our third-party hardware maintenance offering. The continued growth of maintenance is another demonstration of the strength of our global reach and capabilities. As organizations expand, they want a partner who has scale and can provide global parts and support capabilities.
GTS pretax margin was driven by a few elements. Currency was the biggest impact to profit year-to-year and our maintenance profit was down due to the System x divestiture. Profit margin performance also reflects the continued investments in the business to expand our operational capabilities; the SoftLayer data center expansion I just mentioned is one example. This gives us a highly differentiated offering in hybrid cloud, especially as it relates to data residency requirements.
We're also increasing our sales hiring in our mobile and security practices, and making investments in our resiliency business. And we're accelerating our transition to a more significant global delivery model, which requires hiring and training costs ahead of the expected savings. Finally, we had a year-to-year benefit from a smaller workforce rebalancing charge in the quarter, but we haven’t yet realized the bulk of savings from our recent actions.
Global Business Services revenue was $4.3 billion. We’ve had solid performance in many markets and solution areas. In Japan we’ve been consistently growing revenue and expanding margins, with solid growth in consulting and application outsourcing. And in Europe this quarter we returned to revenue growth.
Across all our geographies, we continue to drive strong growth in the offerings that address our strategic imperatives. Our cloud solutions more than tripled year to year, analytics grew double digits, and we had very good growth in mobile and social. We’re helping clients create new business models and opportunities for client engagement.
The challenge for Global Business Services is North America. While we have solid growth in our strategic imperatives, we’re dealing with a slowdown in some of the more traditional areas. Because the U.S. is our largest geography, its performance has a significant impact on the overall segment.
But again, the U.S. has some very positive elements in GBS. Let me give you one example of the kind of work we’re doing to help clients create opportunities for client engagement. In February, we announced our strategic partnership with AMB Sports & Entertainment to transform the fan experience at the new Atlanta stadium.
When complete, when you go to the stadium, you’ll be able to see in real-time which parking lots are available and which are filled, where the shortest concession lines are during the game, and have access to statistics and information from the bleachers.
All because we can combine GTS outsourcing and technology capabilities with our GBS process and application expertise to provide a complete solution, creating new markets that didn’t exist even a few years ago.
Before wrapping up revenue, let me just remind you that we’ve integrated Global Process Services, our BPO business into GBS to create a seamless end-to-end business transformation capability for our clients and to better leverage our industry knowledge.
Looking at GBS profit, the pre-tax margin had a mix of drivers. We got some year-to-year benefit from the lower workforce rebalancing charge, and some savings yield from last year’s action. We were impacted by the Customer Care divestiture, both by the loss of operational profit and by not having a gain in this year’s results.
The balance of the margin decline was driven by our cost structure in those geographies where we’re not growing revenue. We’re making investments and taking actions to make our cost structure more competitive, including rebalancing to more global delivery, use of alternate labor models, and shifting resources toward higher-value Strategic Imperative offerings.
Our Software revenue of $5.2 billion was down 2%, a modest sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter. Key branded middleware grew one percent driven by growth in our Software-as-a-Service offerings, which were up nearly 50%. Total software growth reflects a one-point headwind from operating systems.
We had growth across many solution areas. Our analytics software was up, and our mobile software grew at a strong double-digit rate, led by our MobileFirst offerings. We had solid growth in our commerce solutions, where a large proportion of the business is Software-as-a-Service. And our Social solutions grew double-digits driven by strong performance in both Kenexa and advanced collaboration offerings. 
Across software, we’re continuing to drive innovation and capture growth areas importantly building our software into broader solution capabilities. Just this month, we have made two major announcements, IoT and Watson Health. These are a continuation of what we started last year with Watson, then earlier this year with analytics, commerce and security.
There are some common threads throughout. They are all based on a unique point of view around cloud and the value of hybrid. They all use analytics to leverage data. And they all have an industry dimension.
Let me comment briefly on the two announcements. At the end of March we announced the creation of an Internet of Things unit, committing $3 billion of spend over the next four years.
As part of this, we are establishing a cloud-based open platform to help clients and partners build and deliver vertical industry IoT solutions. We have also created an IoT zone within Bluemix, our platform-as-a-service and we are expanding an IoT ecosystem to leverage a growing developer and entrepreneur community.
This is similar to what we’ve done successfully around Watson, where we not only have large partners like Softbank in Japan, but we have hundreds of ecosystem partners you may not have heard of yet like Wayblazer, Fluid, Redant, MD Buyline, Elance, Sellpoint, SparkCognition, and LifeLearn, all of whom are building commercial applications on Watson.
And then last week we announced Watson Health, which we believe will transform healthcare, by bringing together the advanced cognitive capabilities of Watson with a vast ecosystem of partners, practitioners and researchers. There are several aspects to the Watson Health announcement, from the creation of a Watson Health Cloud, to partnerships with leading companies, to the acquisition of two companies that extend our healthcare analytics capabilities. 
These are the two most recent examples where we are partnering in new ways to drive innovation and build an ecosystem to transform industries.
Turning to our Systems Hardware segment, revenue of $1.7 billion was up 30%, as we continue to deliver innovation across our high end systems. This quarter System z MIPS were up 95% year to year, resulting in revenue more than doubling.
We started to ship our new z13 in the second week of March and this was the fastest start in terms of number of systems we shipped in over a decade. We also booked the highest revenue growth in any quarter in more than a decade. The capabilities of the z13 mainframe around mobile, cloud and real-time insights and fraud detection are resonating well with our customers.
Let me give you a real example of what we’re talking about. If you are UPS, one of the largest logistics companies in the world, you have to manage nearly 5 billion deliveries a year with highly seasonal changes in demand. Your customers expect their packages to arrive on time, and they expect to schedule, manage and track shipments anywhere, anytime, and increasingly through their mobile devices.
These mobile transactions can lead to dramatic increases in overall traffic as customers complete transactions at will. This requires a system that can handle the growth and scale seamlessly when activity spikes, maintaining a secure system that’s always available. That’s why UPS chose to upgrade to the IBM z13 mainframe because it could meet the expanding demands of the mobile economy.
Now moving on to Power, revenue returned to growth. We not only took share in the declining Unix market, but we are also expanding beyond Unix, with Linux on Power and our OpenPOWER IP opportunity.
We are expanding our customer base in the entry-level Linux systems as well as with large cloud-based players. The likes of OVH, the largest internet hosting company in Europe, Rackspace, and very recently Zuchetti, a leading IT provider in Italy, have all selected Power-based Linux systems to deliver their cloud offerings.
In addition, just over a year ago we launched the OpenPOWER Foundation, to open up the Power technology and build an ecosystem to share intellectual property. The ecosystem of partners includes large established players such as Google, Nvidia, Mellanox, Samsung, Tyan and Inspur. But the consortium includes other smaller and emerging players, such as SK Hynix from Korea, Teamsun from China and Nallatech from Scotland, adding tremendous breadth and reach.
Last month, the foundation unveiled more than ten new hardware innovations that continue to make Power technology relevant beyond the Unix market. And in the first quarter, we closed our first substantial intellectual property deal, a confirmation of our strategy on Power as an open chip processor.
This is an important step for the first OpenPOWER-based system for China. As an example, Zoom Netcom, a data communication and equipment supplier, will launch a system in the market later this year, which is based on the first derivative of a POWER chip unveiled by Suzhou PowerCore. This clearly shows that our Power strategy is working and we see momentum in the business.
Our Storage hardware revenue was down 2%, a modest sequential improvement. We again saw strong growth in our Flash Systems. This growth was offset by the wind down of our OEM business and continued price weakness in high-end disk.
We see value in the storage market shifting to software and in the first quarter we unveiled IBM Spectrum Storage, new storage software in support of hybrid cloud environments. The portfolio provides greater access to data, accelerates speed to insights and improves data economics.
Our Systems Hardware segment growth is a clear result of the actions we have taken to position our Systems business for the future. With good adoption in z13 and Power systems, and launch of the remaining P8 based systems later this quarter, we continue to see good growth in this business.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter, we generated $2 billion of cash from operations, excluding our Global Financing receivables. We spent just under a $1 billion in CapEx which is flat year to year, but includes a shift in spend as we build out our SoftLayer cloud centers. And so we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow, which is up $400 million year-to-year.
The primary driver was lower tax payments. This was partially offset by the working capital impact associated with the sale of our System x business, and higher payments for performance based comp which was accrued last year. I mentioned earlier that our free cash flow generation is skewed to the back end of the year, and we continue to expect to deliver on our full year objectives.
Looking at the uses of cash in the quarter, we returned over $2 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion in dividends and a $1.2 billion to buy back almost 8 million shares. At the end of March, we had 985 million shares outstanding and $5 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
With the flow through from last year’s share reduction, our first quarter spend, and the remaining
authorization, we can achieve the level of share reduction we’ve assumed in our model for the year.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $8.8 billion, which is up from December, but down from a year ago. Total debt was $38.8 billion, with over $26 billion in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7 to 1.
Our non-financing debt was $12.6 billion, which is down $3 billion from a year ago. Our non-financing debt-to-cap was essentially flat vs. December and four points higher than last year. Remember our equity was impacted in the latter half of last year by pension, currency and the semiconductor manufacturing divestiture.
The changes in book equity and the resulting impact on our debt-to-cap ratio do not adequately reflect the financial flexibility we have to support our business over the long term. In fact on the basis of a core debt to EBITDA metric, we are well positioned to support our long term growth objectives.
Finally, I want to mention that as a result of several court rulings in Spain, including one in March, we booked a $230 million pre-tax charge related to litigation involving IBM Spain retirement plans.
The court ruling reverses a voluntary employee program to join a defined contribution plan that was offered more than 20 years ago. This non-operating charge impacted GAAP earnings and pension liability in the first quarter. 
So now let me summarize the quarter, and talk about our full year expectations. We’ve been very clear that we’re transforming our business, and we continue to see signs that the transformation is working. In the first quarter you see it at the IBM level, and in our segments.
Our revenue trajectory improved, driven by an acceleration in our strategic imperatives. We had strength in high-end systems, as our new products address the most contemporary workloads of data, cloud and mobile.
This strength, together with our overall shift to higher value drove margin expansion for IBM. All together our revenue was flat year to year, excluding currency and the impact of divested businesses. And we had mid-single digit operating net income growth, and high single digit EPS growth as reported.
At the same time, we’ve made a number of bold moves that build on the momentum we started in 2014. These include our hybrid cloud announcement in February, a set of initiatives around Internet of Things in March, and just two weeks ago the launch of Watson Health. It was a good start to the year.
Looking forward, we’ll continue to deliver strong growth in our strategic imperatives, while the transitions in some of our businesses continue. We’ll continue to expand our margin as we shift to higher value, and we’ll continue a high level of investment, shifting to areas where we see the best opportunity.
We’re deploying capital through different models, organic R&D, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. And we’re building partnerships and ecosystems, not only with the big household names, but with hundreds of smaller firms. This leverages our mutual strengths and expands our reach, all at a high level of return. And of course we’ll continue to return value to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends. 
For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver Operating EPS of $15.75 to $16.50. And at that level of profit, we continue to expect free cash flow to be flat for the year. With these dynamics and level of performance, we’ll exit 2015 a higher-value business.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.
Operator, can you please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes. Thank you. Martin, I was wondering if could comment more broadly about progress in the transformation. Because if I kind of look at this very narrow-mindedly, hardware grew enormously. And if I take out hardware, the rest of the company grew at minus 2 which is what you've been doing the last couple of quarters.
And you commented that your strategic imperatives had actually accelerated in growth. So if we takeout hardware and the strategic imperatives are actually growing faster than before, doesn’t that suggest the core businesses outside of hardware and the strategic initiatives are actually getting worse.
And when we look at the gross margin profile of services and software which are 90% plus of your business, they actually got notably worse year-over-year even adjusting for the restructuring. So I would like to just maybe push back a little bit on -- beyond what we saw in hardware which I think is probably cyclical, what is the progress in the transformation.
And should we be thinking more like 30% growth rate in the strategic initiatives and that's sustainable on what drives it or perhaps you can just help us think through that.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Sure, Toni. Thanks for the question. Well, there is lot in that question. So, I will -- I will try to address it at a high level. First, in terms of the strategic imperatives continuing 30%, we are not thinking that this is a 30% strategic imperative growth every quarter now for the rest of the year as you know. 
And as we've talked about in Investor Day, they’ve been on a very steady 19%-20% growth rate year-to-year. Now they are a pretty substantial part of our business now and we view that 30% growth -- part of its driven obviously by the mainframe and power cycle. And we are thinking now when we look at the rest of the year that we are kind of accounting on a continued 19% to 20% growth.
So our guidance is not requiring 30% growth. In fact, we expect it to kind of return to what we've seen, still very strong growth, still ahead of the marketplace and still contributing a fair bit of growth to IBM. But think of it as more of a 20% growth. 
With the quarter, as we talked about on the call -- on the prepared remarks, outside the strategic imperatives we've been talking about that business in kind of a high single digit decline similar to the market that it sits in and we kind of saw that again in the first quarter. So the revenue dynamics in the first quarter were really a reflective of that acceleration, not a change in the core underneath that.
Couple of other points, I think that you are ready to. One, progress in the transformation, I think the transformation that is underway in the marketplace and is underway in our investment levels, is underway in our focus, continues at not only a very rapid pace, but a pace necessary for us to continue to lead in enterprise IT. So by this time last year we had created the Watson unit. We had identified a pretty substantial SoftLayer expansion plan that we rolled out throughout the year.
As a couple of examples, by this time this year, as you saw early in January we reformulated some of our business units to more directly engaged with clients the way they consume. So we have IBM Analytics, we have IBM Commerce. We have IBM security as examples. And so we got that done.
You saw earlier and I noted this in my prepared remarks we created an Internet of Things group which will build off of what we've done in Smarter Planet and Smarter Cities. Just recently we've created now the IBM Healthcare unit which will build off a couple of acquisitions as well as partnerships with some leading names in that space.
So the transformation continues at a very rapid pace. It continues a pace, again, necessary for us to maintaining our leadership in enterprise IT. But we are not building guidance around, again, that strategic imperative revenue continuing to growth at 30%. We are still thinking and kind of relying on that 20% growth rate that we've been able to deliver the last five years. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Toni. Let’s go to the next question please Dory. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan.
Tien-Tsin Huang
Hey, thanks. Just want to ask on the services side, how that came in both in revenue and margin versus plan. Seem like with mostly done with the heavy workforce rebalancing, heard little bit about China make shifting way from the lower margins from GTS being little bit weak. But seems like we could assume certainly better performance starting in 2Q, can you maybe expand on that Martin?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Tien-Tsin. Thanks. So a couple of things. One, we did see a deceleration in GTS in the first quarter in Global Technology Services. But keep in mind that when we had these pretty substantial transactions and new relationships that we signed last year. Those will only move into the run phase over the next few quarters, primarily in the second half. So we would expect those to contribute bit more or something in fact, they didn’t contribute anything in the first quarter. But they will start to contribute in the Global Technology Services.
Margins within Global Technology Services will continue to reflect the currency environment we’re in as well as the investments we are making in order to grow out our SoftLayer platform and to shift the business to these new higher areas. 
As you noted on our prepared remarks we talked about shifting away from lower margin offering in some of our site facilities business and redeploying that and that will continue. So from a Global Technology Services perspective between the currency environment that we are in and the shift we are making, and the investments we are making, we are not relying on dramatic growth or margin improvement in GTS in our guidance. 
On GBS, we've got some very strong results, continued strong results in Japan and in Europe. And we continue to shift that business as well into these new areas where we are comfortable that the margin profile there will be consistent with our guidance also, so two different stories between GTS and GBS within our guidance. We are not relying on dramatic growth here. But we will see some improved performance coming out of the backlog because of the big deals we signed last year.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Tien-Tsin. Can we go to the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. 
David Grossman
Thank you. Martin, I wondered if we could just look in little more detail for software business. The compares get much easier in the back half of the year. And based somewhat you are seeing in the business today and if there is no material shifts in the economic backdrop.
Would these comps be enough to stabilize the software segment on its own or is it possible that growth could remain negative given all those different things you talked about in the back half of the year even against the negative comps that we see versus last year in the back half of the year?
Martin Schroeter
Sure David. Thanks. So software, as we talked about when we provided guidance initially back in January, we said we still feel this way. The difference in our low end of our guidance and our high end of our guidance really depends on the trajectory of software. What we saw in the first quarter was a one point improvement in the trajectory, not back yet to growth, but a one point improvement in our trajectory.
Now that's not all year. We haven’t seen it yet all years. But again, the difference high and low guidance is that trajectory improvement. Assuming we were at the same level, same trajectory we had last year, we said that's kind of the low end of our guidance.
We do see an environment where that's kind of the trajectory performance that we can rely on, if you will. We continue to sign ELAs with clients. We signed 200 ELAs again in the first quarter. We continue to have an impact in our growth from the operating system component of software.
But we saw pretty good uptake in our as a service offerings which are driving growth of more than 50%. And at the same time our clients with their reduced visibility continue to look for flexibility in our offerings for those who have deployed the most. 
So software again represents for us the difference between the low end and the high end of our guidance. We saw that one quarter sequential improvement in the first and we see how we go for the rest of the year. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks David. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS.
Steve Milunovich
Thank you. Martin, would you be able to share with us the EPS impact on currency. You gave us revenue, but could you tell us cents per share? And then I was curious on the free cash flow you gave us flat for the year, could you talk a bit about the plus and minus factors that you've got there, CapEx, cash taxes and so forth and how those are going to play out?
Martin Schroeter
Of course. And since currency and free cash flow are so related we will count that as a one part question, Steve.
Steve Milunovich
Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
So, first on currency. We did talk -- as we mentioned in the call, currency was an impact of about eight points on the revenue line. So a bit over a $1.7 billion in terms of translating the first quarter revenue back to dollars and we saw some significant movements not only since January, but also even since we provided an impact on the day of our Investor Day, so a pretty big impact on the revenue line.
From a profit perspective, now, this is somewhat of an imprecise calculation, right? It is not knowable. It is unknowable number. We can estimate it. But we think their profit growth was impacted year-to-year by somewhere between $0.15 and $0.20 in the quarter. That's a pretty big impact. So, obviously, that shows up in margin. And that first quarter impact then given where the dollar is now, you could adjust. We are working to try to -- we will obviously have to manage our way through this. But if you just took that $0.15 to $0.20 impact at the high end assuming the rates stay here, you could see an $0.80 year-to-year impact full year on earnings from this, again, without us having done anything. So, obviously, it’s something we are thinking about and working on pretty hard. 
In terms of free cash flow, we said relatively flat year-to-year in full year. The bridge items are not dissimilar or not going to surprise you. First, we do see cash taxes this year being better year-to-year than they were last year. So that's probably about $2 billion better year-to-year, so that will certainly help. 
Reducing that on a full year basis though, will be increased CapEx investments which we'll be making. We've talked about that already in January and we mentioned again in Investor Day. We also have while we expect a lower level of workforce rebalancing charges, the timing of those, the cash impact of those is likely to lead to an increase this year relative to last year of about $0.5 billion. 
And then our performance related cash payments this year for prior year accruals will probably be up $700 million to $800 million as well. So outside of that, our cash performance will look a lot like our income performance which is kind of what you would expect I think.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Steve. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Yes. Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope
Okay. Thanks. I have a question on the mainframe site. If you are only shipping the new mainframes in the last few weeks of the quarter and you were able to double revenue. Should we assume that we still have some potential for growth to accelerate from here?
And then I guess just looking at the cycle overall, can you talk about whether there are any unique financial dynamics for this cycle that we should consider relative to last few cycles. I guess, I'm particularly focused on the dynamics around pricing where it looks like you actually had an ASP tailwind relative to MIPS growth this quarter and also the pull through for as-a-service on this platform. Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Bill. Few things on the mainframe. So first, we had a terrific first quarter in the mainframe. But I think it’s important to understand two elements of this, first, this is what we expected our mainframe performance to be. This was not a surprise to us. And so I don’t think that you should take away from either our prepared remarks or even the questions that we think we did better than we would have. We think this was the mainframe performance we expected very clearly.
I think that the element for the mainframe, though, that are most widely misunderstood by many who follow us are twofold. One -- and this has to do with the timing of what you’re seeing in the quarter. One, I don’t that mainframe is fully appreciated for the essential nature of the work it does for the impact that our clients feel from an upgraded mainframe and for the kinds of enterprise class saleable workloads that it drives.
So we used the example of UPS in the call, 5 billion packages they have to deliver on time and again they can't be down. So, one, I think there is an under appreciation for the mainframe and its value to our clients.
Two, I think there is a huge difference, obviously between how consumer technology works and how enterprise technology works. And so when you read that we were shipping the mainframe since March, remember, we've been having the discussions with about 60 of our clients for months and months and months, because they help us build and design this for their needs in those enterprise spaces.
But the January announcement is when we start building the value propositions for our clients, and so the work for the sales teams begin in January. The fact that it was only shipped in March really only means that our supply chain, our fulfillment teams did a phenomenal job in a relatively short period of time to get fulfill the demand that we saw within the quarter. 
But from an enterprise buying cycle, I think, you really do have to understand that these are built our clients. These are -- we discuss the value prop with our clients before that March date, that’s not as critical a date as you might think if -- again, if you are thinking about it from a consumer side. 
From a first quarter perspective, as I mentioned, we are very pleased with how it did. But it didn’t surprise us. And as we've talked about in the past, the second quarter tends to be the largest quarter for mainframe and we still see that in this quarter as well. So we had very good quarter in the first. We would expect that the mainframe will be the larger in the second than it was in the first. But keep in mind now you will get into compare issues. Right?
So from a dollar perspective it will be larger. But we also had a great mainframe quarter second quarter last year. So the growth year-to-year will look a lot different than the first quarter, but the absolute number in the second will be higher.
We would expect that in the first half, we'll probably finish at solid 50% growth in the mainframe between the first two quarters, which is very typical, very traditional, in terms of the mainframe.
From a margin perspective, as you noted, with MIPS only going up 95%, I say only with a smirk -- with MIPS going of 95% and revenue up 130% on a constant currency basis, yeah, there's obviously a lot of value that our clients see here and a lot of value for the IBM Corporation. So, we are delighted with how well the mainframe did, but it wasn't as apprised was. It's a powerful, powerful platform for the world's business.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Bill. Can go to the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, thank you. Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Brian White
Yeah Martin, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how customers are feeling in the broad IT spending environment. It seems like financials and first quarter were actually very strong and a huge FX impact. So, I'm just curious how customers are feeling and how we should think about general seasonality throughout the year?
Martin Schroeter
For us, Brian, I think couple of things. One, we have not seen a dramatic shift in trajectory across lot of our sectors. Financial services sector is obviously one where the mainframe plays a pretty vital role in how the world banks run and when you get a new mainframe, particularly when so relevant to them shifting their business into mobile, particularly one where counter fraud is such an important part of what they have to think about every day.
And again you need scalability, you need reliability. You have to run all the time. That, as a particular, that new mainframe as an emphasis within financial services sec are, and therefore we did see an improvement in the trajectory in financial services.
But across the rest, I would say not a dramatic shift in what we saw in the first quarter. Again, the common thread that we're seeing is not a sector-by-sector other than what I pointed out in the financial services. The common thread here is the relevance of our offering in the strategic imperatives where the need for mobility, the need for social ways of engaging either your employee base, your client base and the need for really powerful scalable systems kind of drove the day in the first quarter with 30% growth year-to-year relative to what had been a 20% kind of growing business.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Brian. Dory can we take the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman
Hi, Martin, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to cash flow, if I could. In your past comments, you talked about this year being flat, but previously called out a number of one-time items including pensions. And I was just wondering if you could comment directionally how we should be envisioning cash flow in 2016 relative to 2015. It seems like some of the items should be one-time in nature, but the tax payments, restructuring, et cetera, been both directionally and relative to the percent that you normally provide versus net income.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. A few things, Keith. One, as we said a number of times, cash flow, we expect to be flat in 2015, relative to 2014. And relative to 2014, what we showed in Investor Day were the drivers of our realization and 2014, were really two-fold.
One, we had a very high cash tax rate last year relative to net income and as I mentioned in the prior answer, we don't see that same level of headwinds this year. So, on a realization basis, taxes -- cash taxes will not be an impact to 2015. I'll come back to 2016 in a moment.
And then all so last year, we had a pretty substantial gain, which obviously showed up as cash in the IBM Corporation, but showed up in the investing line not in the free cash flow line so that drove realization down about 20 points from the -- say if we set ourselves high 90s.
So, this year, as I mentioned, we don't the cash taxes as a primary headwind and we do expect to improve realization this year pretty dramatically. I did talk about, a little bit, on a full-year basis about some of the differences in cash flows this year including performance related payments and workforce rebalancing payments and increased CapEx within 2015, but still an improvement in our realization rate in 2015.
Now, when we get to 2016, I think a few things happen. One, we again will have, I think, the cash tax headwind. Now this is at a planning level and we're nine months away from the start of the year, which means we're 21 months away from figuring out the settlement of audits and things. So, we've got a long way to go, but right now, we would envision a cash tax headwind again in 2016 that we can see.
From a pension perspective, we're kind of -- we're in our pensions by the way. We've been -- we have a closed pension and we've been moving our asset side of our portfolio to more mimics the liability side, which is we've been moving to more debt instruments within that and allocating to more interest rate securities.
So, we don't have as much risk in the portfolio and our U.S. pension remains very well-funded and our global pensions are in a pretty good funding position, so we don't see a lot of -- at this point, we don't see a lot of impact from pensions.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Keith. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner
Hi. Thanks. Martin, I was hoping you could walk through your expectations for profitability as we move through the year? It looks like from a profitability perspective on a year-over-year basis, services and software declined a bit but hardware was more profitable. Hoping you could walk us through the rest of the year. Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Let's -- I'll talk about how we see the rest of the year playing out, first in -- from a full-year perspective and then I'll bring it to the near-term and what we see coming in the second quarter.
So, first, as I mentioned earlier, our low end of guidance assumes, essentially, that software doesn't improve for the rest of the year and as we already saw that first quarter was just a bit of head of that, so the high end of guidance assumes – as we see a slight trajectory improvement in our software business right back to essentially flat.
In the near-term -- so that's the difference between high and low -- the near-term, from a profitability perspective, we have a fairly typical skew in our pretax profit from first to second quarter. It's fairly typical.
Now, as we transform our business, as we continue to make investments, as we continue to see growth in our strategic imperatives business, we will get, as I mentioned another good quarter out of the mainframe. But as we transform that business, I would expect to see a fairly typical skew from first to second quarter on a pretax profit basis.
Now, on a year-to-year basis we have dynamics within our workforce rebalancing charges from prior years that drive the growth rates to look at odd. So, with essentially roughly the same level of workforce rebalancing from first quarter to second quarter this year, we take that out of the equation, therefore, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but the transformation of our business and the cycle we are in the mainframe, I think, probably gets us to a typical -- a more typical, if you will, sequential improvement of about $1 billion of pretax profit quarter-to-quarter. And again, on a full-year basis, we see the difference in the high end and the low end of being that software trajectory.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Sherri. Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes, thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Martin, could you talk about any changes in IT spending demand trends, especially in regions where there were significant effects, double the factor at all in terms of any deferrals?
And can you help us think through how the expense levels will change with FX relative to the revenue levels as we go through the year. This quarter they were in pretty good alignment, but you also saw a pretty strong America's revenue. So, just wondering what the puts and takes there could be.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, I mean I'd say a few things. So, we did not see dramatic -- we didn't see any improvement in, for instance, in Asia-Pacific. So, we continue to see a slow spending environment in AP and I think our performance there mimics what we're seeing in the marketplace in general.
Japan, spending continues to go quite well and we continue to perform. But it's more than just the environment in Japan. The team has done a terrific job of maintaining growth now well into their third year and so it’s the strength of our offerings that are underpinned by a reasonable spending environment within Japan.
In other places, as we noted on the call, North America, U.S. did quite well and we see a spending environment there that is supportive of the investments we're making in the way we are shifting the business.
So, in total, with some exceptions where we see weak spending environment in AP, we see a reasonable environment. Now, from an expense perspective, our focus is obviously on continuing to drive that in those investment levels and as we talked about in the prepared remarks, outside of the translation impact of currency and outside of the divested content, our spending was essentially flat year-to-year.
And so on an EDR basis, that was about the same and we will continue to shift within that our spending toward the strategic imperatives. And so, when you look at 30% growth and again, we don't expect it to stay at 30 -- but when you look at 30% growth that supported by a pretty dramatic shift of spending within IBM and at the same time, that funding, that spending is coming from those core businesses. So, some of what you're seeing in that core business decline is that engineered shift toward the strategic imperatives.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Wamsi. Dory, let's take one last question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Jim Suva with Citi.
Jim Suva
Thank you very much. And if you can focus a little bit on the Services segment. Help us understand kind of what's going on there. It looks like both GBS and GTS profitability is down year-over-year and the signings have a lot of volatility around them.
But kind of the rate of $10 billion seems to be a multi-year low. How should we kind of think about what's going on in services, mostly the shift to the strategic imperatives and how should we kind of think about that. Could it be the shift we would expect profitability to actually be up year-over-year, or maybe it's FX? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, so a few things. And you're right; FX is obviously playing a role here in how some of those services profits translate back to U.S. dollars. But on a broader context, signings growth in the first quarter, which is there plenty of opportunity out there? There certainly is.
We see a lot of opportunity for continued growth in our outsourcing business, double-digit growth, in fact, across all our outsourcing businesses and signings. And the backlog, in total, was essentially flat year-to-year. Obviously, there is a currency impact here on the divestiture impact, but backlog in total was essentially flat.
What we see and services is really a couple of things. One, within Global Technology Services, we continue to invest pretty heavily, as I noted earlier, in order to drive that SoftLayer platform, for instance. We continue to invest to build out that infrastructure as-a-Service capability where we're seeing very good growth in our SoftLayer platform and very good growth across cloud.
In the GBS business, we're seeing very good performance in Japan. We got a return to growth in Europe, which was quite encouraging and there are some areas of strength in other parts of those emerging market. Latin America did quite well, doing well in the Middle East and Africa. What we are seeing is the slowdown that's driving the revenue line in the U.S.
Now, some of that's driven by consulting. But quite frankly, now, we did grow our signings again in the U.S. So, we have -- we're building, if you will, a backlog that will turn into revenue in the future. But right now, we're dealing with the slowdown in our U.S. consulting business.
The mix of our business in GBS is pretty consistent around the world. They have a very high mix of the strategic imperatives. And within that mix, the growth is very high. So, we're comfortable that we're making the shift in GBS. We obviously have, as I noted, some work to do in our U.S. business. But we do see good -- some pretty good growth and pretty good performance in other parts of the world in GBS.
Martin Schroeter
So, I wanted to wrap up the call just with a few points. And again, to thank you for joining this afternoon. Our first quarter performance, we view as another proof point that the strategy is right, the actions we're taking to reinvent our businesses, the innovation we're delivering in our hardware business and our software business and in our services businesses, is starting to pay off and the investments and the focus on those solution areas are all contributing to the very strong growth we saw in the strategic imperatives.
So, as we move through the year, we'll continue the transformation. We'll continue to make these investments and to build those ecosystems that we talked about. It certainly takes some time. But, certainly this was a very good start to the year. So, thanks for joining.

Martin Schroeter
Thanks Patricia. Today I will start with a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year performance, review the details of the quarter and wrap up with a discussion of 2014 and expectations for 2015.
Our strategy is focused on leading in the areas where we see the most value in enterprise IT and in 2014 we made tremendous progress in repositioning the portfolio and making investment to shift into these areas. Our results reflect all of that.
In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $24.1 billion, net income of $5.8 billion, free cash flow of $6.6 billion and operating earnings per share of $5.81. Our total revenue performance reflects the divestitures of System x and Customer Care, which together had $1.6 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 and we had about a $1.2 billion impact from currency movements. So combined, this represents about $2.8 billion of revenue or a 10 point impact to the reported revenue growth rate.
That currency impact was even greater than spot rates suggested 90 days ago, excluding the impact of currency and divestitures, our total revenue was in line with our expectations.
We once again had strong performance in our strategic imperatives that address the market shifts in data, cloud and engagement. Together, they posted double-digit growth as they did in every quarter of 2014.
We had solid improvement in gross and pretax margin as we drive our overall business to higher value. That will certainly continue into this year as we benefit from the recent portfolio actions and we are continuing to shift our investments and resources to our strategic imperatives and solutions that address our clients most critical issues.
Looking at the full year from a financial perspective, we delivered $21 billion of pretax income and operating earnings per share of $16.53. We generated about $12.5 billion of free cash flow, paid out over $4 billion in dividends and reduced our average share count by over 8%, while reducing our core debt by $0.5 billion.
Our strategic imperatives continue to drive strong growth, up 16% in 2014 and that includes an impact from currency. Together, cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security generated $25 billion in revenue, which is 27% of IBM.
Analytics was up 7% on a large base and with 60% revenue growth, our cloud business is substantial. It's now $7 billion in revenue and we exited the year with an annual as a service run rate of $3.5 billion. That's up from $2.2 billion a year ago.
During the year, we once again spent 6% of our revenue in research and development, and invested about $4 billion on capital, supporting actions in a number of areas that will yield financial benefits in future years. Let me mention a few.
We introduced our cloud platform-as-a-service Bluemix and are shifting capital to globally expand our SoftLayer Cloud Data Centers. We're bringing Watson’s capabilities to the enterprise and building a partner ecosystem, effectively creating a market for cognitive computing.
We introduced cloud application innovations around Watson Analytics and Verse. We launched POWER8 and are building the OpenPOWER consortium. We formed a partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility with twitter for big data and with SAP and Tencent for cloud. Clearly, we are the go-to platform for the enterprise.
In 2014, we divested large businesses that no longer fit our strategic profile, System x and customer care BPO and announced the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing business. These three businesses drove $7 billion of revenue in 2013 but lost about $0.5 billion of pretax profit.
While we certainly have a smaller business in terms of revenue and of course, the divestitures reduced the number of employees, it is a higher value, higher margin business.
Within that, we are continuing to remix our skills and as an example, we had over 45,000 hires in 2014 adding to our capabilities in our strategic areas. So we got a lot done in 2014 that positions us for the longer term, I will talk more about the full year and what it means for 2015 after going through the details of the quarter.
But now let me get into the fourth quarter results. These are all operating results, which are based on continuing operations. We delivered $5.8 billion of operating net income on revenue of $24.1 billion.
Revenue was down 12%, but as I just said, that includes about 10 points of impact from currency and divestitures. So we were down 2% at constant currency excluding the divested businesses. On net basis, services revenue was flat, our software segment declined 3% and systems and technology revenue was down 12%.
We have seen significant strengthening of the dollars since September. Currency impacted our revenue performance by about 4.5 points or $1.2 billion. This is a 1.5 of growth or $400 million more than anticipated based on spot rates 90 days ago.
Our gross margin was up 60 basis points driven by improvements in GBS and a mix away from the low-margin System x business. Pretax margin was up 3 points this quarter. PTI includes the gain from the sale of System x, which net of related transaction and performance-based costs was $1.1 billion, as well as nearly $600 million of workforce rebalancing charges.
We had a substantial tax headwind in the fourth quarter. Last year, our rate included the benefit associated with the settlement of the U.S. tax audit and as a result, our tax rate is up nearly 10 points over last year.
On the bottomline, we reported operating EPS of $5.81. Looking at our free cash flow, we generated $6.6 billion in the quarter, which is more than half of the full year. We ended the year with $8.5 billion of cash on hand.
Now turning to the revenue by geography because of the geography mix of the System x business, the divestiture impacted major markets growth by 4 points and growth markets by 9 points. So I’ll focus on year-to-year performance at constant currency and adjusting for the divested businesses in all periods. On this basis, both major markets and growth markets were down 2%.
Within major markets, we had growth in Japan while North America and Europe declined. Europe’s performance improved from last quarter with improvements in the U.K. and Italy and continued growth in Spain. Our North America revenue was down driven by declines in global business services, the signings grew for the second consecutive quarter.
Our growth markets year-to-year performance improved nearly 2 points from last quarter. This was driven by China which was down 1% this quarter. The improvement in the year-to-year trajectory was driven by strong software performance and several large mainframe transactions. In fact, four of our five largest banking clients in China added substantial new mainframe capacity. Overall BRIC performance was consistent with last quarter with the improvement in China offset by weaker performance in Brazil.
Turning to the segment perspective, our total services revenue was flat at constant currency, adjusting for the divested businesses. On that base, GTS was up 2% and we had growth across all business lines, outsourcing, integrated technology services and maintenance.
Global Business Services revenue was down with significant growth in the strategic imperatives offset by weakness in some of the more traditional application areas. In software, we had good growth in key areas like security, cloud and mobile but our software customers continue to utilize the flexibility we’ve provided impacting transaction revenue growth and weakness in operating systems. System’s performance reflects the end-of-the-product cycle in our System z mainframe, and declines in power and storage though both had modest sequential improvement in year-to-year performance.
Our gross profit margin was nearly 54%, that’s up 60 basis points from last year. We had solid improvement in GBS as we mixed toward the higher-margin strategic imperatives. The GTS margin is relatively flat even with an impact from the divestiture of System x maintenance.
Software continued to have a very strong margin at 90%. And we had significant margin improvement in systems, driven by the divestiture of the lower margin System x business so our focus on moving to higher value spaces is showing up in our gross margin.
The reported total operating expense and other income reflects not only the ongoing run rate of the business but also the impact of the System x divestiture and the charge for workforce rebalancing. In total, the reported level of expense is down 20% though the entire decline is driven by the combination of the System x gain and the fact that we no longer have the expense for the System x business in our run rate.
Normalizing for the System x divestiture, our expense and other income would have been up about 2% or about 6% adjusted for currency and acquisitions. You'll recall last October I told you that we expected to take a charge for workforce rebalancing in the fourth quarter. SG&A includes the workforce rebalancing charge of about $580 million, nearly all of which is a year-to-year increase. Within our base expense, we’re continuing to shift resources in spending to areas where we see the most opportunity, including Watson, SoftLayer, BlueMix and in support of our Apple partnership.
Finally, I want to spend a minute on the impact of currency. The dramatic dollar strengthening started in September and has continued at a rapid pace. In addition, the currencies have nearly all moved in an unfavorable direction for our business profile. The result is an impact to our revenue and our earnings.
We hedge a portion of our cross border cash flows, which defers the impact of the currency movement but it doesn't eliminate it. Our hedges are designed to provide the stability around the receipt of cash. But there is no year-to-year benefit in the income statement when a currency's direction is sustained over a longer period and that’s what we've been dealing with.
Looking at the fourth quarter, we estimate the impact to our profit growth was nearly $300 million. At current spot rates, we would expect a significant impact to revenue and profit in 2015. The chart at the back of our presentation sizes the revenue impact at current spot rates.
Now let’s turn to the segments and we'll start with services. Our total services backlog was $128 billion when adjusted for currency and the customer care and System x divestitures, it was flat year-to-year. This is an improvement from the 2% decline we reported in the third quarter on that same basis.
The sequential backlog improvement was driven by several significant new outsourcing contracts closed in the period. As a result, outsourcing backlog returned to growth and was up 1% at constant currency, adjusted for the customer care divestiture.
The combined services revenue was $13.5 billion dollars, which is flat year-to-year at constant currency adjusting for the divestitures. Revenue for Global Technology Services was $9.2 billion, up 2% at constant currency adjusted for the divestitures. GTS outsourcing was up 1% at constant currency for the quarter and for the year adjusted for the customer care divestiture.
Clients are continuing to sign large outsourcing engagements that leverage our cloud, business analytics and mobile solutions. Clients are using these outsourcing engagements as ways to optimize their IT infrastructure while at the same time, enabling new services to their customers. Lufthansa and ABN AMRO, both of which were over a $1 billion in contract value are great recent examples of this.
ITS revenue was up 4% at constant currency, driven largely by our high-value security, mobility and resiliency offerings. SoftLayer continues to attract new workloads to the platform. And in October, we announced IBM was selected by SAP to be their global cloud provider for their enterprise cloud solution.
IBM's ability to integrate public and private workloads within our hybrid cloud was a critical differentiator for SAP. We continue to expand our data center footprint. And in the fourth quarter, we opened cloud centers in Melbourne, Paris, Mexico City, Tokyo and Frankfurt.
Maintenance was up 1% when adjusted for currency and the impact from the System x divestiture. GTS pretax profit was down significantly in the quarter. Year-to-year performance was driven by several key factors.
First, we have the loss of year-to-year profit resulting from the customer care and System x divestitures. Second, we took a workforce rebalancing charge in the quarter, which impacts profit. Finally we’re continuing to invest in both offerings and operational capabilities that includes targeted investments in mobility, security and cloud which complement our client systems of record as well as operational improvements such as the savings yield from the rebalancing action we took earlier this year and more broadly deployed automation in the delivery centers.
Overall the profit performance in GTS reflects the actions we've taken to transform the business this year. We've invested in our strategic imperatives to accelerate growth. We’ve continued to optimize our delivery platform through the workforce rebalancing and broader use of automation and we’ve divested businesses, impacting our year-to-year results.
While those actions all have near-term impacts to profit, they better position us going forward and enable us to deliver more value to clients. Global Business Services revenue was $4.3 billion, down 3% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration declined 3% at constant currency.
Revenue was down in our traditional back-office implementations, particularly in North America. We again had strong double-digit growth in our practices that address cloud, analytics, mobile and social.
Through our Apple partnership, we released the first 10 MobileFirst for iOS solutions in the fourth quarter, with more to come by the end of this quarter focused in Healthcare, Energy and Utilities. We’ve seen strong customer interest and this partnership is another example of how we're helping enterprise clients to transform their business models and sources of value.
Application outsourcing was down 2% at constant currency, reflecting sequential year-to-year improvement but we still see a challenging pricing environment.
GBS gross margin expanded roughly 1.5 year-to-year which is a good indicator of the value our offerings deliver. Pretax profit declined, including a 15-point impact from the workforce rebalancing charge which will pay back in 2015.
We continue to see a slowdown in back-office implementations in the traditional parts of the portfolio. We are investing in strategic partnerships and those will pay off in 2015 as well.
To wrap up GBS, we've integrated Global Process Services, our BPO business, with GBS to create a seamless end-to-end business transformation capability for our clients. Starting in the first quarter, our reporting will reflect this shift of GPS from our Global Technology Services segment to GBS.
Software revenue of $7.6 billion was down 3% at constant currency. After the third quarter, we said we didn't expect a change in trajectory in the fourth and our fourth quarter performance was fairly similar to the third. Total software growth reflects a headwind from operating systems, driven by the divestiture of System x and our Power results.
It also reflects business model changes, which impacted our transaction revenue growth as our customers continue to use the flexibility we have provided in the deployment of software purchased through enterprise licensing agreements. The flexibility enables clients to optimize their capacity on our platform for the long-term.
We had solid growth in many of our solution areas, including security, mobile and cloud. Our security software once again grew at a double-digit rate. In fact, this was the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Cybersecurity threats are one of the key issues that all our customers are facing. We have brought our analytics, big data, research IP, mobile and cloud capabilities to create security offerings to address this market opportunity.
Our software mobile offerings more than doubled in the quarter, as we leveraged our integrated MobileFirst portfolio, and our Software-As-A-Service offerings are up nearly 50%. Across software, we continue to drive innovation and capture growth areas. We are integrating analytics and security capabilities that are needed to operate seamlessly in a hybrid environment.
For example, we are introducing several new offerings that further enable our analytics portfolio in a cloud environment. And we recently announced IBM Verse, a cloud-based email and collaboration offering that integrates Watson capabilities. This type of continued innovation in our offerings, together with expanding services on our Bluemix platform-as-a-service, will allow our customers to move to a hybrid environment.
Systems and Technology revenue of $2.4 billion was down 12% at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture of our System x business. Last January, our Systems and Technology business had just reported a $1.7 billion year-to-year profit decline for 2013 and we said we’d stabilize the profit on a go-forward basis. I'm pleased to say that after a lot of work to reposition the business, we have stabilized the profit.
Looking at our fourth quarter results, Systems z revenue was down 23% at constant currency, reflecting the fact that we are in the tenth and final quarter of this product cycle. Our last 10-quarter cycle was z10. Comparing the current cycle to that of z10, program-to-date System z revenue and gross profit is right on top of that cycle.
We continue to innovate on the platform and last week, we announced z13, the new generation of the IBM Mainframe. The z13 system culminates a billion dollar investment, five years of development, exploits the innovation of more than 500 new patents and represents a collaboration with more than 60 clients. The result of this innovation is a Mainframe that has the world's fastest processor that can execute two and a half billion transactions a day.
With this generation of Mainframe, we've dramatically enhanced the capabilities around analytics, mobile, security and cloud to address the needs our clients see in their businesses. These capabilities span from real-time insights to real-time fraud detection in a system that can consistently run at 100% utilization with 100% uptime. IBM continues to innovate on the platform to address client needs and extend its leadership in high-end systems, a core franchise that has nearly doubled in installed capacity over the last five years.
Power revenue declined 11% at constant currency, which is a modest sequential improvement in year-to-year performance. We have repositioned Power, which is now a systems business, as well as an open chip processor and an IP opportunity through the OpenPOWER foundation.
We saw double-digit growth in the low-end, driven by entry-level POWER8-based system. And in the fourth quarter, we introduced our high-end Power 8 enterprise systems. OpenPOWER foundation membership continues to expand, which started in 2014 with five members and now stands at over 80, 14 of which are in Greater China.
Since the establishment of the consortium a year ago, several products have been introduced. For example, on the scale out systems, Tyan launched the first OpenPOWER customer references and on the high-end, the U.S. Department of Energy recently awarded IBM a $350 million contract to create future super-computers based on OpenPOWER technology.
In addition, we've initiated a strategic partnership with Suzhou PowerCore, which intends to use POWER architecture to develop and market processors for servers in China. Our Storage hardware revenue was down 5% at constant currency, a modest sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter. We again saw strong growth in our FlashSystems and Storwize portfolio.
This growth was offset by the wind down of our legacy OEM business and continued weakness in high-end disk. Recently IDC reported that IBM was the leader in all-flash systems shipped capacity during the first half of 2014, outpacing the number two and number three competitors combined.
Over the course of the year, we took significant actions to reposition our Systems and Technology business for higher value and reinforced our commitment to driving innovation in our high-end systems and storage. We repositioned Power through creation of our Power 8 systems which are built for cloud and big data and made available the POWER8 architecture through the OpenPOWER consortium to build an open ecosystem and an IP play.
We are divesting our microelectronics manufacturing, with future chip supply coming from an at-scale provider. And we committed $3 billion of investment in the next era of chip technology, as we strengthen our semiconductor R&D and systems innovation. We also divested System x, our low-end server business.
And as I mentioned, just last week we announced z13, the new generation of the mainframe. Our Systems and Technology segment grew profit in the fourth quarter and was profitable for the year. With our portfolio repositioned and introduction of the new mainframe, we should now see profit leverage.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter, we generated $7.6 billion of cash from operations, excluding our Global Financing receivables. We invested a billion dollars in capital expenditures and we generated $6.6 billion in free cash flow, which was up $4.4 billion quarter-to quarter but down $1.8 billion year-to-year.
As I said earlier, we generated more than half of our annual cash flow in the fourth quarter, in line with our average over the last five years. For the full year, our cash from operations excluding GF receivables was $16.2 billion. We invested almost $4 billion in capital expenditures, with consistent spend throughout the year. And within that we shifted significant spend to strategic areas such as SoftLayer and Watson.
So, our free cash flow was $12.4 billion, down $2.6 billion year-to-year. The bulk of that was driven by an increase in cash tax payments and working capital impacts associated with the System x divestiture. While not in free cash flow, we received proceeds of $2.4 billion from divestitures, including the System x and Customer Care business.
As for the uses of free cash flow for the year, we acquired six companies. We paid $4.3 billion in dividends and bought back almost 72 million shares, reducing our average share count by 8%.
Let me comment on our share repurchase activity over time. Since the beginning of our share repurchase program in 1995, we've taken or share count from roughly 2.35 billion shares to fewer than 1 billion shares, that’s reduction of 58% program to date at an average purchase price of less than $100 per share. At the end of the year, we had $6.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $8.5 billion. Our total assets reflect a year-to-year reduction associated with the semiconductor transaction, as well as a reduction in our pension assets. We had strong returns on our pension assets, above the long-term expected return assumption. The asset decline was driven by a year-end re-measurement of liability. I will address that in a minute.
Total debt was $40.8 billion, of which $29.1 billion was in support of our financing business. The global financing leverage at year end was 7.2 to 1, consistent with last December. Our total debt was down almost $5 billion since September and up $1.1 billion in the last year. Our non-financing debt drove the quarter-to-quarter decline. At $11.7 billion, it was down $5.4 billion since September and down $0.5 billion year to year.
Let me put our current non-financing, or our core debt level in perspective. In May of 2007, we re-introduced debt to our core capital structure and in June of that year, we had $11.8 billion of core debt. So while our debt level has varied over time, it's at the same level as when we introduced debt to our structure.
Looking at debt-to-cap, we improved our ratio since September, though not as much as expected. We reduced debt levels and profit performance increased equity, both as we expected. However, our debt-to-cap ratio was impacted by a $7 billion reduction in equity since September due to currency and pension.
A $1 billion of the equity hit was due to currency translation, and over $6 billion for pension re-measurement driven by a reduction in the discount rates, and taking into account the recently released U.S. mortality tables. Our pension funding levels remain solid despite the impacts from rates and mortality. The U.S. and worldwide tax-qualified plans were 102% and 97% respectively.
Our balance sheet continues to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the longer term.
So now let me wrap up 2014, and I want to put our revenue and profit performance in the context of the framework we provided at our Investor Day back in May. The strategic imperatives are focused on the market shifts of data, cloud, and engagement. The model for these combined strategic imperatives is to deliver double-digit growth, with high contribution from Software, which obviously drives a more profitable business mix.
In 2014, revenue from our cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security solutions together, was up 16%. And that includes the impact of currency as well as the divested System x business. In total, the strategic imperatives generated $25 billion in revenue, which is about 27% of IBM's total. And our software content is well above the level for overall IBM.
Business analytics revenue for the year was $17 billion, up 7% over last year. Growth was led by our consulting business, as we help our clients extract value from their data. Our cloud revenue in 2014 was up 60% to $7 billion, as we see growing client demands for higher-value cloud solutions across public, private, and hybrid. Revenue from our as-a-Service offerings increased about 75% to $3 billion for the year, and we exited 2014 with an annual run rate for our as-a-Service business of $3.5 billion. The $7 billion also includes revenue from our foundational offerings, where we provide software, hardware and services to clients to build private clouds.
Turning to engagement, our mobile business more than tripled. We had strong growth in MobileFirst driven by an integrated portfolio of offerings, and a great start to our partnership with Apple. Social was up 3% and Security was up 19%. So very good growth in these businesses in line with the double-digit objective. These are also the areas where we are launching initiatives and targeting investment. Earlier I mentioned investments to build out Bluemix, SoftLayer, Watson and the partnerships with Apple, Twitter, SAP and Tencent. These investments and actions support growth into the future.
Now, our Recurring Core Franchises includes our annuity businesses and highly recurring portions of our transactions business, such as mainframe revenue from our largest clients. Most have annuity characteristics, and in many cases, these support mission critical processes for our clients. The model, or signpost, is for these combined businesses to have stable revenue, with improving margin. This year, revenue was down about 3%, with a modest decline in margin. The decline was driven by mainframe cycle and by currency.
We also have high value transactional businesses, which include project-based work in services, transactional software, and Power and Storage, in areas other than our strategic imperatives. The objective here is to optimize our business model, and maintain margins. We've been clear that some parts of our hardware business have had secular challenges. I talked earlier about all of the actions we've taken to reposition our hardware business for high value.
While revenue is down as we work through these transitions, our gross margin remains attractive at over 40%. And of course, we've divested businesses that don't fit our strategic profile, Customer Care, System x, and microelectronics manufacturing. Together these businesses were about $7 billion of revenue in 2013, but lost $500 million of profit. So the divestitures reduce our revenue, but improve our profit profile, clearly in line with our shift to higher value.
Our strategic direction is clear and compelling, and we have made a lot of progress. We have been successful in shifting to the higher value areas of enterprise IT. The strong revenue growth in our strategic imperatives confirms that, as does the overall profitability of our business. We expect the industry to continue to shift, and I want to spend a minute on what we see over the longer term, not in terms of an absolute end point or multi-year objective, but rather in terms of a long term growth trajectory.
We have $25 billion of revenue in our strategic imperatives, and we continue to expect to grow this revenue at a double-digit rate. Keep in mind these areas are as high value as other parts of our business, which continue to manage our clients' most critical business processes. As we get our cloud business to scale, and drive ongoing productivity improvements across our business, we see opportunity to continue to expand margin. And we will continue to allocate capital to investments, and to return value to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.
So over the longer term, when we look at the opportunities we will continue to develop, we see the ability to generate low-single digit revenue growth, and with a higher value mix, high-single digit operating earnings per share growth, with free cash flow realization in the 90's. Of course we will spend more time on the rate and pace of achieving that trajectory at our investor meeting next month.
Now in the near term, there are a few dynamics that are inconsistent with that trajectory. For 2015 specifically, we are dealing with some transitions in our business. For example, while we are fully participating in the shift to cloud, margins are impacted by the level of investment we are making, and the fact that the business is not yet at scale. We will see some year-to-year benefit to margins in 2015 as the business ramps, but we won't yet be at scale. And I talked about the impact to our software transaction revenue growth as customers utilize the flexibility we've provided, as they commit to our platform for the longer term.
And then there are cyclical considerations. Given the geographic breadth of our business, we have seen challenges in some markets, most notably many of the growth markets. We firmly believe these are important markets over time, and we've been investing to capture the opportunity, but we're not counting on a robust demand environment in many geographies in 2015. And then of course, there is the impact from currency. The impact to our revenue growth is obvious as we translate results back to U.S. dollars. But as with all companies with a similar business profile, with the dollar strengthening, currency will have a significant translation impact on our profit growth.
Now, we do have some cyclical benefits, like a tailwind from the new mainframe cycle, and we will have a full year of Power 8. Now when you step back and look at the business, and take into account everything I have just told you about 2015, we will continue to grow in a lot of areas. We will continue to deliver strong growth in our strategic imperatives, we will continue to expand margins, and we will continue a high level of investment and hiring, shifting to areas where we see the best opportunity.
Now in this currency environment, and with the divestitures we've completed, our total revenue as reported will not grow in 2015. I expect less spending in workforce rebalancing, and while we always have gains, we won’t replicate the $1.6 billion of gains we had in 2014, so that will be a net impact to our profit.
When we put it all together for 2014, we expect operating EPS in the range of $15.75 to $16.50. And at that level of profit, we expect free cash flow to be relatively flat. More importantly, we will exit 2015 with a higher value, higher margin business.
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to mention a few items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the year. We also have provided historical data on continuing operations. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.
Operator, can you please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty
Yes. Thank you. As it relates to the EPS guide, how are you expecting PTI in the hardware, software and services businesses to trend relative to the fourth quarter? And then also, should we expect the tax rate to continue to climb higher?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Katy. A few things. So first, on tax, we’ll address that first, because that’s probably the easiest. We’re assuming a tax rate at 20% in the full year, so a slight decline from where we finished 2014.
Now on the guidance in terms of what we saw coming out of the fourth, I think there are a few things that I would mention relative to the trajectories in some of our businesses. We do expect that the launch of the mainframe, along with the success in Power 8 that we’re seeing, that will generate some momentum. And so we would expect to see growth in our systems in kind of the mid-single digit range of growth coming out of '14 when we didn't have the cycle.
In services, we’ve not built a revenue trajectory or assumed revenue trajectory that requires a lot of growth within our EPS. And then the most important I think from a guidance perspective is software. So we have, as you know, a range in our EPS.
And I think the way to characterize the bottom of the guidance and the top of the guidance is that at the bottom of the guidance, we're not assuming that we see an improvement in the trajectory of our software business. And I would characterize the top of the guidance as sort of a stabilization of the software business relative to 2014.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy. Can we please go to the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes. Thank you. I’m wondering if you could elaborate a little bit further on cash flow for 2015. Looks like you're guiding for it to be flat, which is under 80% of net income if I sort of work back or it’s from the midpoint of your range.
Can you help us understand what the forces at work are that create the significant discrepancy between free cash flow and net income? And can you also help us understand how we should be thinking about relative free cash flow spending on acquisitions versus dividend and stock repurchases relative to history?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Toni. A couple of things. So our free cash flow guidance is essentially flat year-to-year, given the range of profit we provided and a couple of things within that. And I’ll try to address this sort of in the reverse order that you asked about it.
Relative to share repurchase, we've only assumed about a 2 to 3 point impact from share repurchase, which is obviously less than what we were able to do in the last year, so a reduced level of share repurchase.
I guess, the way to think about it is we entered 2015 with a bit over 6 billion of authorization remaining and we've just assumed that we used the authorization now. There obviously, timing will impact that's impact on EPS, but think about our share repurchase in the year as consuming the bulk of that authorization.
In terms of dividends, we have assumed that we would obviously, continue to pay the dividend and we’d like to and will talk about the dividend with the Board. We’d like to talk about how we might grow the dividend as well. We typically do that, as you know, in April. So those discussions will start soon.
From a realization perspective, we printed a 79% realization in 2014 and we see that improving to the mid 80's. Now there are a few elements of our free cash flow relative to realization that I think are important to keep in mind. We’ll start it, call it a 100% just for simplicity. We get a 5, 6 point impact just because we have a pension in terms of realization now.
Sometimes that is not as steep as that and sometimes it can be more depending on what the markets due to the pension. But right now in 2014, we saw about a 5-point impact in realization. We also saw in 2014 a substantial impact in realization from our cash taxes, that was about a 10-point impact last year. So pretty substantial impacts in realization. 
We do see that, as I mentioned, improving to the mid 80's in 2015 based on our guidance.
Now there are some unique items within our guidance as well for 2015 that I think it's important to realize. One, we assumed or we are assuming a further increase in our capital acquisitions, our capital expenditures of over $0.5 billion year-to-year, as we continue to build out our cloud platform as we continue to invest in software.
We grew -- excuse me, we grew SoftLayer investment pretty aggressively in 2014. And we’ll continue to do that into 2015. We also have a year-to-year impact in cash flow in our guidance to recognize the timing of the payments for the restructuring actions we've taken. And then finally, as we had in 2014, we also have in 2015.
There is a year-to-year impact from the x series business being out of our results but because of the structure of that there is a working capital impact. So overall guidance that we provided has a profit decline embedded within it and again those -- that combined with the year-to-year impact we see in terms of CapEx restructuring and x series being out, delivers that essentially, flat year-to-year free cash flow.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. Kristine, can we go to the next question please.
Operator
The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
Patricia Murphy
David, you are on mute?
Operator
It looks like he has disconnected. Would you like to move on?
Patricia Murphy
Yes, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steve Milunovich
Thank you. Philosophically, Martin, how did you approach this guidance, even at the low end, you’re only down about 5% in EPS from what you did in ‘14. And given how currencies moved against you and so forth, do you feel you're being conservative enough particularly, given that, it doesn’t sound like the share counts going to come down too aggressively. And maybe you talk about what you're assuming for restructuring since restructuring is part of your reported EPS?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Sure. Steve, so first thing I’d say, the guidance is only about an hour and 15 minutes old. So I’m not going to recharacterize what we’ve already provided. Now having said that and we talked -- I talked a little bit about it in response to Katy’s question, at the low and the high end of the range, I think the primary difference is the software trajectory that you assume. One assumes no change in trajectory at the low-end and one assumes in software stabilization if you will.
And as you said, we’re not going to get the same year-to-year improvement from our share repurchase program that we got last year. But at the same time, we've taken a lot of action to position our business coming out of 2014 that we feel very, very good about.
So that $25 billion of strategic imperatives revenue growing at 16% a year is a very powerful part of the portfolio now. And in fact those deliver gross profit margins that are better than the IBM portal on average I should say because they have a higher software mix in them. So we are not going to get the same level of EPS at a share repurchase I’ve shared. Again the dynamics on software and then the other part that you asked about was restructuring. We are not going to replicate the same level of restructuring that we had last year. It will be a lower mountain.
Now we will continue to remix our skills. It’s part of our business. As you said, we include it in the way we report. So its part of our business, but we will not spend at the same rate. And we will get obviously some of the rollover benefits from what we’ve done this year. So parts of our business continue to do very well, and the elements of the business that don't have that same level of growth remain very high margin, very profitable, very high value for us.
Now I should remind you that currency is a big impact for us. We've included in the backup charts the impact to revenue. It’s about 5 to 6 points based on spot, that's just a revenue impact. As we saw in the fourth quarter, it was nearly a $300 million impact to us in the fourth. And a $300 million on our base that is really the difference between growing pretax income and not growing pretax income in the fourth quarter for us.
So it will be a big impact and despite that, we will grow margins next year or this year as well. So a few, I guess, I’d say puts and takes on this but again I'm not going to re-characterize the guidance, which is now an hour and eighteen minutes old.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Steve. Can we go to our next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
Bill Shope
Okay, thank you. I wanted to see if you could get a bit more detail on the cash flow comments that you made earlier. At the other elements, you mentioned that sustained the gap between cash flow and earnings for this year, which specifically are likely to be less of a factor beyond 2015. And I guess what specifically should allow you to get to that 90% conversion goal overtime?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, a couple of things. So again if I worked down from the 100, we do see an increased allocation of capital to the investments we are making. As I mentioned, we've included in our ‘15 guidance about a more than $0.5 billion of increase.
Now we don't see that rate and pace continuing forever. So yes we see increased capital expenditure requirements overtime as we continue to invest in things like our cloud, but not at the same rate and pace. So that will slow a bit.
At the same time, as we see markets perform or differently, we don't assume that the pension impact, it will not be a year-to-year impact I should say, continuing into the future. So slower CapEx spending growth, reduced impact from the pension on a year-to-year base.
And then, we do see as we go through this transition, as we’ve talked about in our longer-term trajectory, we see profit growth in the high single-digits. And that profit growth has been the primary driver of our free cash flow growth over the year, as we talked a bit about this in Investor Day. The primary driver over the past 10 years of our free cash flow has been profit growth and as we get back to that profit growth, we see most of that converting back into free cash flow as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Bill. Christine, can we please take the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Benjamin Reitzes
Yeah. Thank you. Hey, Martin. You mind talking about acquisitions. Do you feel like you may need to acquire more to recapture a growth trajectory and/or will that be, or will you use the same tuck-in model that you guys have been using previously? I guess my question is do you see a need for bigger bets? And what is the acquisition budget within your guidance for this year? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. A couple of things, Ben. One, the way we approach acquisitions, which has worked very, very well for us is the way to complement the organically developed innovations we can create and then to build around what we view as the future of enterprise IT. So over the last few years with that as sort of an approach, we've been pretty aggressive in acquiring analytics companies. We’ve been pretty aggressive in acquiring -- we bought SoftLayer. We've been building out our cloud platform. We've been aggressive in acquiring new ways for clients to engage with their customers.
So our acquisition model again has been built around our view of the future of enterprise IT and how we supplement the technologies and the innovations we are bringing to market. I think that model works really, really well. Now, I do think that we see two differences, as we move into the future on our acquisition policy or our acquisition approach. One is more of our acquisitions will probably be on an as a service basis as opposed to say an on-premise model. And that’s kind of the nature of the market and that's also where we have a lot of opportunity because we don't really play in some of those areas today.
So, we have over 100 as-a-service offerings, our as-a-service business in total, finished at $3.5 billion on an exit run rate. But we still see a lot of opportunity to expand, if you will in that as a service base. So one is more as-a-service acquisition content and then secondly, we've been more active and been very successful in partnering with leading companies in order to help transform industries and in order to help transform professions. And I think there is a great example in Apple and what we're working on with them and there's a great example in Twitter.
So those partnership models obviously require investment and we investment in them heavily. But we don't have to own all the technology in order to bring it to our clients. And one of the things our clients also went over again is that they look to us to help bring some of these things together so they can they can use it in the most effective enterprise class way. So, you'll see also more partnerships, if you will as opposed to acquisitions. But from an acquisitions standpoint, more as-a-service I would think as opposed to on-prem.

Thanks, Ben. Let’s go the next question, please.

The next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.
Brian White 
Yeah. Hi, Martin. I am wondering if you could talk about how you are thinking of cloud growth in 2015. You talked about 60% growth in 2014. How are you thinking about 2015 in the cloud and net-net, if you could just give us a view on the impact the cloud is having on IBM? Obviously this business is growing, but it’s impacting other parts of the IBM business. Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. So, cloud for us, a $7 billion business. I think that kind of puts us at the forefront of cloud in the cloud industry, in the cloud space if you will, so $7 billion growing 60%. We are delighted with the investments we've made and we see a very powerful opportunity in the cloud. That cloud business for us is made up not only of as-a-service business, which as I mentioned was a $3.5 billion dollar run rate at the end of the year. It also has our foundational offerings in it, where clients are building private clouds and deploying hybrid environments and we've been talking about hybrid for many years now.
We think that the hybrid environment is the way that we see most enterprises getting the benefit of the agility of the cloud linked in with their systems of record. So our foundational offerings are deploying private clouds and hybrid clouds and we see that trend continuing as well. So, $7 billion, we see continued strong double-digit growth in that for us.
Cloud for us remains a terrific opportunity for all aspects of our business. When we sign as an example these large services deals that you’ve seen for instance coming out of Europe, big element of those outsourcing transactions is also to embed and include the cloud environment for those clients as well.
So cloud is sort of permeating a lot of the elements that that we are bringing to market and as part of why we brought all that together into a cloud organization just in January this year, something we mentioned we would do back in October and we announced the cloud unit in January, which will bring all that together for our client. So very powerful opportunity, very substantial business opportunity for us now at $7 billion last year and we see continued strong growth.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Brian. Can we go to the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang. You may ask your question.
Tien-Tsin Huang
Geography and outlook there, it look like Asia plays nicely in the fourth quarter.
Patricia Murphy
Tien-Tsin, can you start again.
Martin Schroeter
Yeah. Can you start again? You cut off in the beginning.
Tien-Tsin Huang
Is this little better?
Martin Schroeter
Yeah. Great. Thank you.
Patricia Murphy
Okay.
Tien-Tsin Huang
Yeah. Just want to ask on geography and the outlook there. I was just saying that Asia look like got a little bit better, Japan and China on the better place. So, any calls out on growth guidance by geography overall for the year? Thanks?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Tien-Tsin. A couple of things, Japan, again had a very good quarter, very consistent growth now and boy we are delighted with the progress that Japan team has made and the way they are bringing innovation to their clients. So I think it's a terrific story for us.
When we look at the other growth markets, the other highlight I’d point out is China, as I said on the prepared remarks, down 1% in the quarter at constant currency, now that’s without the divestiture of the System x business, but we had seen some pretty dramatic declines in that business prior to that.
So with our top banking customers deploying substantial new mainframe capacity in the quarter, we are pleased to see that that business is starting to stabilize. Again X currency, X divestitures, we are pleased to see that business is stabilizing and quite frankly, China has been a substantial business for us and it was again in the fourth and continues to be. We will continue to be a very important part of our business.
And the other geographies in Latin America, I think it's probably worth talking a little bit about because in Latin America, what we had -- in the fourth quarter was an impact from our transactional business as it wrapped on some very strong prior year.
So more annuity like businesses in Brazil and LA, in Brazil in particular, in LA we are fairly stable with good growth and our transactional businesses, which had been growing in the first nine months of the year hit a tough compare and so we are down. So LA finishes the year with growth, very good growth at about 8%, but down in the fourth quarter.
And then in Asia-Pacific, you we did not see a dramatic change in trajectory here going into the fourth in the third and the fourth and even the full year kind of 6% to 7% declines in Asia-Pacific. And fairly consistent even when we look across some of the constituents in the geography, Australia did not get any better, Asian did not get any better. So we are seeing some challenging growth environment in Asia-Pacific.
The one driver, I would say that's going to permute across all these organizations though is that the shift to the cloud, the shift to big data and analytics, and the shift to new systems of engagement is a key source of growth within all these geographies and we see that fairly consistently in our business, that phenomenon is consistent across the geographies.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. You may ask your question.
Joseph Foresi
Hi. I was wondering if we could get a little bit more color around the margin profile for cloud and the timeframe for improving those margins and any targets for the strategic initiatives as a percentage of revenue over the long-term? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. First, I will talk about the margin profile. So what we see across all of our strategic imperatives. We see on that $25 billion base is the gross profit margin that is greater than the IBM average. So we're actually seeing very good margin performance in gross margin on that strategic imperative content and again growing very rapidly.
Now we are investing heavily. So net margins are not -- they don't have that same dynamic. They are not yet greater. But we will see in that as a service business now as we talked a bit about on the call, we will see an improvement in scale, we are not yet at scale, but we will see an improvement in scale as that business from $3.5 billion on a negative run rate continues to grow. So we see good margin opportunity in our strategic imperatives as we deliver high value.
And then in terms of revenue target for strategic imperatives over the long run. I wouldn’t pick a number of percentage per se, what I would say is that, a $25 billion growing solid double-digit just on a trajectory basis, the math would say, you continue to make pretty good progress i.e. continues to represent a bigger and bigger percentage of your revenue. But bear in mind that the recurring core franchise business to us, which is fairly stable and we expect it to continued to be fairly stable, remains very high margin as well as very high value. So those strategic imperatives will continue to grow, very good performance over the long run. They will represent a larger percentage of our business. Obviously, a sheer math would suggest that. But those other Recurring Core Franchises are delivering very high value to clients as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Joe. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
David Grossman
Thank you. Sorry I dropped. So if this has been answered, feel free to take it offline. But I wanted to ask a quick question about software, information management and WebSphere are probably the segments with the most noticeable and perhaps impactful deceleration. And you’ve outlined the issues related to the structuring of the ELAs. Can you provide for us some framework that would help us better understand when you would expect growth to return to more normalized levels and why you would expect that?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, David. And no, it hasn’t been asked yet. So, I’m glad you got back in. Couple things on software. First, we have to remove from a growth trajectory perspective, I'll take the currency impact out and I will talk about it, excluding currency. Full year growth in our software business was -- clearly our software segment was clearly impacted by the operating system content. So that was about a point and a half of impact over the years. So total software group, as you saw at constant currency was down about 1%. That includes just under 1%. That includes the impact of the operating system content. So the difference between the total segment is really the total middleware. Our total middleware business did grow, grew about 1%, excluding the currency.
Now as we’ve said, there is a software-as-a-service business in there that's doing very well, growing 50%. We have elements of our middleware that are doing quite well. And in the prepared remarks, we talked about the flexibility we provided within that growth rate and we saw that in the fourth quarter as well.
The elements of that, the flexibility that we provided to our larger customers, as they deploy, as I mentioned earlier, things like hybrid cloud environments and private cloud environments. Their commitment to the platform over the long-term comes with our giving them some flexibility on how they deploy. So it's an impact of the growth, as I mentioned, total middleware was up a bit in 2014 on a full year basis.
And then within that content, if you look at the more transactional elements of our business, we still signed 350 or so ELAs in the fourth quarter. So the ELA structure still continues to be highly valued by clients. They really are just looking for this flexibility and how they deploy. The other way to look at it or in other way that we think about it, those large clients use flexibility to deploy outside of those large clients.
We actually saw growth in our middleware business, very good growth in our middleware business. So part of way we set the guidance the way we did was really reflective of the question that you asked.
And I guess, the way I’d answer it is for our guidance, we’re not relying on an improvement in trajectory in -- at the low end of guidance. And we are -- we would need a stabilization if you will in order to see the high-end of guidance.
But the phenomenon here is middleware is growing. Total middleware is growing. Different deployment rates in our larger customers than the growth we’re seeing in the rest of our customers.
Patricia Murphy
Okay, Christine, let’s take one last question please.
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.
Amit Daryanani
Thanks a lot. Martin, I guess my question is regarding the transition IBM is undergoing. It looks like 2015 will be another year of EPS decline as we shift revenues towards the strategic imperatives. I’m curious when do you think the business model gets an optimal level where you see the target you outlined of low single-digit sales, high single-digit EPS growth. Is 2016 the year we get there or do you see that happening at a later point?
Martin Schroeter
Well, Amit, we’re going to talk more about the longer term at Investor Day in February. So I'm going to limit my guidance today to talk about 2015 in what we just provided. And I think we characterized it pretty well for what we’re expecting and what is implied if you will in that guidance.
But we look at 2014 and we look at how much we got done in positioning our business for the longer term. Again $25 billion business growing at 16%, including the impacts of currency. We look at the investments we made in our cloud business, including building out our software platform across 15 countries now including things and by the way, we will see the impact of that and the uptake of that capacity going forward.
We look at the relationships we are building and now executing on with again partners like Apple and Twitter and that's not yet in the 2014 obviously because we just did them that has a lot of good growth coming up. We look at the analytics business, the substantial business, $17 billion last year with reasonable growth. And importantly, we’re really pleased with the progress we’re making in commercializing Watson.
I would not characterize the $17 billion as reflective of a substantial revenue impact, if you will, from Watson, certainly a big investment for us but it's absolutely a right investment. And we’ll see all that growth still coming to us. And then we look at other elements of our portfolio like mobile tripling and security up solid double-digit.
So from a growth and investment standpoint, we feel terrific about what we got done in 2014. And then we also undertook a lot of difficult decisions to position our business over the long term for other elements. So we stabilized our STG business in terms of its profitability. We completed the divestiture of our lower value x series business as well as the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing, which is not going to be a payoff in 2015 or 2016. There's a payoff down the road for that but it is the right thing to do for us to remain the leaders in high-performance computing.
So I think 2014 we’ve got a lot done. We feel very good about the progress we made in building out those strategic imperatives to $25 billion business. We feel very good about the overall high-value strategy. We did deliver $21 billion across the corporation of pretax income. And so we feel great about how we’re exiting 2014 and then when we exit 2015, we’ll have again a higher margin business than we did in 2014.
So let me make a few final comments to wrap up the call. So as I just covered kind of it within that, we did get a lot done in 2014. We've got a lot of proof points as I just went through. For 2015, as we indicated we see EPS, operating EPS in the range of $15.75 to $16.50. And within that -- excuse me, within that, we’d see mid single-digit EPS growth in the first quarter.
Now keep in mind, we had large charge last year. So that growth in 1Q is off a low base because it has the charge in it. But again as I finish with Amit, we will exit 2015 with a higher value and the higher margin business. So thank you for joining the call. We look forward to seeing you at Investor Day.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Martin Schroeter.
Martin Schroeter
Thanks Patricia. We've a lot to cover today, our third performance, actions that accelerate the transformation of our business, including important announcements that impact our results and the basis of our reporting, our 2014 guidance and what it means as we move into 2015. Let me start with the top level results.
We reported revenue of $22.4 billion, which is down 4% or 2% at constant currency, excluding our customer care divestiture. We delivered operating net income of $3.7 billion and earnings per share of $3.68, all excluding the discontinued semiconductor manufacturing business. These results fell short of our expectations and I would attribute the shortfall to three primary drivers.
First, our software revenue was weaker than expected. We had some sales execution issues and in addition we've made it easier for our clients to manage their IBM software capacity across new and more traditional workloads as they invest in our platform for the longer term. I'll expand on this later.
Second, we didn't get the productivity required in our services business, impacting both our profit and margin and third, the environment including currency isn’t helping.
With a sharp movement in currency rates in September, there was some effect in the quarter and we expect it to have a larger impact going forward and for the business overall, we did see a slowdown in September, which had a particular impact on us given the skew of our transactional business.
I'll get into the details of the quarter shortly, but let me first describe the actions we are taking and put them into context. For some time now, we've been clear about our strategic direction and how we address the market shifts around data, cloud and engagement. All of this year, we've been launching initiatives and making significant investments to drive this shift.
We've been very successful, with strong revenue growth in our strategic imperatives and you'll see in our third quarter results that the strategic imperatives again delivered double-digit revenue growth, but some of these fundamental shifts in the industry are happening faster than we planned.
So we're putting in place a series of actions to accelerate our transformation. I want to address these right up front. First, we're continuing to remix to higher value. We just took a bold step in our transformation going fabless with the divestiture of our semiconductor manufacturing business.
We have world-class technologist and intellectual property, but this is a capital intensive business, which has been challenging for us without scale. With future node progression and the potential transition to larger wafer sizes, the capital requirements will substantially increase.
Global foundries will acquire our Microelectronics business and will become the semiconductor technology provider for our future systems. This agreement leverages the strength of each company.
IBM semiconductor and material science research, development capabilities and leadership in high end systems and global foundries leadership in advanced technology manufacturing at scale and commitment to delivering future semiconductor technologies enabling them to address new business opportunities.
With global foundries operating at scale, we'll get supply at market based pricing for the long term and we'll exit a business that was not only capital intensive, but also a drag on our profit. Clearly, this is the right move for our business for the long term.
Also in January, we announced the sale of our x86 business to Lenovo and earlier this month, we completed the initial closing. This was a $4 billion business for us in 2013 with effectively no annual profit.
With the transaction, IBM and Lenovo have formed a strategic alliance, which includes an agreement for Lenovo to resell selected IBM storage and software products and to ensure a smooth transition for our clients, IBM will provide x86 related maintenance on Lenovo's behalf.
We'll continue to remix our portfolio by investing in higher value areas and making decisions on businesses that no longer support our high value strategy. Second, we're implementing changes that make it easier to consume our capabilities and innovations and increase our agility.
We're creating vertically integrated units to address key growth areas. As we did with Watson earlier this year, we're creating a dedicated business unit for cloud and other integrated units to address growth areas like security and smarter commerce.
This enables more focused investment and improves our integration and speed in bringing solutions to the market and with our clients.
We're also providing more flexibility to clients in the way they buy our software. Specifically, we're accelerating investments to make our software more directly consumable through digital channels, but we'll have an end-to-end digital sales and marketing channel, which will improve our reach.
Third, we're taking additional actions to simplify our structure and accelerate productivity. For example to improve productivity and services, which at the same time providing greater value and innovation to our clients, we're implementing a number of actions.
These include accelerating the use of automation in our data centers and being more aggressive in our use of global delivery skills and intellectual property across our service lines. Let me tell you what these actions do for our financial model.
In the near term, our revenue will be down, not surprising since the three divestitures this year represent about $7 billion of revenue with pretax losses of about $500 million. So clearly we'll have improved margin profile.
These actions also free up our spend and capital to be reinvested to areas that will accelerate our transformation and these allow us to continue to provide very strong returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
All of this is consistent with our strategic directions and while there are impacts in the short term, we've improved our position for the longer term.
I want to spend a minute on the high level financial implications of the two most recent transactions. We've posted additional information in two articles on our Investor portal.
For the System x business, as I mentioned, this was over a $4 billion business for us last year. Though the business is breakeven on an annual basis, the transactional skew would have driven profit in the fourth quarter.
Starting in the fourth quarter this year, we'll no longer have the System x hardware revenue and profit and the related maintenance will be at a lower revenue and profit level, reflecting the new relationship. At an IBM level, this will result in about a four point impact of revenue growth over the next four quarters, but an improved margin profile.
Our fourth quarter results will include the gain on sale associated with the countries closed net of related transaction and performance based cost. This net gain, as well as the operational profit we lose in the fourth quarter will be included in our view of the full year, which I'll talk about later in the call.
Free cash flow will be impacted by two items, accounts payable for the balances at closing as well as the future procurement IBM will perform on Lenovo's behalf and for cash tax payments made in 2015.
We estimate this will be a use of cash of approximately $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter and another $0.5 billion in 2015.
Turning to the Microelectronics business, the 2013 OEM revenue associated with the divested business was $1.4 billion and our STG segment included pretax losses for this business of over $700 million.
This is being reported as a discontinued operation. In the third quarter disc-ops will include both losses from the ongoing operations of about $90 billion after tax and a one-time after tax charge of $3.3 billion, associated with the transaction.
The transaction had no impact to free cash flow in the third quarter. Now let me spend a minute on the reporting structure.
All of our results obviously start with GAAP, which is in the middle of the chart. To the left is a reference to our prior definition of operating results, which we introduced a few years ago to provide a better perspective on the operational performance of our business. This presentation excluded non-operating retirement related and acquisition related items.
Operating results is the basis of our 2015 roadmap objective and we've provided a view of our results on this basis since 2011. This definition of operating results no longer exists.
Now moving to the right side of the chart, with the reporting of our Microelectronics business as a discontinued operation, all of the financial impacts of that business are lifted out of each line of our P&L and reported in one line, loss on discontinued operations net of tax.
Starting in the third quarter, our GAAP P&L will be on a continuing operations basis. We'll make the same non-operating adjustments to determine our operating results. Then are operating results definition will now be continuing operations basis. This is the basis for our third quarter and year-to-date results, all historical periods presented and our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year.
So now let me get into the third quarter results and again, these are all operating results, which exclude the discontinued operations. We delivered $3.7 billion of operating net income on revenue of $22.4 billion. Revenue was down 4% or 2% at constant currency, excluding the divested customer care business.
On that constant currency basis services was flat, our software segment declined 2% and systems and technology revenue was down double-digit. 90 days ago, we expected that currency would be a modest help to our revenue growth, but in September we saw a sharp move in the currency markets. I'll talk more about currencies later.
Our margins were down with weak hardware performance and insufficient productivity and services. We had a tax headwind of three points year-to-year and we generated $3.7 billion of net income in the quarter. On the bottom line, we reported operating EPS of $3.68, which is down 10%.
Looking at our free cash flow, we generated $2.2 billion, which was relatively flat year-to-year.
Turning to revenue by geography, when you look at the year-to-year performance at constant currency, major markets decelerated two points from last quarter and growth markets one point. These results aren’t normalized for the customer care divestiture. Both major and growth markets are impacted by a point of growth, consistent with last quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, we saw a deceleration in September. This is true in nearly all regions and was most pronounced in our growth markets that have a higher transactional content. Within the growth markets, we again had double-digit growth in Latin America, led by Brazil and good growth in the Middle East and Africa region.
I think it's important to understand the impact of the System x divestiture on the geographic results going forward. Given the geography mix of that business, major markets growth will be impacted by about three points and growth markets by about nine points.
Reporting our divested semiconductor business as a discontinued operation will adjust the OEM revenue, but not impact the geographic results.
Turning to the segment perspective, I'll cover the revenue drivers when we get into the segment discussions. Looking at the gross profit in total, our operating gross margin was down 90 basis points driven by margin declines and systems and technology and in both of our services segments.
The six point decline in systems and technology was due to a combination of lower margin across the brands and a mix away from higher margin z due to the product cycle.
In global technology services, we did get the savings from the workforce rebalancing actions we took earlier in the year and we continue to make investments in capacity and skills, but we didn't get the base productivity we had planned through automation and the transition on some new contracts took longer than expected.
In global business services, we had strong growth with good margin performance in the strategic imperatives, but in the more traditional back office implementations, we continue to see price pressure.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 2% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the 12 months drove two points of expense growth and currency drove one point. The base expense, which is total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency was essentially flat.
Within our base expense, we've been shifting our spending to drive our strategic imperatives and differentiated offerings and with the actions we're taking, we'll accelerate that shift. There are few items that are impacting the year-to-year expense dynamics.
First, we increased our accounts receivable reserves, which impacted expense by over $70 million year-to-year. This coverage is now at 2.2%, which is up from a year ago, but not as high as 2009 levels.
Second, as you would expect; our accrual for 2014 variable compensation is down relative to where we were at the end of the first half. However the reduction in the quarter was not as substantial as last year and so across cost and expense, this element was up $230 million year-to-year.
Finally I want to spend a minute on the impact of currency. The dollar appreciated dramatically in the last several weeks of the quarter and as you know when the dollar appreciates broadly against other currency, it impacts our revenue and earnings.
What is unusual about this is not just the sharp move, but the movements were nearly all in an unfavorable direction for our business profile. We hedge a portion of our cross border cash flows, which as you know differs the impact of the currency movement, but doesn’t eliminate it.
While our hedges are designed to provide stability around the receipt of cash, there no year-to-year benefit in the income statement when a currency's direction is sustained over a longer period.
Looking at the third quarter, we had a modest impact of profit from currency. However at current spot rates, we would expect a significant impact of fourth quarter and into 2015. Now let's turn to the segments and we'll start with services.
This quarter, combined services generated $13.7 billion in revenue, which was flat year-to-year at constant currency adjusted for the customer care divestiture.
Services pretax profit was down 13% year-to-year. Total backlog was $128 million. Adjusting for the divested business and currency, total backlog was down 2% year-to-year.
Global Technology Services revenue was $9.2 billion, down 3% as reported, but up 1% at constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. In the third quarter we ramped on the SoftLayer acquisition and it continues to attract new workloads to the platform.
We're expanding our footprint, and in the third quarter we opened cloud data centers in London and Toronto as well as two federal data centers outside of Dallas and Washington DC. We also added cloud capacity in Singapore.
GTS outsourcing grew 2% at constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. That growth was driven by IT outsourcing performance from the substantial new contracts we brought on in 2013. GTS pretax profit declined 11% in the quarter.
While we continue to benefit from the rebalancing action earlier this year, this was more than offset by the investments across our portfolio in areas like new resiliency centers, additional security skills and the SoftLayer cloud hub expansion.
The loss profit associated with the divested customer care business and we didn't get sufficient productivity in the base. Part of this is due to the large deals we signed last year, which have lower margins in the early stages and we didn't execute those transitions as rapidly as expected.
Global Business services revenue was $4.5 billion down 1% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration declined 1% year-to-year and was flat at constant currency.
We had strong double-digit growth in our practices that are highly differentiated in the marketplace, which address cloud, analytics, mobile and social, offset by declines in the areas that are becoming less differentiated such as the more traditional back office implementations.
During our last call, we discussed our strategic partnership with Apple to deliver a new class of enterprise ready MobileFirst business applications for iOS, combining mobility and analytics. This quarter, we will launch the first dozen applications.
Application outsourcing was down 6% at constant currency, reflecting modest sequential improvement. Our performance continues to be impacted by pricing pressure and client renegotiations as well as a reduction in elective projects.
GBS pre-tax profit was down year-to-year. Hereto we got the benefit from the previous workforce rebalancing actions, but it was more than offset by couple of factors. Lower revenue on a relatively fixed cost base and where we have strong differentiation such as our solutions that address the strategic comparatives we get good growth and margin performance.
But in parts of our portfolio that aren’t as well differentiated, we're continuing to see price and profit pressure. These are the areas where we'll be more aggressive on the use of global delivery centers and applying intellectual property for faster time to value for our clients and improved business results for us.
Software revenue of $5.7 billion was down 2% and middleware was flat. We had solid growth in many of our solution areas like security and mobile and cloud. Across our software brands, Software-as-a-Service offerings were up nearly 50%. But overall software results didn’t meet our expectations.
First, we clearly had some sales execution issues and second given our client's substantial investment in the IBM Software platform we've been providing more flexibility on how they deploy our software with economics that enable their mobile and social work loads on our platforms.
This enables them to better manage their capacity and commit to our platforms for the long term. This will drive higher utilization of our middleware as these mobile and social platforms drive additional on-premise work load.
Looking at our results by brand, WebSphere had another good quarter, up 7%, but by commerce, mobile solutions and business integration offerings. Both on-premise and SaaS offerings contributed to WebSphere growth, with the majority of growth continuing to come from on-premise solutions.
In commerce we saw broad-based growth with strong momentum in commerce as a service, which includes our recent acquisitions such as Silverpop and Aspera.
Across offer and services, IBM’s mobile business more than doubled from the prior year. Information management software was down 5% where we were impacted by our sales execution challenges and some product transitions.
Tivoli revenue was up 3% at constant currency, driven by security and storage software. Security once again grew at a double digit rate. Workflow solutions grew 1% with growth in our social and collaboration solutions mitigated by decline in notes. Rational software was down 12% facing a tough compare.
Across software, we are transitioning our portfolio to capture growth areas. We continue to drive innovation in our core franchises and we will be accelerating investments to make our software more consumable through digital channels.
Systems and Technology revenue of $2.4 billion was down 15%. This reflects the product cycle of System z, and declines in Power, Storage and System x where both power and storage improved sequentially.
We got a lot done recently, including the initial closing on the sale of our industry standard server business to Lenovo, an agreement to divest our semiconductor manufacturing business to Global Foundries and the introduction of our first OpenPOWER based scale out system.
Looking in our results by brand System z revenue was down 35% now in the ninth quarter of the current product cycle. We continue to innovate on this platform and as an example we have recently made available new analytics offerings for the mainframe to provide real time customer insights. With this, IBM adds new analytic capabilities to the mainframe platform, providing clients with the ability to integrate Hadoop big data.
Power revenue declined 12%, which is a significant sequential improvement in year-to-year performance. We have repositioned power. We introduced scale-out systems based on POWER8 in June, and earlier this month we announced high end POWER8 based enterprise systems. These systems are highly scalable and can handle the most data-intensive mission-critical applications in the industry.
In addition, we saw continued expansion of the OpenPOWER consortium now with over 60 members. Through the efforts of consortium members, we have for the first time introduced a system built on IBM’s POWER8 processor that tightly integrates IBM and other OpenPOWER member technologies including end videos, GPU accelerator technology.
Our System x revenue was down 10% and this of course was last quarter before the divestiture. Storage hardware revenue was down 6%, sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter.
We again saw strong contribution from our FLASH systems and our store wise portfolio. This was more than offset by weakness in high-end disk and the continued wind down of our legacy OEM business. We see value in the storage business shifting to software and this quarter, our storage software grew.
We will continue to expand our software defined storage portfolio. So across our systems and technology business, we've taken significant actions to reposition our portfolio and maintain our commitment to driving innovation in our high-end systems and storage.
We committed $3 billion of investment in the next era of chip technology as we strengthen our semiconductor research and development and systems innovation with future chip supply coming from an at scale provider.
We repositioned power through creation of our POWER8 systems, which are built for cloud and big data and also made available the POWER8 architecture through the OpenPOWER consortium to build an open ECO system and an IP Play. We are repositioning storage to capture values through software defined environments and we divested our low end System x business
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter, we generated $3.2 billion of cash from operations, excluding our global financial receivables. We invested a $1 billion in Cap-EX and we generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow, which was down 60 million year-to-year. This includes a $300 million year-to-year increase in cash tax payments.
Through the first three quarter of the year, our net cash from operations excluding financing receivables of $8.6 billion was down $700 million year-to-year. Within that, our cash tax payments were up $1.5 billion year-to-year.
We invested $2.8 billion in capital expenditures, which was up about $100 million from last year. This includes about $350 million investment in software. So this was a good example of where we are shifting spending in the base to new areas. The free cash flow was $5.8 billion down $800 million or up $700 million excluding the impact from cash tax.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.6 billion. Our total assets reflect a reduction of more than $1.5 billion associated with the semiconductor transaction. This concludes a non-cash charge for fixed assets and an increase in deferred tax assets.
Total debt was $45.7 billion, which includes just over $28.5 billion in support of our financing business. We target global financing leverage to be in the range of 7.0 to 7.2 to 1 and we do not have plans to change this model. However, the late quarter impact of foreign exchange on equity was the main driver of the leverage being slightly elevated 7.4 versus our model.
Our non-financing debt was $17.1 billion and our non-financing debt to cap was 62%. While the semiconductor manufacturing divestitures does not affect that levels it does impact equity by approximately $3.3 billion resulting in a seven point impact of the debt to cap ratio. At these levels we continue to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term.
Before we ramp up, I want to spend a minute on the performance of our strategic imperatives that address the areas of data, cloud and the way our clients are engaging.
We have a broad analytics portfolio that helps our clients to extract value from their data. This is a large business for us with revenues last year of $16 billion.
Through September our business analytics revenue was up 8% this year with the strongest growth coming from GBS. Our cloud portfolio support the full scope of enterprise client cloud requirement including solution for private clouds, hybrid clouds and public clouds. Our revenue was up over 50% year to date.
Our as-a-service component was up over 80% and we existed the third quarter with an annual run rate of $3.1 billion. Addressing engagement on year-to-date basis, our mobile revenue more than doubled, our social offerings returned to growth with double-digit growth in the third quarter and our security revenue was up over 20%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and security. Together the revenue in our strategy imperatives was up double-digits and about half of the content was in software.
Now let me bring all of this back together. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we're driving the shift toward our strategic imperatives. Earlier this year, we created a Watson Unit and committed a $1 billion to bring Watson cognitive capabilities to the enterprise.
We launched the BlueMix. We're globally expanding our SoftLayer cloud data centers and we formed a partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility. Now as we exit the third quarter, we're making it easier to do business with us, including creating vertically integrated units to address key growth areas and making our software more consumable through digital channel.
We're taking additional actions to drive more productivity and increase the agility of our company and while we invest the drive for the growth areas, we're also aggressively moving away from the businesses that don’t fit our strategic profile.
The sale of our x86 business and the divestiture of our Microelectronic business are the two most recent examples. Earlier this year, we divested our Customer Care BPO business and as I mentioned, the revenue from these three businesses were $7 million in 2013 and in aggregate, they incurred of pretax loss of more than $500 million, all supporting the shift to higher value.
So let me spend a minute on our view of the full-year. As I said earlier, our operating results are moving to a continuing operations basis. So they exclude the financials associated with the semiconductor business in the current and prior periods.
So when we reflect the discontinued operations in the base, our full-year 2013 operating EPS was $16.64 versus $16.28 based on the prior definition. Within this new operating definition, we've considered a number of items in our guidance for 2014.
First we have completed the initial closing of the sale of our System-X business and as we said, we will no longer have the revenue and profit associated with that business. But in the fourth quarter we will report a gain on the sale, net of related deal and performance based cost.
That net gain will contribute about $0.75 of earnings per share, but that does not reflect a loss profit in the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we execute some of our plans to drive simplification and accelerate productivity in our business, we expect to take a workforce rebalance charge in the fourth quarter.
We are striating to work through our plans, but at this point, we would expect to take a charge of up to $600 million. We've also had a dramatic move in currencies. We've taken into account an impact based on current spot rates. We will see how that plays out.
And of course we've considered the rate and pace of business coming out of the third quarter including the environment. As I noted, we saw slowdown in September in the fourth quarter as our largest transaction quarter.
Put all of this together and we expect full year 2014 operating EPS to be down between 2% and 4% and that's off of last year’s computable base of $16.64.
Given that reduced outlook for earnings, we see a comparable impact of free cash flow for the year. As I mentioned, we can estimate the x86 divestiture impact at about $0.5 billion in the quarter and so with that included, we see free cash flow for the year between $12 and $13 billion at this level of income. Of course this doesn’t include the gain from the divestiture.
Looking forward to 2015, we've always considered a few factors as we look at the progress toward our 2015 objective. The trajectory of the business including the macro environment, the investments we need to be successful over the longer term in enterprise IT and our return of capital to shareholders. Two of these have now changed. The trajectory of the business and the timing of investments we need to make.
Of course it remains a priority to return significant value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Given our third quarter performance, the actions we're taking and with only 15 months till the end of 2015, we longer expect to deliver $20 operating earnings per share in 2015. As is our practice, we will provide our view of 2015 in January.
In the mean time, we have a clear and compelling strategy and we're accelerating our implementation. We will continue to manage our business for the long term and we will absolutely continue to return significant value to our shareholders.
Ginni I look forward to your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I would like to mention a few items. First we have supplemental chart at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information.
As Martin mentioned earlier, we've also posted articles to our Investor website that contain additional information on the two transactions discussed today. Second I would ask you to refrain from multipart questions. And finally I want to remind you that Ginni Rometty has joining today's Q&A.
Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we would like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Sir, please check your mute button.
Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs
Sorry, can you hear me now.
Operator
Yes sir. Go ahead.
Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs
Okay great, thanks. I have a bit of a broader question. Obviously, there is a lot of new inflow here. So I am trying to understand or clarify how we should think about the unifying theme here for the shortfalls you are seeing.
The challenges that really began in 2013 were primarily centered on the growth market. Can you talk about how much of your current challenges are still centered on that issue and how much of it is now is well beyond just a geographic problem at this time.
And I guess related to that, how are you thinking about the potential for stability and growth markets and what that would do for your turnaround potential in 2015? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks Bill. I guess from a unifying theme perspective, the theme that we've been talking about since 2013 is both the secular and cyclical challenges we had in our hardware business and we talked about the profit loss year-to-year last year.
Now relative to the growth markets, that hardware business has slight of assortment outsized effect because it does represent a more of the business there than what we see in the major market.
So that theme within their current results continues despite the actions we've taken within the hardware business to reposition that. We are not yet seeing the benefits -- all of the benefits of that repositioning.
So as we've talked about, we've repositioned power. We have divested of the X series business. We will ramp on the Z series cycle if you will, that's the cyclical element of this.
So the ongoing theme of the hardware business continues and it does have an outsized impact on the growth markets. Now relative to the growth market, specifically the one other point I would make is that there is not a homogeneity around the performance of these growth markets.
What we saw in the growth markets is a continuation of what I would call desperate revenue performance. So Brazil continues to do well. China continues to decline as that hardware business affects them fairly substantially. India declined in the quarter.
What we see in the third quarter was where we have heavy transactional content we tended to have a much bigger decline in that September month. So again the unifying theme around hardware continues and specifically in the growth markets, we're seeing the disparity of performance continue and September impacted those transactional business much more dramatically.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Bill. Can we go to next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Beyond what’s already been announced, what are the paths to accelerated transformation going forward? Are there additional assets sales on the table and also how likely is it that we see more transformative acquisitions going forward?
Martin Schroeter
Well, I guess I would say a couple of things Katy. First, we do invest at a high level every year. Already we spend as you know about $4 billion in capital. We spent $5.5 billion in research and development as examples and we remain acquisitive.
We've had a number of acquisitions this year to solidify if you will the core capabilities we filled around our strategic comparative. So when we think about accelerating the shift, think about it from a SoftLayer prospective for instance.
We said earlier in the year, we put about $1.2 billion into capital into SoftLayer to expand their footprint around the world now. We're not going to add over $1 billion to our overall capital bill. We'll probably wind up adding just a few $100 million year-to-year, but again, we're shifting that into the SoftLayer business and that shift happens over time.
And we think we have a pretty good set of facts around why and how that's working. So you saw again this quarter how the double-digit growth in our strategic imperatives. So as that shift happens over time, we've been able to shift. Now we're going to accelerate that and rebalancing our skill is an element or a means by which we can accelerate that shift.
So yes, we will remain acquisitive. We still believe we have the core capabilities for our view of enterprise IT around data and cloud and engagement build and so we'll continue to add capabilities around those. But our core capabilities are in place. We do invest at a very high level and so we'll just accelerate the means by which we're shifting.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thank you, Katy. Can we please go to the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Yes. Thank you. I have a question for Ginni. Ginni, IBM is missing its free cash flow goal this year by $3 billion to $4 billion, which certainly in investor's eyes is a really significant margin.
The announced actions feel not that different quite frankly from what IBM has been doing for the last 10 years ongoing restructuring, organizational changes and select dispositions in the migration to a higher margin businesses.
So I guess my question for you is do you think this time is different in the sense that do you view the current results as effectively a crisis at IBM and how do to gauge this magnitude of disappointment.
And given that, do you believe that your responses should be outsized and different from what you’ve done historically and do you believe they are because certainly at the surface, they feel somewhat consistent with what you’ve done before.
Ginni Rometty
Okay Tony, look, let's just back up one second and first let me get the context. As you said, does this time feel different? And so as you and we and I've talked with all our investors, this time in this industry is different, all right with these three shifts all going on at once. So it is unprecedented change, which then leads to your question.
There is no doubt look in this quarter and part of the reason I am on the call, obviously we were disappointed in this quarter, but when we talk about what we're doing for the long term and these actions, these actions go on the heels of what has been a series of what I think are very bold actions from the entire year with a very clear strategy, one that's around moving to the enterprise IT to the era of cloud; one that's around data and analytics for transforming our client's industries and professions and then social, mobile and I can't underscore enough security.
So when you step back and look at the full year, when we said these will reorder our industry and therefore we've got to reinvent ourselves like we've done in prior generations, but it will be around these things and just go back to January, Watson, $1 billion investment to start the Group.
As Martin just talked about $1.2 billion to extend our data centers, 25 to 40 for cloud then a $1 for Bluemix. It is a platform, a platform-as-a-service that will provide a platform for innovation for many years to come.
Not to mention the POWER8 having been redone developed bottom up for data and cloud, then $3 billion of research and development for semiconductors that secure our long-term future, not to mention what we did with Apple, with SAP, which are really a fundamental change in partnering strategy that not only apply to Apple and SAP, they really point to us being the go to enterprise that people come to and how to change and how to enter into the enterprise business along with having divested as you just heard as you well know $7 billion of revenue, which by the way was at a loss, $500 million loss right. So empty calories as some of my investors would say.
And then the re-profiling of the STG business. So on the heels of those bold actions, these are three more that can sit, that continue and I consider them quite bold. The idea of cloud altogether integrated verticals and then not to underestimate this point about speed and what we're doing.
In fact, I am going to really sort of punctuate this point on speed, these divestitures do give us some opportunity to go ahead and simplify the business and remove layers. Make no mistake, that's important because the strategies correct and now it's our speed of execution that needs to continue to improve.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you. Can we please go the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Ben Reitzes – Barclays
Yeah, thanks a lot. Quick question I guess for both of you. I wanted to talk about earnings power. I am an old free cash flow guy call me antiquated, but the free cash flow has been averaging let's call it between $12 and $14 last two years.
Your guidance now is about $12.40 if I take the midpoint and you're still reporting EPS and guiding for EPS at $16 plus and we've just had obviously a major setback here and usually when we're dealing with IBM, we've a roadmap and all those things to kind of guide us, but in my training, free cash flow EPS usually migrates towards free cash flow.
So it seems like you have -- the lot of increased investments and what not that are going to keep the free cash flow low for some time, so I guess I wanted your view of earnings power and could we see flat to down EPS for several years now as these two numbers meet in the middle or is the EPS set to have growth from this $16 level despite free cash flow being significantly below. Thanks a lot.
Martin Schroeter
Sure Ben. Thanks for the question. A couple of points. First from a free cash flow standpoint and your data that you just quoted, I won't re-hash it, but with the cash tax headwind this year, which we've talked about in the past, that's obviously an impact and the way the Lenovo transaction is structured has a free cash flow impact not only in the fourth quarter of this year, but that will carry through a little bit to next year as well.
In terms of capital investment requirements and what we need going forward, as I mentioned on Katy's question, we'll grow -- we'll grow capital where we see opportunity and the software example is a good one, but in total, I would expect that our capital requirements to be fairly flat to up a little bit. They won't change dramatically going forward.
And so once we get through some of these -- some of these impacts if you will, some of these headwinds on the cash line, I think we'll have in our relationship that is more like what you're used to from us.
Now there are some other impacts that will affect if you will the ratios as opposed to the free cash flow alone. So as an example, you noted the earnings number on an earnings per share.
Now that has obviously the gain from the Lenovo transaction in it, but that goes into the investing section of free cash flow. It doesn’t go into the free cash flow area. So there are some other impacts or some other dynamics around the free cash flow in the near term that are going to impact those ratios.
The balance sheet itself -- when we look at the balance sheet itself, it looks -- it looks as though it's tracking. When you start and once you make some of these -- once you recognize some of the adjustments that we made, it was the balance sheet itself is continuing to track to the profitability and we would expect that to continue as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Ben. Christine, can we please take the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you. Martin I can appreciate the comments you were making earlier about the hardware business and the impact that it's had on earnings and cash flow; however, you obviously have two very big important businesses beyond that both services and software.
And I guess specifically in software, you had a pretty easy comparison this year and I am wondering if you could just better help us understand exactly what the issues are in software and what you mean by making software more consumable through digital channels and how that's going to impact the business?
Martin Schroeter
Sure David. A couple of things on software, first when we say more consumable through digital channels, when we look at how the world is evolving in terms of how our clients will try, will then buy, a lot of that's moving into a model where they essentially have it through like what we have with our Bluemix or our store if you will, our platform that allows them to try and get access to Bluemix.
So if you haven’t looked at our Bluemix content yet, I would encourage you to get a sense of what we mean by moving to a more digital engagement.
On software specifically on performance, we did see as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see a slowdown in September and that was true in software as well and obviously the software performance has a pretty profound impact on our profit given the margin.
Within software when we looked at our performance, you saw that our WebSphere business continued to grow. It did reasonably well. Our SaaS business, our software-as-a-service business across all of software continue to do well.
Where we had a bit of a struggle was in our IM business, in our Information Management business. Some of that's due to product transitions and some of it as we said in the call is the way we're providing flexibility around our clients as they engage in these enterprise license agreements as they engage to try to manage their capacity requirements.
So again, the software performance impacted certainly in September, but not uniformly we did have pretty good growth in -- as I mentioned in WebSphere and some challenges in IM business, but disappointing as we said, a disappointing quarter for us in software.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thank you, David. Can we please go to the next question?

The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steve Milunovich - UBS
Thank you. Ginni, thanks for joining us today. A question for you. I believe you recently took some of your executives out to the Valley and I know when I go out, I generally come back pretty depressed, they all argue of course they're going to disrupt the large companies that the large companies basically have to break up. There is an inevitability to the difficulties that companies like IBM face.
I was curious what you took away from that if you feel better or worse about IBM's ability to come back and conversely our survey suggests a lot of your customers do want IBM to help them to move forward, but I think investors are concerned that you won't get a lot of these new companies who do start out with a different kind of infrastructure. I wonder if you could comment on that.
Ginni Rometty
Okay. That's a great question Steven. From a couple of different perspectives, first I've out there many times actually. So not even just one and you take a look at our software business and I think this is actually an important point as we've moved not only Watson, but software itself to be a platform for innovation for many companies.
And so what we are finding is that many are very interested in software and software runs some of the most interesting start-up companies that there are. So on one hand, it's about providing them with infrastructure, but then Bluemix and this platform as a service and then the idea that Watson as a platform, which as you know the very different approach we've taken already 3,000 of those partners are in line to get on to Watson, many of those from the West Coast.
So that's one set of messages I pick up that pertain from our what I would call the start-up, but to your other question I think as well an equally interesting to our current client base, I was with 30 CIOs of our biggest clients, just the tail end of last week and to me it was very interesting to hear them talk about what they really need and are going to need even more of our help from.
And if the one -- of all that one of them called being a navigator that there are many of these startups out there and that's interesting for innovation and I agree.
Every company will do some innovation and many of these are cloud companies and the like, but at the end of the day this gets integrated with how their businesses operate today and you can see this now sort of peaking into a point to say, hey look, you are the one that understand how an enterprise operates and how we should pull all this together.
This is a wonderful opportunity for us and it really matches and I believe we've placed the right bet when we said in cloud one of the most important attributes would be hybrid and that's idea of all of us will build businesses part on the cloud. In fact you'll see most of that around things that need to move fast and then you'll have your systems of record.
You'll need to integrate them, that's the world hybrid and we're seeing that play out. That's what people are looking for and that as you know, where we doubled down in creating a lot of capabilities around hybrid in the cloud, about data. We said at the end of the day, it's going to be all about data and it's going to be about security and I believe sure enough all three of those are coming to pass.

The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan
Great. Thanks so much. Just wanted to ask a big picture question on people, labor and culture and things like that. I heard words like workforce, rebalancing, it sounds like you're shifting more to global delivery, more automation right in sales and processes.
So what does this all mean for headcount? Could we see a big change in headcount and more importantly what's the impact on culture? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Thanks Tien-Tsin. It's a good question. So a few things, we have -- we have been reducing headcount just as a function of some of the divestitures that we've been in.
So as an example when we divested our customer care business, our headcounts come down and when we finish the x series divestiture, again same kind of pattern. So our overall headcount is obviously down.
From a culture perspective around the shift to -- around the shift to global delivery centers, quite frankly we've not been as aggressive here as others have been. So we think we have an opportunity -- we have an opportunity move more that work to where we can put it into a more common platform.
So yes, the overall -- yes the overall headcount is coming down and yes, we will be moving more aggressively into the global delivery centers, but again we have not been as aggressive as others and then the other thing I point out is that reduction in overall headcount also allows us now to think about how we simplify our business and some of what you heard in my prepared remarks were around trying to simplify the business.
So yes, the overall headcount is coming down and I think what we would expect is not a dramatic shift if you will in the employee base, but just a reflection of what you’ve seen us publicly announce.
Ginni Rometty
Yes and let me Tien-Tsin, let me go ahead and add, I really want to talk about this point on culture because this is something that we've been working on and I think it's again important as part of any reinvention of any company you have to go and match the culture with it.
And I think of a couple defining characteristics of the culture we are building is. One is speed. The second is the word “engagement” and the third Martin just mentioned around simplification. And so make no bones about it on speed with the whole team and as many of you know, I've been on this and with our teams and it's not enough to tell teams about that you need to go faster.
The point is you point them to where we're going to go. We've been very clear about the strategy and then it's also how you work and many people call that agile or DevOps.
It's this kind of speed that comes with you try things, you fail, you correct them, you keep moving forward and that in fact is what we're building around the company in many of the places where we've done that already; great results and we're going to continue down that path.
So I underscore speed and then the second is this idea about engagement, which really our use of social and mobile within our own company. This of that as a production engine that makes things go faster and it's also by the way what we do with commercial clients, but we've done a great deal of work on this topic to allow the IBMers across the 170 countries to both move to the future and move there with speed, this idea of engagement.
And then as I said Martin mentioned simplify, and partly simplifying is this idea of taking layers out, which is what I just talked about a minute ago. So culture is paramount, take away the word speed and engagement.

The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask your question.
Jim Suva - Citi
Thanks very much and Ginni, appreciate you coming on the call giving the changes in challenges and what's going on. Maybe if you can help us understand a little bit, when we look at the results geographically, it looks like all geographies were down and some may say it's more of an industry situation, but then when we look at IBM's results and compare them to the peers out there and the contenders who may be unique individual companies, they are all seeing a lot better growth.
So then when they say, it's actually IBM focused challenges, can you help us better understand if you view this more as industry or IBM not being nimble enough or how is you kind of view the value trying to paint the culture in IBM to adjust to this new age and these new three focus areas.
Ginni Rometty
So Jim first let me, when I think about revenue in our company, I think first and foremost about moving us to higher value and so when you think of higher value, as we've clearly staked out this idea around data and analytics, around cloud and around social, mobile and security, I want to take you back and just remember that in this quarter and in fact by the way those collectively grew almost 20% and it's improved every quarter, grown every quarter a higher number.
And you take a look at, they're not small businesses. Big data and analytics which ended last year at what we think $16 million and now this quarter, year-to-date 8% and you take a look at cloud, already greater than 50% year-to-date and I think of how we ended last year what we were about $4.4 billion and the as-a-service was about $2.1 billion.
On a run rate, we just now left or exited the $3.1 billion. If these were individual businesses, they would be very highly applauded for their growth rate and then on social, mobile and security, again eight quarters double-digit and so these are in and of themselves large businesses with very high growth rate.
So I view those compared to their peers in those areas. They're doing quite well. Now when I take a look and you say what do I see overall, now we do at core franchises, core franchises that we've said they do mission critical work.
In many cases, we need to keep innovating on them to improve their margin, but they may not be in growth markets and as you know we just as well added to the growth challenge and no apologies for divesting a revenue that is not high value, not core, we need to redeploy that capital to other things.
This announcement this morning of global foundries is a great example of that right. That is a business that requires a fair amount of capital, but require even more going forward. As you look at what's happened as you go from 20 and use a 10, to seven nanometers, let alone a larger wafer size and so that is someone else's business. They're going to do that well. We're going to redeploy that capital into those growth areas.
So when you think of growth, I want you to keep -- and we keep saying the word mix. We're mixing into what we believe are the areas that are aligned with the shifts in the marketplace and then managing for high value.
Well, I guess one last question or one point I would make kind of on macro that might be of interest, I take a look and as Martin said, I can only speak to what happened in our September as what we saw was both broad based across the world, but clearly in the areas where we were high transaction revenue impacted more, but as well I did see when you look by different industries, I see different industries doing different things.
So as an example financial services very focused on things like omnichannel, cyber security as you might expect. In fact I had a dinner with some of the largest CEOs of all the clients in France and there were two topics we talked about; data analytics and security, the entire four hour dinner.
And so this topic and certainly in cyber -- in cyber itself and then married with when you do omnichannel and the impact you have with channel reach, big in financial services, same in retail. So you see some industries pointed more one way. Others pointed more towards efficiency.
So I do see differences around the world, but again back to that September, just based on what we saw and time will tell whether what we saw is pure execution, we're treating it that way or time will tell whether it was something broader.

Thank you. Can we please go to the next question?

The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal
Hi. Thank you. My question relates to services and it's a two part question, can you grow services? Outsourcing is about 45% of revenues, services revenues and outsourcing backlog is down about 8% in constant currency, outsourcing signings and constant currency declined 17%, coupled with that, maintenance is about 13% of services revenue continues to decline.
So when you think about that question, I wanted to add on to, why is IBM underperforming Accenture so dramatically? Is this part of the organizational structure so it really, Ginni you mentioned speed and engagement, it seems like IBM continues to underperform. Would IBM be better off with a different organizational structure perhaps even breaking up the company further allowed for greater speed and organization.
So the two part question is can you grow services and then why is IBM underperforming market leader like Accenture so dramatically? Thank you. 
Martin Schroeter
Sure Keith. A couple of things. So in terms of services, we did not have the signings performance that we were looking for. Now we have some pretty big deals. I wouldn’t say that those deals are gone. Those deals are still out there and the teams continue to work them.
There are -- as always, there are series of complexity in a regulatory environment and things. So we had a large pipeline and when we entered and unfortunately because we didn't get them done or fortunately maybe we have a larger pipeline as we exited the quarter as well.
So we did not get the signings that we wanted. Now as we've talked about in the past, within any given quarter, but if I look at it over a longer term, about 70% of our revenue growth is driven by the backlog that we enter a year with and our backlog now adjusted for -- adjusted for the divestiture of our customer care BPO business is down about 2%.
But what we've been seeing is better yield out of that backlog than what we've seen in the past and so a few dynamics. Backlog down a little bit, but with better performance in terms of what we were getting out of the backlog we've done a bit better.
And then on the in quarter signings what we've in the past talked about in terms of base growth, which the way to think about that is sales into existing customers where we already have contracts there are generally two what I call forms of that.
One form is where we are adding more work, deploying more service on their behalf or something of that sort and we did not see that as much as we expected in this quarter and also there are -- some of our contracts have more volume related metrics tied to their performance and we didn't see the volume levels that we had expected.
Now that could be again macro related. So from a services signings perspective and how it feeds in, I would say that we are not relying on in our guidance a dramatic turnaround. That business however does have some pretty strong underpinnings in it with regard to what we saw in the -- in kind of the base strategic outsourcing business, very good signings growth.
Bear in mind that with the divestiture of our customer care BPO business, that GPS business is going to be down obviously because we're not in that business any more. So across services, not the quarter we wanted in signings but some metrics and some dynamics underneath it that are kind of consistent with what we saw coming out of the third quarter.
On our GBS business, very good performance when we move and where we moved to the new areas including front office digitization and things we've talked about.
So very strong performance in the GBS elements of the business where we see the future and in fact the pipeline now is more than half of that future business and also we'll start to see -- we'll start to see the benefit of -- some of the benefit of our partnership with Apple in the GBS business as well as they start to deploy those mobile apps that we're going to announce this quarter.
So the GBS business -- the GBS business is kind of a mix between very strong performance where we move to the future and continued price pressure and profit pressure in that more traditional packaged applications business. It is very price competitive.
The incumbents are -- the incumbents in an account are protecting those accounts and obviously to break in, we're having to be more aggressive. So it's a pretty aggressive environment.
Ginni Rometty
Yes, I will just add a couple of points here in that, one the comment about versus Accenture right, now remember, managing for high value. So when you look at that from a margins point of view, you would say something different and so a couple of things.
As Martin just described where we grow, I think it's important to see in their business, the team has aligned across where the growth areas are and then aligned in other areas where they need to really just focus on efficiency and productivity.
That will allow them to continue to go faster. So as an example, the team is aligned around strategy and analytics together. We just talked about that result. They’ve aligned around what they call mobile and interactive. In fact we put another $100 million into these mobile studios, interactive design studios around the world.
We are now the largest digital agency as measured by Ad Age, not ourselves, the largest digital agency out there. So their strategy and analytics, big practice, big practice around mobile and interactive.
Both of those have very good growth and then I'll just complement it where Martin said, the other two practices ERP and then the other is application development and maintenance and between those you saw pricing pressure on application packages and you saw it as well as you just described it on application and maintenance area.
But I believe the right way to grow, they’ve actually aligned themselves two different formulas and that is the right focus because remember again it's about managing for higher value.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you. Can we please go to the next question?

The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank
Hi. Thank you. Martin, I was hoping you could give us a little more detail on the FX impact specifically. So it was going to get worse in the fourth quarter and continue into 2015. So just hoping you could give us some detail on the magnitude and how that runs through the P&L? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. So as we've talked about in the past and I mentioned on the -- in my prepared remarks as well. As currencies have a kind of a one directional long-term trend here, our hedging programs to help us manage our cash position really have no benefit to the INE anymore.
So it was the sharp move in the third quarter, was relatively small. It was an impact in the quarter, but relatively small to what we see coming in the fourth and next year.
Now this is all based on the most recent exchange rates and we don't know where this is going to wind up, but in the fourth quarter alone, as an example, FX could be up to the $0.25 in EPS on a year-to-year basis just from the moves to date.
So it has a pretty profound impact on our profitability in the near term and again the hedging programs don't have an INE benefit if you will on a year-over-year basis as the currencies continue to move.
Now next year, we'll talk more about next year when we get together in January, but that magnitude of impact is consistent with what we see in the fourth. Again it's a pretty substantial impact to us and as I noted in the prepared remarks, it wasn’t just, but it was a sharp move, it was that interestingly each of the currency seem to work against us.
Most of the time we see some benefits from some of the crosses, some of the cross FXs, but we just did not see that this quarter.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Sherri. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets
Good morning, guys. So may be just wanted to talk a little bit on the capital -- free cash flow usage as you go forward. We're obviously talking about a bit of a down tic on the free cash flow number, but I am curious how do you view the buyback program as you go forward?
It's only has decelerated in the last few quarters and then when you talk about, excluding your initiatives into the newer IT markets, does that suggest maybe we start to look at more deals or maybe even bigger deals. So maybe if you can start on the buyback and the M&A side of the equation as we go forward?
Martin Schroeter
Sure Amit, sure. So maybe I'll address the acquisition side of this first. We do continue to see ourselves being active. Now our acquisition model, which we think is a powerful one that works quite well for us is really built around a couple of basic principles.
One is that we're not looking to acquire to change if you will who IBM is right. We have a very good position in enterprise IT and our acquisition strategy is to supplement our view of where we see enterprise IT moving around data, cloud and engagement.
Two, we need to in order to drive the economics out of these acquisitions; we need to find things that we can put into our distribution channel immediately and get the -- and start to get the returns immediately and what that tends to me for us then is that acquisitions tend to be smaller because they have not yet fully globalized and we want to take advantage of that by bringing those products out to our clients.
And then three, the basics here and my boss sitting next to me is going to remind me as well, we don’t do what I would call strategic and I’ll do the air quote, strategic acquisition they have to make sense economically and we will continue to make sure that our acquisition content is on a sound economic basis.
In terms of share repurchase, we have been quite aggressive and the share repurchase and the resulting reduction in shares is -- it's fairly linear. It's something we've been doing for a long time. We've been returning capital to shareholders.
The result or the impact is as mentioned fairly linear, so if we were to reduce -- if we were to reduce our share repurchase going forward, it would have a commensurate reduction in how many shares we take obviously.
That’s not going to surprise you, but remember we've been -- since we've been aggressive, we can still have -- going forward, we can still have a very meaningful share reduction even if we were to reduce our levels going forward.
And we feel very comfortable with the capacity and the flexibility we still have to continue to return capital to shareholders both through share repurchase as well as through dividend.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. We've run a little late here. So Christine, why don’t we take one last question.
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your ask your question.
Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald
Good morning, I just wanted to be clear what did the chip business lose in 2013 and what are the expectations for loss in 2014? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter - SVP and CFO

I think. Hi Brian, I think we have provided this detail in the portal article, but just to go through the data, 2013 we had a loss of $700 million on a pretax basis and '14 is basically flat to what we saw in 2013.
Ginni Rometty
Slightly better than that.
Martin Schroeter - SVP and CFO

Little bit better. So 2013, $700 million loss, 2014 a little bit better and again the details are in the portal.
Ginni Rometty
Okay. So let me -- I think it's probably good time for me then to wrap up here and I would like to make a couple of comments.
And first I would like to just really summarize for everyone why I thought it was important to join the call today. As many of you referenced in your comments, we had two strategically important announcements that we made.
One was this divestiture of the Microelectronic business. It's an important strategic move and very important to us. Martin just commented about some of the financial around it, but it is more than that. It is about strategy.
The second is and the second important reason I wanted to join is, we no longer expect to deliver that 2015 EPS objective, which we have talked about and as you know it has been in place for some time.
But these two things do come together and are underpinned by what I believe is a singularly importantly message to our investors and that we are reinventing and we are managing this company for the long term.
So while make no mistake, our results this quarter were disappointing and we don’t want to minimize that. We have though been very clear that this industry is shifting and we have been executing our strategy that moves this company to the future.
Now I am absolutely convinced that we are over the right target. We see the evidence of it. You see it in the results and analytics, in cloud, in mobile, social and security and we have taken, as I was going through very big steps and bold moves to move this company to higher value and that does include -- it does include divesting businesses that really don’t fit our strategic profile including today's divestiture of Microelectronics.
In fact, I’ve asked you just to keep remembering that the divestitures this year alone represent $7 billion of annual revenue, but revenue that is absolutely with considerable loss this time.
So our company it is fundamentally better positioned than it was a few years ago, but as I said, we have more to do and we need to do it faster.
Now while many things are changing, as I always say to our team, they're changing because they must. There are some things though that will not change and they have not changed and I wanted to end our call on those couple points.
We're going to continue to shift this company and this business to a higher value. We're going to continue to manage this business for the long term and we will continue to deliver significant value to shareholders. In the end I believe these are the principals that are the hallmark of the IBM Company.
So on behalf of Martin and I, let me thank you for joining us today.

Martin Schroeter
Thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter and first half results reflect the stability of our overall business model, as we transform the company.
Looking at the dynamics of our portfolio, we're continuing to drive double-digit growth in the parts of our business that address the emerging trends in enterprise IT. We had stability in our core franchises, where we continue to drive innovation. We're dealing with secular shifts in parts of our hardware business and as we shift to higher value, we have the impact of a divested business.
Overall, our year-to-year revenue performance improved from last quarter at actual rates and was fairly consistent at constant currency. We expanded margins and we grew earnings per share. The profit dynamics also reflect the actions we've taken to transform our business. I'll get into that shortly.
In the first quarter, you'll remember that we announced a number of initiatives that support the shift to our strategic areas of data, cloud and systems of engagement. These included the launch of Bluemix, which is our cloud platform-as-a service for the enterprise. It included a $1.2 billion investment to globally expand SoftLayer cloud hubs, and it included a $1 billion investment to bring Watson's cognitive capabilities to the enterprise.
In the second quarter, we made progress to implement these initiatives, including in June, Bluemix became generally available. We opened new SoftLayer data centers. We started to ship POWER8, and expanded the OpenPOWER consortium. And we completed substantially all of the divestiture of our customer care business.
More recently, we announced additional actions to continue our shift to higher value. You saw last week that we're investing $3 billion over the next five years in research and in early-stage development to create the next generation of chip technologies. Those will fuel the systems required for cloud, big data and cognitive systems. And just a couple of days ago, IBM and Apple announced a strategic global partnership to provide a new level of business value from mobility for enterprise clients.
The underlying theme of all of this, from the expansion of our cloud platforms and capacity to the OpenPOWER consortium, to the partnership with Apple for enterprise mobility to next generation chip technologies, is that we're leveraging our unique strengths and innovation, and enterprise capabilities to maintain our differentiation in the emerging areas of enterprise IT. While some of these actions impact our results in the short-term, they better position our business for the long-term.
For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $24.4 billion and operating earnings per share of $4.32. Our revenue was down 2% or down 1% at constant currency, adjusting for the customer care divestiture. We improved gross margin by 10 basis points, the 22nd consecutive quarter of operating gross margin expansion.
Our pre-tax and net margins are up significantly. Last year's profit base was lower, due to a workforce rebalancing charge of about $1 billion. We took a charge of a similar size in the first quarter of 2014, and so on a six-month basis the charges are fairly neutral to profit growth.
On the bottomline, we reported operating earnings per share of $4.32 in the second quarter, which is up 34% and we generated $3 billion of free cash flow, which is up $300 million over last year.
Let me spend a minute on the first half performance. The revenue performance for the half is very similar to the second quarter. Through six months, we had double-digit revenue growth in strategic initiatives, stable performance in our core franchises and the impact of some secular trends in parts of hardware and from the divested business.
Looking at profit. We expanded gross margin 50 basis points, pre-tax margin by 70 basis points and net margin by 50 basis points. All while shifting investment to key areas. Operating earnings per share for the first half were up 9.5%. We generated free cash flow of $3.6 billion, which is down $800 million, though up $400 million without the higher level of cash taxes we paid in the first half.
So now I'll get into the details of the quarter, starting with revenue by geography on a constant currency basis. Americas' revenue was up 1% year-to-year, a 3 point sequential improvement from the first quarter rate. From a regional perspective, the U.S. rate also improved 3 points, and we had another great quarter in our Latin America region. The improvement in the Americas was driven by the strong System z mainframe performance.
EMEA declined this quarter. Within Western Europe, we had continued growth in Germany and Italy, though the U.K. and France were down. Eastern Europe also declined. Our performance in Asia-Pacific was pretty consistent with last quarter. We had another good quarter in Japan, our seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth in the country. Asia-Pacific, outside of Japan, declined at a double-digit rate.
In total, major markets were down 1%, while growth markets were down 4%. Within the growth markets, the BRICs were up 1%, which is a 7 point sequential improvement from the first quarter rate. The improvement was driven by Brazil, India and China, each up between 9 points and 10 points sequentially.
Brazil grew over 20% year-to-year, driven by large deals in the financial sector and India returned to growth. Our revenue in China was down 11%, effectively halving the rate of decline from the last couple of quarters. So this is a change in trajectory in China, but we haven't yet seen improvement in the other Asia-Pacific countries. Put it all together, and we had modest sequential improvement in our growth markets performance.
Turning to the segment perspective. Our Services revenue was up 1%, adjusting for the sale of the customer care business. Global Technology Services performance at constant currency was similar to last quarter, with growth in cloud and a ramp in the large outsourcing contracts we signed last year. Global Business Services once again had very strong growth in the practices that address the digital front office, however performance in the globally integrated enterprise offerings lagged.
In Software, middleware is up 3%, while operating systems were down, resulting in modest reported growth for total software. We're continuing to drive strong results in strategic areas like mobile and security, as well as in some of our core franchises like our app servers and distributed databases. While still down, our hardware year-to-year revenue performance improved significantly from the first quarter rate, driven by our System z mainframe, System x and Storage.
Looking at the gross profit, in total, our operating gross margin improved modestly. The increase was driven by margin improvement in Global Technology Services and an improving mix. This was mitigated by margin declines in Global Business Services and in Systems and Technology.
When you look at gross profit dollars, the year-to-year decline was driven entirely by our Systems and Technology business. Aside from STG, our gross profit is flat, even after a $70 million impact from the divested customer care business, and while we transition to some of the emerging areas, where the profit and margins will benefit from scale.
Our total operating expense and other income was better by 14% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. For the last three years, acquisitions have contributed between 1 point and 3 points of expense growth each quarter. Currency drove 1 point of expense growth; so base expense, which is total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency, was down 17 points.
There is one large item that is impacting the year-to-year expense dynamics. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we had $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter of last year. This impacted the base performance by 12 points. So without the impact of that item, our base expense would have been better 5 points year-to-year. This is a better indication of the productivity in the base.
The other item I'll mention is the gain of over $100 million from the sale of our customer care business, associated with the country closings we completed in the second quarter. This is in other income and expense. Keep in mind, the divested business removed about $70 million of gross profit.
Within our base expense, we're also continuing to shift our spending to drive our strategic imperatives and differentiated offerings. The substantial investments we're making in cloud, which includes Bluemix, in Watson and in chip innovation are examples of this.
Now let's turn to the segments, and we'll start with Services. This quarter, the Services businesses generated $14 billion in revenue, which was down 1% at constant currency. This is where we see the impact of the customer care divestiture in the year-to-year results. So adjusting for that divestiture, total services revenue was up 1% year-to-year.
Services pre-tax profit was up 26% and margin improved over 4 points. I'll discuss the profit drivers within the brand details. Total backlog was $136 billion. We reduced backlog by nearly $4 billion, when we divested the customer care business in January. Adjusted for the divested business, total backlog was down 1% at spot rates.
Global Technology Services revenue was $9.4 billion, down 1% as reported, but up 2% at constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. SoftLayer contributed about 1 point to GTS revenue growth in the quarter. We're expanding our footprint, and in the second quarter, we opened a cloud data center in Hong Kong, and followed that with London, earlier this week. We'll continue to roll out additional capacity in the third and fourth quarters.
GTS outsourcing, one of our core franchises, continue to improve, with revenue growth of 2% at constant currency, adjusted for the divestiture. Revenue growth was driven by the substantial new contracts we brought on in 2013 and we expanded gross margin.
GTS pre-tax profit was up significantly in the quarter. The profit performance was driven by several key factors: first, we're continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as mobility, security, and cloud. These investments result in a differentiated set of capabilities that complement our clients' systems of record, and are a good example of how we continue to evolve our core franchises.
Second, profit reflects the gain from the completion of several country closings in the customer care divestiture, partially offset by the profit lost from the divested business. Finally, we have the benefit from the past rebalancing actions. The year-to-year growth also reflects the absence of workforce rebalancing charges compared to last year.
Turning to Global Business services, revenue of $4.5 billion was down 2%. Consulting and Systems Integration grew 1% and flat at constant currency. We had strong double-digit growth in our practices that address the digital front office, particularly in cloud, analytics and mobile.
This was offset by declines in our traditional packaged application implementations. As our Digital Front Office offerings become a larger part of the portfolio, they will contribute more meaningfully to topline performance.
Two days ago, we announced a strategic partnership with Apple to deliver a new class of enterprise ready, MobileFirst business applications for iOS. With this partnership, IBM's consultants and other client-facing specialists will help expand mobile device productivity, enabling big data and analytics at the point of contact.
Application outsourcing was down 9%, in line with last quarter's results. Our performance continues to reflect pricing pressure and client contract renegotiations as well as a reduction in elective projects. GBS pre-tax profit grew 34% year-to-year, and reflects both year-to-year benefit in workforce rebalancing charges and the impact of lower revenue on a relatively fixed cost base.
Software revenue of $6.5 billion was up 1% and flat at constant currency. Middleware grew 3%, and within that the branded middleware was flat at constant currency on a tough compare from last year.
We had good growth in several of our strategic areas, cloud, big data and analytics, mobile and security. Across our software brands, Software-as-a-Service offerings are growing very quickly. This quarter our SaaS offerings grew by nearly 40%.
Looking at our results by brand. WebSphere had another good quarter, up 5% at constant currency, led by app server, commerce and mobile solutions. Both on-premise and SaaS offerings contributed to WebSphere growth, with the majority of WebSphere growth coming from on-premise solutions.
Our Application Server business delivered strong growth, with an increase in demand for on-premise software that was driven by mobile and analytics workloads. We continue to have strong growth in MobileFirst, leveraging over 5,000 mobile experts and our expanding capabilities. Supporting our partnership with Apple, our software group will develop unique enterprise cloud services, native for iOS, to deliver the full enterprise-class mobile experience from analytics to cloud storage and data security.
Information Management software was down 2% at constant currency. Once again, relational database grew, though some product areas in the brand faced tough compares.
Tivoli revenue was up 3% at constant currency, driven by security software. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of growth in security software, with most of those quarters up double-digits. That's also every quarter since we acquired Q1Labs and built our security division around that acquisition, supplemented by additional analytics capabilities. Workforce Solutions declined 8% at constant currency, as we transition from on-premise Notes, to our SaaS offerings.
Across software, we are transitioning our portfolio to capture growth areas, and we continue to drive innovation in our core franchises. We're growing and building capabilities in emerging areas like Software-as-a-Service, mobile and security and also in more traditional areas such as application server and relational database, as new growth areas drive the need for on-premise capabilities. This quarter we faced a difficult compare, we expect our revenue growth to accelerate in the second half.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.3 billion was down 11%. This is a significant improvement in the year-to-year performance compared to last quarter. The improvement was driven by System z as well as sequential improvements in System x and Storage. This, together with actions to align our structure to the demand profile, resulted in progress in stabilizing our profit.
Looking at our results by brand, System z revenue was down 1% on flat MIPS, which is significant performance in the seventh quarter following the product announcement. In the quarter, we had large deals in the financial sector in China, the United States and Brazil. When you compare this cycle to date versus the prior cycle, we have shipped 25% more MIPS, and the STG revenue and gross profit are each about 98% of the previous cycle, net of currency.
The System z platform is one of our core franchises benefitting from IT trends. The value proposition for z becomes stronger as the scale of data and transactions grow as well as the need for security of that data and those transactions.
Power revenue declined 28%. The year-to-year performance reflects fundamental changes in the business, and as we have talked about in past calls, we have taken actions to align our structure to the demand profile, while investing to address where we see opportunity in the future.
First, we launched entry-level or scale-out POWER8 in June, and had a good start compared to previous cycles. Keep in mind that entry-level is a small portion of the Power business. POWER8 will be introduced into the mid-range and high-end segments over the remainder of the year.
And second, we expanded our OpenPOWER consortium, doubling the number of alliance members in the second quarter. At the end of June, we had 36 members across 10 countries, including nine in China, so globally diverse. The membership is across the stack, from chip designers to hardware component OEMs, to system vendors to middleware and software providers.
With this alliance, members have access to high-end technology, as the Power architecture is available for open development and to integrate new designs into their hardware platforms. For example, alliance members can design and control their own encryption.
Our System x revenue was down 3%, which is an improvement from last quarter, when revenue was down 18%. As you know, we're in the process of divesting this business to Lenovo, and are awaiting regulatory approvals. Storage hardware revenue was down 12%, a sequential improvement from the rate in the prior quarter.
We saw strong growth in our Flash Systems, as we doubled our revenue over last year and in our Storwize portfolio, which was up double digits. However, this was more than offset by weakness in high-end disk and the continued wind-down of our OEM business. We had a number of launches this quarter, including the V7000 update to our Storwize portfolio and Flash-enabled DS8K.
As we've discussed over the last couple of earnings calls, our focus for STG in 2014 is to stabilize the profit base, and after the first half we are on track. Within that envelope, we will continue to make investments in this business to remain a leader in high-performance, high-end systems.
Our announcement last week to invest $3 billion over the next five years to tackle the challenges of the post-silicon era, demonstrates our commitment to innovation, and to leading in the new era of enterprise IT.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $3 billion of free cash flow, which was up $300 million year-to-year. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $3.6 billion was down $800 million year-to-year. This performance was impacted by the significant increase in cash taxes in 2014, which I talked about earlier this year. Without the impact of cash tax payments, our free cash flow was up $400 million year-to-year.
Looking at the uses of our cash in the first half, we spent $600 million on acquisitions, including Silverpop and Cognea in the second quarter. We returned $13.9 billion to shareholders. Of that, $11.8 billion was in gross share repurchases and at the end of June we had $3.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. In June we reached a milestone, we finished the month with fewer than 1 billion shares outstanding.
Let me put this in perspective. We started our share repurchase program in 1995, when we had more than 2 billion shares outstanding. So we've reduced our share count by more than 50% and the average price we've paid from the start in 1995 through June 30 of this year is less than $100 per share.
We took our dividend up 16% in April, and through June we paid out $2.1 billion this year. This is the 19th consecutive year that we raised our dividend and the 11th year in a row of double-digit increases. With our cash flow performance in the first half, we are on track to generate $16 billion of free cash flow for the year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.7 billion. Total debt was $46.5 billion, which includes over $29 billion to support our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $17.1 billion and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 56%.
As I mentioned last quarter, given the skew of free cash flow, we expect our debt-to-cap to be in the 50s through the third quarter, and roughly flat year-to-year at the end of the year. We continue to have the financial flexibility to support our business over the long term, as we transition to the new areas of enterprise IT.
So now let me wrap up the discussion of the first half results, and put it in the context of what we discussed at our Investor Day in May. We have set of offerings that address the strategic areas of data, cloud and the way our clients are engaging. We said that the model was to deliver double-digit revenue growth for these areas, with high software content.
Our first half results were consistent with that part of the model. Our business analytics revenue was up 7% on a large base and cloud revenue was up over 50%, with our as-a-service business doubling once again. Our security revenue was up over 20% and we more than doubled our revenue in mobile. Together, the revenue in our strategic imperatives was up double-digits and about half of the content was in software.
At the same time in May, we discussed our core franchises, where we continue to innovate. These include our longer-term services business, our recurring software business and mainframe business with our large capacity clients. The model is a stable revenue base and we are on track here too.
Finally, we have transactional businesses that are shifting to higher value. We're continuing to evolve the portfolio, investing in capabilities in some areas, while divesting businesses that don't support our shift to high value.
In the first half, we completed the sale of our customer care business and announced the sale of our industry-standard server business to Lenovo. These impact our topline performance, but are clearly the right moves for us for the long term.
We continue to drive these shifts. Let me summarize what we've gotten done in the first half of this year. We took Bluemix live, we're adding new SoftLayer cloud hubs and we're ramping our investment to commercialize Watson.
We've introduced POWER8 for big data and cloud at the entry-level and are expanding our OpenPOWER consortium. And we've committed $3 billion to drive chip innovation, while launching an important new partnership with Apple to extend IBM's position in the enterprise mobile space.
When you pull all of this together, for the half, revenue was relatively flat at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture, pre-tax margin expanded by 70 basis points and net margin by 50 basis points and operating earnings per share were up 9.5%.
As we look to the full year of 2014, we expect to deliver at least $18 of operating earnings per share. And we still expect to deliver at least $20 of operating earnings per share in 2015. These are points along the way to delivering performance and shareholder value over the long term.
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information. And second, as always I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Christine, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs
Can you comment on how you're currently thinking about the potential for stabilization and perhaps even growth in the Asia-Pac, x Japan region, obviously, you saw some improvement in China? But in terms of the overall region, how should we think about the revenue and profit trajectory from here? And then I guess related to that, on the profit side, can you walk us through some of the permanent changes you're making to your cost structure in that region specifically?
Martin Schroeter
I guess, I'd say a couple of things. As you noted, we did see a pretty good sequential improvement in China and in India as well in the second quarter, but as we noted in the prepared remarks, we did not see that sequential improvement in AP. And notably within that, I would say, we saw degradation in both Australia and Korea within that AP geography.
Now, when we look forward, in China, we still see a continued improvement in the sequential performance out of China now. It's important to note in China, even though we were still down year-to-year sequentially, not only do we see a year-over-year improvement, but our business in China was about an $800 million business in the first quarter and in the second quarter it was over $1 billion. So we see a very typical sequential skew in China, which is growth in the second.
So again, as we see that year-to-year sequential improvement in China that we expect, this is still a substantial business for us. Now, we did not see and we do not see yet a material change in the trajectory in the rest of Asia-Pacific. As I noted, Australia and Korea were slow in the second, and we don't see that.
Outside that area -- I'll comment also on some of the other growth markets. Latin America as an example, as you heard in our prepared remarks, had another strong quarter, again led by Brazil, which was up double-digit. And although they are going to ramp on a strong second half from last year, we still see good performance coming out of Latin America.
From an investment perspective, we have made substantial commitments to those growth markets and we see good opportunity to deploy the IBM platform. And we continue to invest in those growth markets to get that IBM platform deployed across the growth markets.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Bill. Let's go to the next question please.
Operator
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
I appreciate all the investments in the pace of change that IBM is undertaking and accomplished so far in the first half. I guess, the question that I hear a lot from investors is, is that change big enough to offset what appears to be deterioration or secular pressures in the core franchise? So very specifically, coming out of last quarter, you did not have a good Software quarter, you were optimistic that Software would be notably better this quarter, it was worse. It was flat at constant currency.
Similarly, when I look at Services, which is really the other big core part of your franchise, Services signings are now down 33% for the first half. The signings this quarter were the lowest in more than six years in absolute term. And you've got nine straight quarters with negative revenue growth in Services.
So very specifically, can you address what was the shortfall in Software this quarter relative to much more positive expectations you had coming in? And secondly, when you look at Services, given the preponderance of data, I just offered to you, and given the leading indicator of signings being so weak, what secularly is going on there and how does the business get better from here?
Martin Schroeter
Thanks, Toni. There is a lot there. So let me try to talk a bit about Software first and talk a bit about Services next. So first on Software, my view 90 days ago was that Software would accelerate through the remainder of the year. And I still feel like in second half, we will see Software acceleration back to mid-single digit growth.
Now, in the second quarter, we saw a couple of things: one, the headwind that we have in that total Software segment from the operating system, content was 3 points and that's kind of the high point, if you will, of the headwind that we expect from that operating system content. So that headwind diminishes a bit; and then secondly, we continue to see a very good Software performance coming from our kind of typical Enterprise License Agreements, as we go through the second half, again to drive that mid-single digit revenue.
On Services. Services, we said 90 days ago that we would see revenue performance kind of consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, and we still feel that way. Services was, when you adjust for the divestiture, Services was up 1 point and we continue to see that.
Now, as you noted, we had a weak signings quarter in the second. Now, that was on the back of first quarter last year of signings growth, first and second quarter of last year north of 30%. So we had a difficult compare. We knew that in the first half. But we do see getting the signings content growing again in the third.
And so when we look at the revenue streams for Services. Again, we expect them to be consistent with what we have seen to date. I think we feel, as though that the yield were getting out of the in-period revenue is a bit better than what you would normally do if you just ran it mathematically, we're getting the better yield.
Two, we have outside of the backlog, you see, we have content, the transactional content like our cloud business, which continues to grow. And then third, we will, as I mentioned, get additional third quarter signings growth that will deliver the rest of that pretty modest 1% growth on an adjusted basis, without the divestitures going forward.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. Let's go to the next question please.
Operator
The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley
As a follow-up to last question on the weak Software and signings numbers, did you in fact see deal push-outs in the quarter? And if so what do you think caused that and have you been able to close the business in the third quarter?
Martin Schroeter
There are deals that come in -- I don't know, I would not characterize it as a deal push-out. There are a few phenomena though, that I think are worth noting. In our key branded middleware business, it's a mix of both, transactional content as well as subscription and support, which comes in over time. So it's a mix of transactional content and subscription support, but very heavily transaction content.
In our total middleware business, so in the other middleware that comprises that total middleware business, we have a mix, as well, some transactional content and some subscription content, but the mix is kind of flipped in that case. So there is a lot more subscription content. What we see in any given quarter, you can see this kind of a mix shift, we saw a much higher transactional content in that total middleware line. And then the key branded middleware quarter-to-quarter behave very similarly as what we saw in the first quarter.
So last year in key branded middleware, first to second quarter, we grew that content just under $800 million quarter-to-quarter. And that delivered 10% growth by the way. This year we grew that same key branded middleware a bit over $800 million. So a bit more than last year, but because of the strong compare that drove kind of a flat year-to-year performance. So we have a phenomena of different mixes between transactional and subscription support, and we have quite frankly a tough compare in key branded middleware.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Katy. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus.
David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus
Martin, I think you had mentioned that free cash flow is down $800 million year-over-year for the first six months, and I think the math suggest that $1.2 billion of that $2 billion cash tax headwind is reflected in that figure. So assuming the $18 in earnings is a good number, how much visibility do you have on the change in working capital at this point in the year? And your ability to hit that $16 billion free cash flow target for the year?
Martin Schroeter
I would say, there are couple of phenomena that are going to drive that free cash flow. So first is, as you pointed out, when we make earnings -- I guess I'd say it this way, when we make earnings, we'll make the free cash flow number. And I think that that phenomena that drives that obviously there is profitability skew in the second half here that drives on an absolute basis that drives that.
And secondly, within the sales cycle working capital component, the other phenomena is our Enterprise License Agreement cycle we're in, that software content drives a substantial amount of free cash flow as well. So between, again, the profit and the mix towards the second half as well as the phenomena of the cash structure, if you will, of our ELA cycle, I think we have a very strong statement to say, when we make profit, we'll make cash flow.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks David. Can we go to the next question please?

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays
I want to ask about hardware, and just sorry a two-parter, but mainframe down only 1% was much big improvement, very big improvement from last quarter. So what happened there and is that sustainable? And then, there are some reports out there, and I know you're aware of them about your -- what you might do with your chip making capabilities? And you announced a very large investment commitment to your chip making R&D during the quarter or during this month. So can you just reconcile that, I think you understand what we're hearing out there and what is the commitment to the chip making business as well?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Ben. So couple of things, first, on mainframe, we did have a very strong mainframe quarter, as you noted just down 1% and in the seventh quarter of the cycle down 1% is quite good. Now in the first half, we were kind of down in the mid-teens, right, in the first quarter we were down pretty healthy double-digit, down 1% in this quarter gets us to a down mid-teens, and that's very typical, that performance, that mid-teens is very typical of where we would expect the next couple of quarters to be again given the cycle.
Now, I think the reason that the mainframe continues to do so well and we had in the prepared remarks that in this cycle the revenue and GP is roughly 98% of where it was in the prior cycle. This continues to be now a core franchise for us. But it is the critical infrastructure that drives still 70% of the world's enterprise data.
And as our clients are moving towards new systems of engagement and mobility and they want the most secure platform, the mainframe remains the premier platform on which to drive a world-class enterprise structure. So I don't expect that we're going to see a minus 1% going forward. But I think that first half performance is consistent with what we would expect.
And then, on the semiconductors, as you said, we did announce a $3 billion investment in semiconductor research and development. And as we've said a number of times it was in our Chairman's letter to shareholders, we've been very, very vocal about our goal to remain the leader, the absolutely leader in high performance and high-end systems. We're the leader today and we would expect with this kind of investment we can continue to maintain that leadership.
Now, this R&D investment is clearly focused on the distant future where we have, we have to figure out how to scale semiconductors to seven nanometers, that's a big challenge. And then, obviously, we're also thinking about, as we indicated what the post-silicon world looks like. So we remain committed to being the leader of high performance and high-end systems. And we have not changed our view on that at all. We've been very vocal about it and we'll stay on that path.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Ben. Let's go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA.
Lou Miscioscia - CLSA
Maybe if I could link something about China, and also your x86 business. I guess the question is that, we continuously hear that the Chinese government is pushing away from big U.S. tech companies, but obviously the x86 business bounce back, and it sounds like China bounced back, is the sale of that helping the situation there? And I guess I'll leave at that.
Martin Schroeter
Again, we saw a sequential improvement, as I noted earlier in China quarter-to-quarter. And as I also noted, we would expect that sequential improvement to continue. Now, interestingly I would not characterize that sequential improvement as driven solely by x86 or any other of the single brands, in fact, it was across all of our segments, Global Technology Services, GBS, Software group, STG, all showed sequential improvement in China.
And in fact, when we look at our strategic imperatives content that sits in China that was up very solid double-digit as well, which is consistent with the overall performance and our strategic imperatives. So really no difference from what we're seeing in our success in China from what we're seeing anywhere else in the world.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Lou. Chris, can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS.
Steve Milunovich - UBS
Couple of odds and ends, Martin. First of all on these share repurchase, you did I think $11.8 billion through the first half. Does that mean you have roughly $3 billion to do in the second half? And then second, on emerging markets, I think in the annual report that you guys suggested you would see emerging market revenue growth in the second half? Is that correct? And does that still stand?
Martin Schroeter
So on share repurchase, we have about $3 billion left on our authorization. And as we've said in the past, we would expect to spend about what we did last year, maybe a little bit less or something. I haven't changed my view on that capital allocation. But we do have about $3 billion left in our authorization.
On growth markets, as I mentioned earlier, I would say that we would say a continued sequential improvement in growth markets. And as I noted earlier, L.A is going to ramp on a strong second half, but continues to do quite well. AP we do not see that sequential improvement yet.
And I guess the other thing I'd point that's worth noting, particularly in the growth markets, we are in the process, as you know of divesting our industry standard server business, and that's going to have an impact on our revenue growth and that's a profound impact in the emerging markets as well. So when we sell that content, its going to be a pretty big headwind to growth for the emerging markets, notwithstanding the sequential improvements that we see in the business.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Steve. Let's go to the next question please.
Operator
The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.
Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan
Just wanted to ask about the GBS portion of services. I saw revenue accelerated, and margins contracted a bit. Curious, how much of this is cyclical versus secular? I heard pricing pressure and package limitation weakness. Did you adjust your workforce last quarter to address these things? Just trying to sketch out what the second half might look like given this trend?
Martin Schroeter
So a couple of things on GBS. So there are secular shifts going on this space. And we've been talking about our, how we're shifting towards, we refer to it as the Digital Front Office. So to talk about it as our cloud and analytics and our mobile, that was that while we see that flow in our clients and we're obviously shifting both their resources, our skills, our training after that and we see very solid double-digit growth, we saw that in the second quarter.
And in fact, we look at our pipeline going forward and over half of it is that kind of content. So there is absolutely a secular shift going on in that GBS space. And we are in the middle of it. And we are very competitive in that space.
On the ERP implementations, and some of the custom development work, I guess what we are seeing is kind of a fewer of those large rollouts and that combined with the large rollouts that do occur, we're seeing them being broken up into small pieces. So they're not as large as they used to be.
So I don't know, if I would consider that secular or cyclical, within that our clients where those back office workloads are stable, our clients are still looking for additional productivity. And so obviously, we are in a bit of a battle to win there, but they are looking for productivity. And so we are still competitive. But other than the absolute secular shift towards cloud and analytics and mobile, which we're playing in and which we have very solid double-digit growth in, we'll have to wait and see if the rest is secular or cyclical.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Tien-Tsin. Can we go to the next question please?

The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank
I wanted to dig a little bit into what you're hearing in terms of global demand and thinking about the second half of the year. Are you hearing that businesses are starting to get a little more confident? I think you made some comments about the developed markets being a bit better. And then thinking about that in terms of how it translates, since the second half of the year, do you think you could start to see some flat or potentially some growth in revenue?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. So if we look at our major, we'll start with our major markets performance. And so I've talked a bit about the growth markets. Already, in major markets, we were flat year-to-year when we exclude our customer care business, which was an improvement sequentially in North America.
And we also did quite well in North America in our mainframe business and we saw sequential improvements in some of our other platforms as well including power and storage and X. So there is a sequential improvement story, if you will, in North America business that we certainly benefited from in the second.
In Europe, we saw a decline at constant currency, but we did see within that growth in our Services business. And so I would expect Europe to see sequential improvement going forward, but it is a challenged environment from our experience.
And then in Japan, we had a very solid performance again in Japan. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of growth in Japan, as we noted in the remarks that our Japan team does quite well. And I think it's more than just macro. I think our Japan team is doing quite well.
And then as I mentioned in the growth markets, we do expect to see sequential improvement going forward. And then again, all of this is in context from our own headwinds here in IBM. We have closed on our customer care divestiture, which is a headwind for the rest of us, for the year, for a bit over 1 point. And then, as I noted earlier in my growth markets commentary, if we're able to close our industry standard server, our X series divestiture that will also have a pretty substantial headwind for us as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Sherri. Can we please take one last question?
Operator
The last question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald
Martin, when we think about the Systems & Technology business, the profitability has swung from, looks like $1.6 billion in 2011 to negative $300 million in 2013. Could you just delve into what was the biggest driver of that decline? And I also just want some clarity, do you think this business will be profitable in 2014?
Martin Schroeter
We are still focused, as we talked about in the beginning of the year, we are still focused on stabilizing the STG profit base for the year, right, the Systems & Technology Group profit base for the year. And I believe, we are absolutely on track to do that to stabilize that profit base. The impacts against that profit base, when we look last year and what we're trying to stabilize, there are, one, some cyclical issues.
We have certainly seen this downturn in the emerging markets, which has an impact on hardware. And we've talked about that on prior calls that the mix of our STG business in the growth markets is higher than other places. And therefore, that emerging market slowdown had a more pronounced effect on STG. And so there is some cyclical issues there.
And then we have talked about the mainframe cycle, already a number of times. But in addition to that, we've had this secular issue around Power and trying to reposition that. And we've taken action pretty aggressively to make that platform the most viable for the future, including we just released POWER8, as an example, which is a Power platform built for the world of big data and analytics, and quite frankly, built for the world of cloud.
And then we've also had a lot of success with our OpenPOWER initiative, which we've been able to expand again the alliance, being able to expand the alliance of those who will use and build on top of that. So a mix of cyclical and secular within that STG performance, but as I said, as we said at the beginning of the year, and we are confident with the actions we've taken, both address the secular, and also we've taken a fair bit of cost out of that business to better suit the demand profile, we still see that business stabilizing in profit on a full year basis.
So I'm going to wrap up the call. And I guess, first I'll start with what we saw in the first half. We had very strong performance in the strategic imperatives, a lot of software content within that. And as we talked about it at Investor Day, that's very important for our business model. The core franchises were relatively stable, that's also as we said at Investor Day, important for our business model. And we made some progress in addressing some of those secular issues in POWER8. I talked a little bit about that in answer to a question.
In the second half, we see, as I noted on an earlier question, we see our Software revenue growth accelerating to mid-single digit. And we see our Services profit growth of mid-single digit, driven by productivity in the base. And then on STG, as I just noted, we see that profit stabilization still. So when I think about the second half and how that plays out, as we did 90 days ago, I said that I think EPS in the second half will be a little bit faster in the fourth than in the third.
So kind of a double-digit fourth quarter EPS and a single-digit third quarter EPS. And bear in mind, that that single-digit EPS growth even in the third because of seasonality kind of translates to no more absolute EPS than what we get in the second. So we still see that same mix skewed toward the fourth quarter, when we have the benefit of very strong Software performance, when the productivity hits and helps our margins and services and we get that transactional benefit from STG.
Well, thanks very much, everyone. Thanks for joining us. And have a good evening.

Martin Schroeter - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Finance and Enterprise Transformation
Thank you for joining us today. As we get into the first quarter results, you will see that our performance reflects the actions we talked about in our last call. We are transitioning to key growth areas and transforming parts of the business. In the quarter, we announced a $1.2 billion investment to globally expand our SoftLayer cloud hubs. We launched BlueMix, our new platform-as-a-service to speed deployment of hybrid clouds. We acquired both Aspera and Cloudant to extend our capabilities in big data and cloud. We are expanding our ecosystem around OpenPOWER. And we created an integrated business unit around Watson and announced $1 billion dollar investment to bring cognitive capabilities to the enterprise.
As we move to these growth areas, we are also taking portfolio actions to divest businesses that no longer fit our strategic profile. In January, we had the initial closing for the divestiture of our customer care BPO business and we announced the sale of our industry standard server business to our partner, Lenovo. This quarter, as expected, we took a substantial charge to align our resources and skills to the demand profile we see. This charge impacts our results this quarter, but it will pay back within the year. So, we got a lot done this quarter. Many of these actions impact our top and bottom line in the short-term, but have long-term benefits.
For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $22.5 billion and operating EPS of $2.54. Our software performance was driven by 5% constant currency growth in key branded middleware. We are continuing to see strong client demand and great results in areas like mobile, cloud and security, where we have been targeting our investments. Our services business was up 2% at constant currency, with growth in both services segments, adjusting for the sale of the customer care business. The growth reflects our expanded cloud offerings, the ramp in some of the large outsourcing contracts we signed last year, and good performance in both consulting and systems integration.
Looking at hardware, as expected, the combination of secular and cyclical challenges continued. Last quarter, I talked about business model challenges specific to power, storage and System x. Let me tell you about some of the actions we have taken. As I mentioned, we are selling our industry standard server business to Lenovo. We are repositioning power and building an ecosystem around OpenPOWER and we have taken actions across power and storage to right-size the business to the market dynamics. Our System z performance in both revenue growth and margin reflects that we are six quarters into the product cycle, though on solid ground secularly.
Looking at the financial metrics for our operating results this quarter IBM’s revenue was down 4% or 1% at constant currency adjusting for the customer care divestiture. That’s a 2 point sequential improvement from our fourth quarter rate. We had constant currency growth in software, services and financing, which was more than offset by a decline in systems and technology. The currency impact to revenue growth was about a point and a half. Currency was also a headwind to our profit performance, reflecting impacts from the yen and the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.
This quarter, we improved gross margin by 90 basis points, driven by services and our ongoing mix to software. The profit dynamics below the gross profit line are impacted by the charge of nearly $900 million for workforce rebalancing, as well as a gain of about $100 million for the sale of our customer care business and so are not representative of our future run-rate. Our pre-tax income was down 19% and net income down 22%. Within net income, our tax rate was worse by 2.7 points year-to-year. The 20% rate in the quarter reflects our view of the annual operating tax rate for 2014.
This quarter, we returned significant value to shareholders, including over $8 billion of gross share repurchases and $1 billion in dividends. We generated free cash flow of $600 million, which was down $1.1 billion year-to-year. In January, we highlighted a substantial cash tax headwind for 2014. This was skewed to first quarter and cash tax payments were up $1.4 billion year-to -year. So without the cash tax increase, our free cash flow was up $300 million.
So now, I will get into the details of the quarter, starting with revenue by geography on a constant currency basis. Americas’ revenue was down 2% year-to-year, consistent with last quarter’s performance. We had strong growth in software, but hardware performance, especially in the U.S. remains challenged. Once again, we had good performance in Latin America, led by Brazil. EMEA was up 1%. The improvement was driven by a return to growth in both Germany and Italy. In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 6%. Within that, we had another good quarter in Japan. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan. Asia-Pacific outside of Japan declined. In total, major markets were down 1% with improvement from last quarter’s performance driven by EMEA.
The growth markets were down 5%. And within the growth markets, we had high single-digit growth in Latin America. But revenue from the Asia-Pacific countries declined at a double-digit rate, with continued weakness in China. Our revenue in China was down 20%, so pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. We expect it will take some time for our business in China to improve, because we view the bulk of the challenges in the growth markets as cyclical, and we still see good opportunity over the long-term, we are continuing to invest in these key markets to capture that opportunity.
Turning to the segment perspective, I have already commented on the revenue drivers and will address those further in the services, software and hardware discussions. Looking at the gross profit, in total, our operating gross margin improved 90 basis points. We expanded margins in both services segments and the relative strength in our software business drove an improving mix. The improvements are mitigated by a 5 point decline in systems and technology. The systems decline is driven by a combination of margin degradation in power and storage and a mix away from higher margin z due to the product cycle. Consistent with these product cycle dynamics, our margin in System z is up year-to-year.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 8% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth, while currency was fairly neutral to expense performance. So, what we have labeled as base expense on the chart, which is total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency, was up 7 points.
There are a couple of larger items that are impacting this base expense. First, SG&A includes a workforce rebalancing charge of about $870 million, nearly all of which is a year-to-year increase. We expect this to pay back within the year. The workforce rebalancing activity impacted the SG&A base performance by 16 points. So, without the charges in both years, our SG&A base expense would have been better 3 points year-to-year. And second, within other income and expense, you see the gain of nearly $100 million from the sale of our customer care business. We anticipate a gain of a similar amount in the second quarter as we complete the country closings. Adjusting for both of these items, our total base expense would have been better by 4 points rather than worse by 7 points. The 4 point improvement is more indicative of the productivity in the base expense we delivered in the quarter.
I want to comment on another dynamic in our base expense. Within the base, we are continuing to shift our spending. So, for example, the $1.5 billion of R&D spending this quarter reflects the shift of development priorities to where we see future growth. Our recent launch of BlueMix is a great example. We will be investing a $1 billion to deliver unique platform-as-a-service capabilities to connect enterprise data and applications to the cloud. We will talk more about how we are shifting investments in our Investor Briefing in May.
Now, let’s turn to the segments and we’ll start with Services. This quarter, the combined Services segments generated $14 billion in revenue, which was down 2% as reported and modest growth at constant currency. Adjusting for the customer care divestiture, total services were up 2% at constant currency, the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Services pre-tax profit was down 14% and margin declined by 1.9 points. Without the workforce rebalancing charges in both years, profit was up 7% and margin expanded by 1.5 points. Total backlog was $138 billion, which includes a reduction of $3.8 billion for the customer care divestiture. Backlog was up 1% at constant currency when adjusted for the divestiture.
Turning to the two segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% as reported and down 1% at constant currency, but up 2% at constant currency adjusting for the divestiture. Within GTS, our SoftLayer platform provides a highly differentiated solution for clients looking to deploy across public, private, or hybrid clouds, unified on one platform. The range and scope of production workloads has been expanding, we have good growth in enterprise transformation projects and the introduction of BlueMix has generated broad interest with application developers. This quarter, SoftLayer contributed about a point to GTS’ revenue growth.
As I mentioned earlier, we are spending $1.2 billion to expand our global cloud footprint. We will double our SoftLayer centers, and with 40 cloud datacenters in 15 countries, IBM will have cloud centers in every major geography and key financial center. GTS Outsourcing returned to growth at 1% constant currency adjusted for the divestiture. Growth was driven by the substantial new contracts we brought on during 2013. GTS pretax profit declined 15% in the quarter. This includes a 20 point year-to-year impact from workforce rebalancing charges. GTS pretax profit also includes a gain of about $100 million for the divestiture. Keep in mind that GTS profit is impacted by the divestiture of those operations. In addition, we are continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as mobility, security, and cloud. And these initiatives are gaining traction, but are not yet at scale.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, flat year-to-year as reported and up 2% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration grew 5% at constant currency, driven by the practices that address the Digital Front Office. We delivered growth across cloud and business analytics and we had good success in projects for clients on systems of engagement and helping clients connect these new front end capabilities to their back end systems and processes. In fact we are ranked number one in Overall Business Consulting and Cloud Professional Services by IDC, and number one in Mobility Consulting Services by Forrester, a good indication of our success in front office transformations. We are continuing to invest strategically and in March we committed $100 million to expand our consulting services capability with 10 new IBM Interactive Labs and 1,000 employees to address client experience design and engagement.
Application Outsourcing was down 8% at constant currency. Our performance reflects increased pricing pressure and client contract renegotiations, as well as a reduction in elective projects. Turning to profit, GBS declined 11% year-to-year. Without the workforce rebalancing charges, profit would have been up double digits, reflecting improved productivity in the base.
Software revenue was up 2% to $5.7 billion. Key branded middleware grew 5% at constant currency. Our enterprise clients continue to rely on IBM’s middleware solutions to transform their infrastructure, and handle their business-critical transactions. We deliver this through a combination of on-premise and SaaS solutions. Our SaaS offerings span our software brands, and this quarter our SaaS revenue grew more than 25% year-to-year.
Looking at our results by brand, WebSphere had another strong quarter, up 12% year-to-year, led by app server and mobile solutions. We continue to have strong growth in MobileFirst, our comprehensive portfolio of mobile software and services that enables our clients to manage, integrate and leverage mobile devices. We have been building capabilities to address this space and we now have over 3,000 mobile experts. Across software and services, IBM’s mobile business doubled from the prior year. Our application server business delivered strong growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. This is an example of our clients utilizing on-premise software to manage the infrastructure workloads driven by mobile, big data and analytics. This is the 13th year in a row that Gartner named IBM the market share leader in application infrastructure and middleware software, and with 30 % market share, we are nearly double the size of our closest competitor.
Information Management software was up 2% at constant currency. Growth was led by distributed database and master data management, which are key elements of our big data and analytics solutions. This quarter we added DataBase-as-a-Service capability with the acquisition of Cloudant. Cloudant extends IBM’s mobile and cloud platforms by enabling developers to easily and quickly create next generation mobile and web applications. Tivoli grew revenue 7%. This quarter we had growth in all three of Tivoli’s product segments, systems management, storage, and security. Security grew double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our results are being driven, in part by incremental requirements for security as clients expand into cloud and mobile computing. Our portfolio of security offerings across IBM grew more than 20% this quarter.
Workforce Solutions declined 4% at constant currency. Strong growth in our SaaS offerings were more than offset by a decline in our on-premise Notes business. We are transforming our business and building up the recurring streams from SaaS. I mentioned earlier that in the first quarter we launched BlueMix, which will make all of our middleware accessible via the cloud. With BlueMix, developers can efficiently build cloud applications with reusable pieces of code tied to their enterprise systems. This enables businesses to leverage the flexibility that cloud applications provide.
Systems and Technology revenue of $2.4 billion was down 23%. This reflects both the product cycle of System z, and the secular challenges in Power, Storage and System x. In January, we entered into a definitive agreement with Lenovo to divest our System x business. And in the first quarter, we continued to reposition offerings in other parts of our hardware business to make them more relevant and we took actions to align our structure to the demand profile we see.
Looking at our results this quarter, System z revenue was down 40%, with MIPS down 19% year-to-year. We are in our sixth quarter of the product cycle, and gross profit margin was up year-to-year, consistent with this point in the cycle. System z is a core franchise which provides mission critical infrastructure for our customers and we continue to invest in the platform. It’s worth noting that earlier this month we celebrated the mainframe’s 50th year. Power revenue declined 21% at constant currency. We are aggressively repositioning this platform with a couple of key initiatives. First, the OpenPOWER consortium makes Power technology available to an open development alliance. This quarter we expanded our OpenPOWER ecosystem. And second, we are expanding our Linux capabilities through our POWER8 launch this year. POWER8 is the first processor built for big data and delivers better cloud economics.
Storage hardware revenue was down 23%. Our Flash solutions contributed growth again this quarter, however we saw substantial weakness in high-end storage. As we have discussed, our focus for STG in 2014 is to stabilize the profit base. The repositioning of the Power platform, the announcement of POWER8, new announcements in storage, and the right-sizing of the business will all contribute as we move through the rest of the year. This, together with the divestiture of System x, will result in a smaller and more profitable hardware business going forward. IBM will remain a leader in high-performance and high-end systems, in storage and in cognitive computing and we will continue to invest in R&D for advanced semiconductor technology.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $600 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which is down $1.1 billion year-to-year. As you can see, our CapEx was up nearly $200 million year-to-year, which includes investment in additional SoftLayer capacity. But the real driver of the year-to-year decline was $1.4 billion increase in tax payments, driven by audit settlement payments and other prior period discrete tax impacts that settled this quarter. Excluding the increased tax payments, free cash flow would have been up $300 million year-to-year.
Looking at the uses of our cash, we spent almost $300 million on acquisitions, acquiring Aspera and Cloudant. We returned $9.2 billion to shareholders, including a $1 billion in dividends and we bought back over 45 million shares for $8.2 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had $6.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. I want to remind you that our free cash flow generation is always skewed to the back end of the year. In fact, if you look over the last 10 years, the average free cash flow generated in the first quarter is less than 5% of our full year total.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.7 billion, which was down $1.4 billion from December. Total debt was $44 billion, which includes $28.3 billion to support our financing business. The leverage in our financing business remains at seven to one. Our non-financing debt was $15.7 billion and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 55%. Given the skew of free cash flow, we expect our debt-to-cap to be in the 50’s for the next two quarters and roughly flat year-to-year at year end.
So now let me wrap up the discussion on the quarter. There are major shifts in our industry driven by data, cloud, and changes in the way individuals are engaging. This quarter we had good performance in our offerings that address these shifts. Our business analytics revenue was up 6% at constant currency on a large base. Our cloud revenue was up over 50%, with doubling of our cloud as a service business and we had strong growth in mobile and security.
Just as importantly, we continue to take significant actions to move to these growth areas. I talked about some of the targeted investments we are making, including SoftLayer capacity, BlueMix, and Watson. We are focused on allocating our capital efficiently and effectively, which means investing in the right places, as well as moving away from areas that don’t support our shift to higher value. This is an important part of our model. In fact, over the last few years, including the recently announced sale of our industry standard server business, we have divested over $6 billion of revenue. The result is a stronger, more relevant business.
As we look to the balance of 2014, we continue to expect good performance in the key growth areas, though our overall revenue growth will be impacted by the challenges in our hardware business and the customer care divestiture. The currency impact to revenue moderates at current spot rates, but we do expect currency to continue to impact profit. Our margin will reflect the ongoing productivity initiatives and actions to improve our cost base, as well as the relative strength of software. And as always, we reinvest some of the productivity savings to drive our growth areas. I mentioned earlier that our annual effective tax rate for 2014 is 20%, and that’s before any potential discrete tax items. And of course, we will continue to return value to our shareholders.
For the year, we expect to deliver at least $18 of operating earnings per share. This does not include any gain from the sale of our System x business to Lenovo, because of the uncertainty of the timing and the amount, but it will ultimately be included in our operating EPS results and we’ll update you later in the year. Like always, we manage our business and allocate capital for the long-term, and along the way we still expect to deliver at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy - Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Chris, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we would like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Yes, thank you Martin. I was hoping that you could confirm that you still expect to meet your free cash flow goal for this year of $16 billion? And secondly, in terms of goal setting, you now have a much lower tax rate for the full year than you anticipated three months ago? I think that’s going to add about $0.70 to EPS that was not anticipated three months ago. You also mentioned there maybe discrete items. So I would like to understand on that a) why the tax rate changed so significantly in three months and secondly, do you have anticipated discrete items over the course of the year and can you share those with us?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Toni. I guess, first on free cash flow as we noted in the prepared remarks, our free cash flow was $600 million in the quarter and down about $1.1 billion year-to-year. Now, as we noted that’s it represents – the first quarter always represents a fairly small amount. Now, to answer your question, I am going to go through some math in a second, but to answer your question, we still do expect to grow free cash flow year-to-year even though we do have a tax headwind this year.
So, the short answer to your question is yes, we still expect to grow free cash flow. When we adjust – when we look at our free cash flow on a year-to-year basis and we start to put in a more normal like a model tax rate if you will. So we had as you can see in our data big tax headwind, but in total, we paid about $2.6 billion of cash taxes in the year. So that’s an 80% rate in the quarter. Obviously, that’s not a rate driven by – our model is not driven by the way the business runs, but it just reflects really the tax audit that we finished in the fourth quarter and the related payments around that. So we had a very high rate in the quarter. Last year, we had a rate of about 30%. And so that $1.4 billion year-to-year, which we identified as driving – would have driven $300 million year-to-year. The factors on kind of a rate adjusted or model basis, we would have grown faster again. So, I am very comfortable with the free cash flow generation in the business.
I think we are on track to deliver the full year and the cash flow growth. Again, we do have a headwind this year or the bulk of it was in the first quarter. On the tax rate, we were able to improve our expected full year operating rate to 20% with a more favorable mix of geographic income. And our income in intercompany dividend plans resulted in higher usage of foreign tax credits for the year. So, that’s our operating tax rate. The rate, however, as you noted and as we put in the prepared remarks excludes any potential discrete tax impacts, which may occur. And those are as you know generally for non-recurring items. So, two examples that could affect our rate from here: first, we did announce the sale of our x series business, now that hasn’t closed, but that could affect the rate. So the rate could be the higher from the sale of the Lenovo business. At the same time, I am sure you are aware that there are bills being discussed in Washington, tax extender bills which lower the rate further. So, our operating rate of 20% is ultimately going to reflect not only our mix of geographic income and the intercompany dividend plan, which rolls into that operating tax rate, but it’s ultimately going to reflect the discrete.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs
Okay, great. Thanks. I just wanted to get a clarification on Toni’s question for the full year guidance. I mean, given the lower tax rate, as Toni mentioned, you are still offering the same EPS guidance. So, without the lower tax rate, it is a net guide down. So if so, could you comment on what exactly has changed above the tax line versus your prior expectations and the expectations you gave us in January?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, sure. So we got a lot done in the first quarter. I mentioned some of those in my prepared remarks, right. And roughly speaking if I were to net it down, we continue to move our investments and our resources to where we see the needs of our enterprise clients and we continue to – we divested a pretty substantial business in x series that didn’t fit our high-value model. So though we did get a lot done in the quarter, now we also as you would expect look at the trajectory we see coming out of the quarter in order to get the right guidance for the year. And I guess I’d go through it – I’ll go through it by segment, but first I think it’s important to note that we did not see much improvement in the trajectory in the GMU in the quarter. We were down 5% in the first quarter. We were down 6% in the fourth quarter. So, we are not seeing a trajectory improvement. GBS, as an example, just within the GMU went from high single-digit growth to low single-digit growth. So, we are not seeing the trajectory improve in the GMU as an example.
Now, looking at the segments at a higher level or the complete segment view, in services, when you adjust for the charge we took, because again, we will earn that charge back through the year. When you adjust for that charge, we did expand margin in the first quarter. And we would expect that to continue. So, in services, relative to last year when we grew profit in low single-digits, we are really only canning on kind of mid single-digit growth across those businesses. In software, we continue to see an improving growth rate in software and revenue, which obviously drives profitability. And then in hardware, hardware was down 23% constant currency. And we expect both the cyclical and the secular challenges that we see in that space to continue. So, as we said in the last call, our focus in hardware is really to stabilize that profit base on a year-to-year basis. So, we do see the ships we are making into the growth areas are absolutely the right things to do. We are being successful in growing that part of the business and our 1Q trajectory really reflects I think no real improvement in the GMU.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Bill. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore. You may ask your question.
Rob Cihra - Evercore
Hi, thank you very much. If you look at the hardware losses and with divesting the x86 business, I mean that will help margins, but it won’t necessarily change your cost structure that much. I am wondering, I mean, is it that this business is now just subscale, particularly including the microelectronics business or do you think it’s you are just unfortunately at the bottom of mainframe and power cycles? And when you include the POWER8 and you include the power on Linux, you think you can sort of grow your way out of it or do you think it’s sort of an actual cost structure that’s now just too high for the business? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Yes. I’d say a few things, Rob. First, we – the mainframe revenue growth, absolutely reflects where we are in the cycle. There is not a secular challenge in mainframe at all. So the mainframe growth rates are absolutely cyclical and when we – when it’s not a scale when we get to announce the new mainframe that will absolutely turn. In Power, as we have said last time we did have too much structure there was a secular issue in Power particularly at the low end. Now we have said we were going to address that with a few different actions. First, we have said OpenPOWER will be a tremendous benefit to opening up that technology and getting more users on that platform. And we think OpenPOWER over the long-term will have a pretty solid impact and improving that platform. Secondly, we said that we have POWER8 coming. We had this in the prepared remarks and POWER8 is highly relevant to big data workloads relevant to the cloud. And so the secular move from low end power on to industry based servers we will battle back with POWER8 in a much better offering in that space. And then thirdly, we did have too much structure on POWER8 – I am sorry in Power. And we did manage to get a fair bit of structure out of that business to set a cost base into the Power platform.
In total on STG, let’s go back to the total for a second. There is obviously a GP margin impact in the first quarter, down year-to-year. Some of that is obviously driven by the mainframe cycle and its lack of contribution if you will, lack of mix to the high end. Some of its driven by the cost base, none of the improvements that we have made are really felt in the first quarter. And then it is relative to what’s going to come next in second through fourth it is the lowest transaction volume quarter. So there is a – there is just a high fixed cost base relative to what we have coming forward in the rest of the year. So I think that the STG business is on a path that we will achieve what we set out to achieve at the beginning of the year which was to stabilize that cost base and the profit base.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Rob. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steve Milunovich - UBS
Yes, thank you. You talked about a couple of financial measures first your share repurchase was very large this quarter, could you talk what you anticipate going forward. I am assuming it was pretty front end loaded but kind of what do you see for the full year. And perhaps related to that you had roughly doubled your non-financed debt over the last year, did you say that you would take that ratio from 55% down to roughly 39% by the end of the year which is where you have ended last year?
Martin Schroeter
Sure Steve. So on share repurchase we did front end load this year’s share repurchases. So we would expect on a full year basis to finish probably a little bit less than where we were last year. So we will continue to return capital to shareholders through the rest of the year, but it will be at a reduced rate relative to the first quarter. And then on a debt to capitalization ratio which you noted was 55%, we will probably run in the 50s in the next couple of quarters, but we will be back down to that where we started the year again by the end of the year.
Patricia Murphy
Okay, thanks Steve. Let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays
Hi, I think investors are focused on this, so I am going to just try clarify it on the free cash flow side, what I am really confused about is that the charge was about $100 million lower than I thought then we have the tax rate impact and the accelerated buyback, which was probably more than I think you guys probably modeled in January. So with all that you could have almost $1 billion taken out of the net income the street had and still guide to $18. And I wanted to know on cash flow you said in the 10-K that you would grow cash flow by a $1 billion year-over-year and we just took out almost $1 billion of the net income versus where we were in January. So I actually don’t understand how we get to the free cash flow numbers previously guided in that, taking it now light if you can just explain it that way that will be really great? Thanks a lot?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, so Ben just to clarify again we said at the beginning of the year we would grow free cash flow by $1 billion and we still feel that we will grow free cash flow by $1 billion given where we started the year. Again the year – the first quarter of the year is typically quite like in terms of free cash flow. So when we look at now when we look at the rest of the year in terms of free cash flow obviously we have a pretty substantial transactional business that picks up from first to second quarter and also sticks with us in the third and then the fourth is also a pretty substantial fourth quarter transactional flow which drives a lot of free cash flow for the year. So in the first quarter you are seeing a substantial impact for the in-quarter free cash flow numbers simply because of the size of the tax payments, the cash tax payments that we had to make in the first. Those do not replicate for the rest of the year.
In terms of the $18 we have said we would get to at least we said we get to at least $18. We said in the first quarter that we would do about 14% of that and that’s really came in at 14%. Now, we said about $1 billion of restructuring plus or minus $100 million and that’s kind of where we came in. Now, we had fewer shares, so on EPS base the EPS impact was I think right in the middle of where we would have put the original number. And we did get everything done that we wanted to get done in terms of setting the right cost base. So I think that’s fairly constant.
And then when we look at how the rest of the at least $18 rolls out. We had a big charge in our results in the second quarter of last year. And obviously we are not going to recreate that this year, so you are going to see big growth in the second quarter now given that quarterly phenomenon a charge in the first of this year, but none in the second versus the prior we would think that the first half then given that quarterly phenomenon that first half is going to look a lot like last year. And we will probably get about 38% of our full year EPS done by the end of the first half. And then when we look at the second half we will see kind of consistent growth with what need on a full year basis at 10.5. And given the transactional nature and the momentum in some of our businesses, we would say it probably will be a little bit faster in the fourth and in the third.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Ben. Let’s go to the next question please.

The next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. You may ask your question.
Lou Miscioscia - CLSA
Okay, thank you. Switching over to the services business you talked about it a little bit it seems like GBS did slowed down somewhat maybe consulting system integration was okay with growth rates comparing last quarter and this quarter, but maybe you can go into more detail of that the GBS Outsourcing business?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Los a couple of things GBS 2% growth it is slower quarter-to-quarter. As I mentioned earlier we saw a trajectory in the GMU that was – that went from high single to low single digit growth as an example. The bulk of the slowdown that we noted in the prepared remarks was in the application outsourcing business which was down year-to-year. Now, we have seen pretty substantial price pressure in that space. And as I noted in my prepared remarks clients are absolutely focused on cost take out projects and less focused and have decreasing volumes, but I would consider to be more elective kind of projects. So we are seeing a shift in focus.
Now underneath that though that’s the revenue side, underneath that we do have a robust delivery platform that allows us to manage even in that environment and so from a GP perspective, gross profit perspective we are comfortable that we can continue to deliver profit even in that environment. So you are right as you saw in the data our GBS did slow quarter-to-quarter. We are not expecting that the environment changes dramatically. We are not counting on it to change dramatically. And we do have a pretty robust as I mentioned a pretty robust delivery platform underneath that. And then in total as you saw even with slower revenue growth our profits still grew 12% when you take out the charge. I think it’s important to take out the charge because we are going to earn it back during the year so that’s more indicative of the kind of growth we can still deliver even on low kind of profit growth we can deliver even on a lower revenue trajectory.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Lou. Can we go to the next question, please.

The next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. You may ask your question.
Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott
Hi, I was wondering the growth market seem to be continuing or continuing to be a little bit slow for you. I know that most of your projects there are larger projects and perhaps more profitable than some of your other businesses. How do you plan to make that up in your plans going forward? And any color you can give on a return to steady growth, any of the services business or the aggregate business would be great?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Joe. So, a couple of things, growth markets as you know they were down 5 now. We have been experienced a pretty tough environment in the growth markets for a few quarters now and down 5 as I said earlier is not the kind of trajectory movement we are looking for in that business. Now, when you look at it by region, however, it’s not one that’s not a homogenous answer here. So, in Latin America, we had another good quarter of growth. The Latin America business for us is going really, really well. We are up 8% at constant currency. In the Mideast and in Central Europe, we are about flat. Now, that’s down from growth we have seen before, but about flat is at least hanging in. And our challenge areas have been in China, which was down double-digit and in Asia-Pacific, which was down in the mid single-digit. So, I think there are a blend here of issues. There are cyclical issues. There are secular issues. And they are not consistent between the regions. We have talked in the past about China needing time to return to growth.
We have talked about across the growth markets that we still believe there is a very attractive region for us to invest in. So, we are going to maintain our investments, but there is both a mix of secular and cyclical. Now, we do have very heavier concentration in the growth markets in our STG business than in other parts of the world. And so while the growth markets are certainly impacted by the mainframe cycle like we are in other parts of the world that is not the bulk of the challenge in the GMU even though again STG is a bigger proponent. So, the STG business does – sorry, the GMU business does get impacted by this secular shift in our power business as an example. There is a very difficult price environment in our industry-standard x series business. And I noted earlier that even our GBS business from quarter-to-quarter slowed down a bit. So, mix of secular and cyclical issues some related to our own hardware issues, others related to what the countries themselves see in terms of economic environments, but not a single answer across the region.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Joe. Can we go to the next question please?

The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal
Hi, thank you. In addition, the software revenue, the constant currency growth was a little bit weaker than we were thinking. I was wondering if you could talk about what were the forces that impacted that? And more broadly, as you look at exiting the year on a constant currency basis and excluding dispositions, assuming the x86 business goes, do you think IBM can get to a position whereby revenue growth is flat on a constant currency basis? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, Keith. A couple of things. So, in software, we grow 2 points segment base as our key branded middleware was up 5. We would expect both of those to accelerate as we go through the year. We still see very good – we still see very good software opportunity for our solutions and we see very good software opportunity for the platforms that were building in fact within the key branded middleware you probably noted on our software chart that WebSphere grew 12%. That’s pretty healthy double-digit growth with our core software business. So, we do expect that to – we do expect that to accelerate as we go through the year. Operating systems, particularly power do impact that overall software business. Power operating – the AIX operating system is sold on as a one-time charge. So, as those hardware sales declined for the reasons we talked about that does impact the overall software segment growth. Now, I don’t think we are relying on. I am not relying on power to be coming back strongly, but one as it becomes a smaller part of the overall revenue stream, it has less of an impact. Then quite frankly, as I mentioned earlier, first quarter is our smallest transactional quarter. And so as we see improved transactional flow in the rest of the year, that impact to the overall software revenue growth will decline.
In terms of overall revenue growth for the year, so I’d say a few things. One, we did have an impact from currency in the first quarter, which was about two points. And we do see that now being flat for the rest of the year. Now, interestingly at least I find it interesting, this is the first time since I think it’s 11 quarters, where we have not had a currency headwind at current rates. So as currency moves at least to neutral for us, we won’t be battling that headwind. And again at current rates, we see that through the rest of the year. Obviously, we don’t know where we might be in 90 days. Customer care and I know you said without the dispositions, customer care was about 1 point in the first quarter, but it will be between 1 and 1.5 points for the rest of the year. So, we will be dealing with that. And then I cannot predict when the x series business, the x series divestiture may occur. And so I don’t know what the overall impact will be to the top line.
Now, when we look though at the rest of the year on more of a segment basis, as I mentioned, software we would expect to improve the growth rate, the hardware declines though will continue. Now, we did center cost base at a rate that we can achieve our goal of stabilizing the profit on a year-to-year business, but we do not expect that and we are not counting on those hardware revenue declines to stop. And then GTS and GBS have services, we don’t see dramatically different rates of growth than as we saw in 1Q, which is fine for our model.
Patricia Murphy
Okay, Keith. Thank you. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.
Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald
Yes. Martin, I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mainframe cycle and just remind us how often the mainframe at IBM is refreshed. You talked about it getting a little long in the tooth. It’s a bit of a drag. So how should we think about a refresh? And also power systems, how should we think about that in terms of improving the performance, I mean, you talked about some things I think on the January call, but where are we in improving that performance? Will we see it this year?
Martin Schroeter
Okay. So a couple of things, Brian. I don’t think I said the mainframe was long in the tooth, I cannot imagine those words coming out of my mouth. So I think is as where we would expect six quarters into cycle, this is a very powerful platform for our clients. This drives a lot of value. And I would say we are right in line with where we would expect it to be and there are two, I’d say there are three metrics to look at when we look at where are we in the mainframe cycle. One, we do see – we do typically see this magnitude of a decline in revenue. So that is absolutely consistent. The other thing we see at this point of the cycle is an improving margin. And we saw that as well in the first quarter that margin continues to improve and should through the rest of the cycle.
And then the other thing we look at is program to program MIPS growth. And we see as we have in prior cycles at this point, we see MIPS growth up about 26% relative to the previous cycle, so very good usage, very good usage of that platform in customer environment. So, the mainframe is as I said exactly where we would expect to be in the cycle. On the power side, power is as we said before power is in a bit of a secular – as a secular challenger, particularly at the low end. And we said that it OpenPOWER will will certainly help and we have a few new members that we announced in OpenPOWER in the quarter. Now, that is not going to have a profound impact on our power business in the year. So, I don’t think you should be looking at power. And I don’t think we will be saying that power is going to get better in the year, because of OpenPOWER. We have also – have moved and made that power platform much more relevant in the Linux space, which we have talked about in the past has been a key driver of growth down the line, but again that takes time. You have to get the ISVs on to your platform and we are doing that. We have over 800 ISVs now in that space writing applications for Linux on power.
And then the third thing that’s important from an ecosystem standpoint is to have the most competitive processor in play in the space that you are targeting. And for us, we think POWER8, which was going to target that low end certainly initially is a very powerful processor that is really well-suited to both big data applications and cloud environments. So, those three things will all help. Now, power is not going to turn around right away. In fact, I think 2014 is going to be a difficult year for power, if all you were to do is compare year-to-year revenue growth, but we are absolutely taking the right actions to make that power platform a sustainable and highly attractive economic model for us. We have taken cost out of that base and we are getting the right both technology and ecosystem around it to make sure that it has a long-term future.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Chris, can we please take one last question?
Operator
The last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. You may ask your question.
David Grossman - Stifel
Thank you. Martin, sorry to revisit the cash flow question, but I am still confused about the reconciliation of free cash flow growth and your net income growth, it seems that your EPS guide for the year, if my math is right, implies flattish, maybe even down net income this year? And last quarter, I believe you indicated that some combination of operational performance and working capital improvements would help drive that $1 billion increase year-over-year despite the $2 billion headwind from cash taxes. So, I understand the working capital comment. I understand what happened in the first quarter. However, could you elaborate on the contribution from operational improvement given what appears to be flat to down net income in 2014?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Well, let’s deal with – let’s look at this I guess from a – I will try to do it from a pre-tax income flow and then we will talk obviously to that, then we would add the impact of taxes, which we know is a headwind later in the year and then our capital allocation policy and the EPS driven from share purchase. So, we did in the first quarter we had $3.3 billion of pre-tax income. That had a charge in it as we talked about $900 million. So – and I am going to use kind of big rounded numbers, it will be too hard to do this in million, so I will just billion. So, we have $3.3 billion, we had $900 million charge in that. So, on a base level, that gets us to about $4.2 billion of pre-tax income. Now, we have that for obviously as a starting point for three more quarters and I add back the billion in the charge we took, which we are going to earn back in savings and the $16 billion then goes to $17 billion. So let’s use $17 billion as a base in terms of starting, but starting from the first quarter.
Now, I also noted that the first quarter is our lowest transactional skew. And that what we see as we go through the year is we had about $1 billion in profit growth from transactional business as well as overall volumes in the second through the fourth relative to what we did in the first. That was again was our starting point. So another $3 billion from that transactional growth as we go through the year. So, $17 billion as a base take the base of transactional growth that goes from first to second and carries through fourth, that gets you to 20. And then in the fourth quarter, which is our big transactional quarter, our biggest transactional quarter we see transactional growth and we see this in across the business as we see it in software, especially the heavily transactional business, we see it software and we see it hardware as well, but across the businesses from third to fourth, we had another typically about $3 billion of pre-tax income into the business.
Now, we have different dynamics this year than we did in the fourth quarter of last year. For instance, our hardware business was a much greater drag last year than we would expect it to be this year given the momentum that we expect out of parts of that business, i.e., momentum being described as you know less revenue declines , right. So – and we see pretty good momentum as I noted in our software business. So, that profit base that PTI profit base of about $23 billion with using 1Q as a starting point, again we have a tax rate headwind in the fourth quarter, but we also have a share repurchase benefit here. So, that $23 billion of profit growth drives our free cash flow for the year. And as I said, we still feel like we are going to grow free cash flow by about $1 billion for the year even with the tax headwind.
Martin Schroeter - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Finance and Enterprise Transformation
So, let me wrap up the call. As I said in the beginning, we did get a lot done this quarter. We did transition more of our business into big data and analytics. We continue to move into the cloud. Our cloud platform is very powerful in the marketplace. Good growth in mobile and security. And we have our Investor Day coming up on May 14 and we are looking forward to sharing with everyone more about the capabilities and the investments we are making to drive those businesses. Thanks very much.

Martin Schroeter
Thank you for joining us today. What we will do over the next hour or so is take you through our fourth quarter results, a wrap up of the year and our view of 2014 earnings per share and then we will take your questions.
A month or so ago, before I assumed the CFO job I met with a number of investors and analysts, and one things I took away is that it's important for me to be clear on IBM's 2015 roadmap objective and our ability to achieve the earnings per share, so I want to start out by saying that we continue to expect to deliver at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015. We will talk about 2014 a little later and you will see that our view of 2014 keeps us on track to that objective.
As we get into the fourth quarter results, you will see that our Software, Services and Financing businesses are all on solid ground, but in hardware, as you know, we went to the backend of the mainframe product cycle and we are dealing with some challenges in other areas.
Together, these are impacting our overall results. IBM does have a resilient model based on continuous transformation and we are investing substantially in key opportunity areas. You have seen evidence of that in announcements we have made in the last two weeks and we are rightsizing and repositioning businesses where the market is shifting.
This enables us to move to higher value and lead an enterprise IT. As always, we are positioning our business for the future, and as I noted, we continue to expect to achieve at least $20 in 2015 along the way, so now let me get into the results.
In the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $27.7 billion and operating EPS $6.13, which is up 14% year-to-year. We had a good quarter in software. The performance was broad-based, with constant currency growth in all brands. We had strength in several of the areas where we have targeting our investments like analytics, cloud and security.
Our software revenue was up 4% at constant currency and profit was up 6%. Services' year-to-year revenue performance was consistent with third quarter. GBS again had strong performance, driven by our offerings that address the digitization of the front office and we had continued improvements in the year-to-year performance of strategic outsourcing and GBS. Services revenue was up 1% at constant currency and profit up 2% and we entered the new year with a solid backlog.
Hardware continued to impact our overall performance. We are dealing with some challenges in our hardware business model specific to power, storage and X86. As expected, in System z, we are impacted by the product cycle as we wrap on very strong performance a year ago. Together, these dynamics significantly impacted our revenue growth and profit. In fact, our hardware segment profit was down over $750 million in the quarter and $1.7 billion for the year.
From a geographic perspective, performance in growth markets was mixed though disappointing overall. Looking at our two largest regions, Asia-Pacific was down primarily driven by China, while again we had good performance in Latin America. All together, we posted EPS growth of 14% which we achieved through the combination of continued momentum in key growth areas which drove the mix to higher value software in GBS, yield from productivity initiatives, a modest improvement in our ongoing tax rate along with substantial benefits from tax audit settlements and the effective use of cash to repurchase shares.
The full year had similar dynamics and similar drivers. So for 2013, we delivered $99.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross and net margins and increased our operating EPS 7% to $16.20. Software services and financing, all expanded margins and grew profit while hardware declined. Across our businesses, we had strong performance in Big Data analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security.
Looking at our financial metrics for the quarter, IBM's revenue was down 5% or 3% at constant currency. We had constant currency growth in software, services and financing which was more than offset by a decline in systems and technology. The currency impact to revenue was two points and currency also impacted our profit performance. As we have discussed in the past, a weakening Yen drops largely to the bottom line.
This quarter we improved gross and net margins. Our operating gross margin expanded by 30 basis points driven by services and an improving mix. Our pretax income of $7.4 billion was down 8% and pretax margin to 80 basis points with the declines driven entirely by our hardware business. Net margin expanded, reflecting a lower tax rate. The fourth quarter rate was significantly lower than our normal operating tax rate and includes the settlement of our U.S. tax audit for the three-year period from 2008 to 2010.
We accrued taxes for uncertain tax matters in our normal operating rate. This particular tax audit commenced in late 2011, and concluded with the receipt of the revenue agent report in late November 2013. The conclusion of the audit resulted in a reduction of tax expense, which was previously recorded in our operational tax rate. While the audit closure had the most significant impact, there were additional discrete items impacting the rate in the quarter. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $6.13, again up 14% year-to-year.
Looking at the cash metrics. We generated free cash flow of $8.4 billion in the quarter and returned substantial value to shareholders. For the year, we generated $15 billion in free cash flow which was down $3 billion year-to-year. The decline was driven by our operational performance, higher cash tax payments and changes in working capital. I will talk more about cash flow later in the call. We ended the year with a cash balance of over $11 billion, consistent with year-end 2012.
So now, I will get into the details of the quarter, starting with revenue by geography and on a constant currency basis. America's revenue was down 2% year-to-year. We had strong growth in software. The deceleration in year-to-year performance from last quarter was driven by the impact from the mainframe product cycle, predominantly in the U.S. We grew in Canada and once again we had good performance in Latin America, led by Brazil. Our EMEA revenue was down 2%, consistent with last quarter. Western Europe performed in line with the market and here too we had software performance. In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 6%. Within that, we had another good quarter in Japan where revenue was up 4%. Japan is a great example of how we have shifted our investment and redirected your go to market focus significantly improve our performance. This is now our fifth consecutive quarter revenue growth in Japan. Asia-Pacific, outside of Japan, declined.
In total, major markets were down 2%, while the growth markets were down 6%. Within the growth markets, we continued to gain share and deliver growth in Latin America and in the Middle East and Africa region. Our performance in LA and MEA has been consistently strong in particular Latin America had a difficult compare up 18% last year. In Eastern Europe, the declines moderated while revenue from the Asia-Pacific countries declined at a double-digit rate, primarily driven by China. Our revenue in China was down 23%. So very similar to last quarter. The largest declines in China were in our hardware business. We continue to be impacted by the process surrounding the implementation of a broad-based economic reform plan. While there is more clarity on the overall plan, we continue to believe that it will take some time for our business in China to improve.
To wrap up the discussion of the growth markets, we had good performance in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. And while we are disappointed with our performance in certain regions of the growth markets, we continue to see good opportunity in all regions over the long-term and we are continuing to invest in these key markets.
Turning to the segment perspective, I have already commented on the revenue drivers. Looking at the gross profit, in total, our operating gross margin improved three-tenth of a point. We expanded margins in both Services segments and the relative strength in our software business drove an improving mix.
The improvements are mitigated by a five-and-a-half point decline in Systems and Technology. System z margin is up as you would expect at this point of the product cycle. The other hardware brands were down reflecting business model challenges. I will get into this in the STG section.
Our total operating expense and other income was better by 1% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove two points of expense growth. For the last two-and-a-half years, acquisitions contributed between one and three points of expense growth each quarter. Currency contributed two points of decline, driven almost entirely by translation, so our base expense was better by a point.
Within our base expense, we are continuing to shift our spending. We are driving productivity across the business, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives. Much of the savings is reinvested into the business to drive our growth areas, so what you see here is the net effect of these actions.
Turning to the categories of expense that had year-to-year impacts, there is just one area point out. Our accounts receivable provision was up nearly $16 million year-to-year. Our reserve coverage is up less than 20 basis points, or flat versus September.
Finally, I want to comment on the impact of currency this quarter. In the fourth quarter, the hedge activity across cost and expense was neutral in the period. There was little year-to-year change in the impact from our hedges.
For the last few quarters, we have been significantly impacted by the depreciation of the yen, because our business in Japan is dominated by local services. Without cross-border cash flow to hedge, the impact falls largely to the bottom line. This was the case again in the fourth quarter and at current spot rates would continue through next year, so unfortunately we will be dealing with another your current impacts to the bottom line.
Now let's turn to the segments and we will start with Services. This quarter, the combined Services segments generated $15 billion in revenue, which was down 2% as reported and up 1% at constant currency. Pre-tax profit was up 2% and pre-tax margin expanded by nine-tenth of a point. Total backlog was $143 billion, up 2% at spot rates and up 5% at constant currency. Backlog grew in both, the Transactional and Outsourcing businesses.
Turning to the two segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.9 billion, down 4% or down 1% at constant currency, in line with last quarter's year-to-year performance. Major markets were returned to growth at constant currency for the first time since the first half of 2012, led by Europe while our growth markets performance lagged.
With revenue down 1% at constant currency, our GTS outsourcing performance improved from the third quarter. We are starting to benefit from several of the large transformational contracts we signed earlier in 2013. At the same time, we continue to see a decline in revenue from sales into existing base accounts. This activity tends to be more transactional in nature and can be economically sensitive.
Our GS revenue was flat year-to-year at constant currency. We continue to shift the business toward higher value managed services such as business continuity, security and cloud.
Within our cloud offerings, software contributed one point of revenue growth to total GTS software provides unmatched performance, flexibility and breadth for public and hybrid cloud workloads and we have just made a commitment to significantly expand our global cloud capacity.
Turning to GTS profit, pre-tax profit declined 2% in the quarter. Our growth markets performance contributed to the profit decline. In addition, we are continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as cloud, mobility and security. While these initiatives are starting to contribute to the top line, we will get better profit results as they get to scale. GTS pre-tax margin expanded by four-tenths of a point, the margin improvement was driven by tough-minded spend actions and benefits from the second quarter workforce rebalancing activity.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, up 1% as reported and up 4% at constant currency. This was a good quarter for GBS, and again gained share this quarter. From a geographic perspective, we had growth in each region at constant currency, led by North America and the growth market countries. Japan continued solid performance and Europe grew for the second consecutive quarter.
Looking at the GBS business by offering, growth was driven by the practices, but addressed the digital front office. We delivered double-digit growth in each of our strategic growth initiatives, business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. We have been investing to build capabilities and now have nearly 20,000 resources in GBS focused on the growing digital front-office opportunity. For example, in the area of Big Data, our capabilities span from BAO strategy to front-office analytics to fraud and regulatory compliance and risk management. Within our back office solutions that address the globally integrated enterprise, we again grew in implementation services that support the traditional packaged applications.
Looking at GBS profit. Pretax profit was up 12% year-to-year and PTI margin expanded by two points. The main year-to-year profit drivers were continued benefits from our enterprise productivity initiatives and the second quarter workforce rebalancing. The savings from these actions fueled the investment in our key initiatives.
Now let me take the discussion back up to the total services level. We entered 2014 with a services backlog of $143 billion and as we have said in the past, approximately 70% of revenue in any year is driven by the opening backlog. Looking to 2014, the projected revenue from the backlog is up 1%. The divestiture of our customer care business is expected to close in the first quarter. That will reduce our backlog and impact revenue growth from the backlog by about three points. So overall, we expect revenue from backlog to be down 2%.
Now the balance of the revenue, the other 30% or so comes from yield from current year signings as well as sales and volumes in our existing client base. It also includes software and some of our cloud services which generate in-period revenue that isn't reflected in the backlog. So to wrap up services, in the fourth quarter, we grew revenue, pretax profit and expanded margins. We continued to see the strength in the areas of cloud, business analytics and Smarter Planet and we are investing to extend our capabilities. Our software revenue was $8.1 billion. It was up 3% or 4% at constant currency. Our software revenue continues to mix toward our key branded middleware. With 6% constant currency growth in branded middleware, we gained share.
Looking at the results by brand. We had great performance in WebSphere. Revenue was up 15% at constant currency and we gained share. We had good growth in both our on-premise application server business and newer cloud based offerings. We continued strong growth in MobileFirst as our comprehensive portfolio of mobile software and services extending value to our clients to reach new markets and gain competitive advantage and our core WebSphere offerings of business integration and commerce delivered strong growth. We are continuing to add capabilities in this space. Last week, we closed the acquisition of Aspera, which provides best in class transfer speeds for movement of Big Data.
Information management software grew 5% at constant currency and gained share. We had our strongest growth of the year in our business analytics software offerings, led by business intelligence and Netezza appliances. Distributed database was up double-digits again this quarter.
Tivoli, our security business, once again delivered another great quarter with double-digit growth. The transformation, driven by mobile and cloud computing is raising the importance of security for enterprise customers everywhere. We have been building our capabilities and across software and services, we now have 6,000 security experts worldwide, we have 3,000 patents in security and we have 25 security labs worldwide.
Our software value proposition remains strong for enterprise clients. Our customers continue to increase deployment for middleware products and we are investing and gaining share in social, mobile, analytics, cloud and security. Some of this has delivered in a SaaS model and we now have over 100 SaaS offerings in our software portfolio. In 2013, software revenue grew 3% at constant currency with key branded middleware up 6% year-to-year. Our software pretax income of over $11 billion was up 3% and we expanded pretax margins.
Systems and technology revenue of $4.3 billion, was down 26% year-to-year. System z was down 37% against a very strong quarter a year ago when revenue was up 56%. This quarter we entered the backend of the mainframe cycle and as expected we delivered a higher gross margin on a lower base of revenue. MIPS declined 26% following the largest MIPS shipment in mainframe history a year ago.
Let me put the performance of the current mainframe cycle into perspective. In the current cycle, we have shipped 28% more MIPS, a measure of capacity, compared to the same period in the prior cycle. The revenue and gross profit in the current cycle are each about 99% of the previous cycle, net of currency. Mainframe provides the highest levels of availability, reliability, efficiency and security which positions it as the ideal platform for high-volume, mission-critical workloads. This additional capacity that I mentioned is a reflection of the ongoing relevance of the mainframes to our clients and provides IBM with financial returns consistent with the past cycles.
In our Power business revenue declined 31%. We continue to shift significant capacity into the UNIX market, however this has been more than offset by significant price performance resulting in lower revenue.
As we have said in the past, we have been very successful in the UNIX market and we are talking two actions to improve our business model here. First, we are making the platform more relevant to clients. To achieve this, in the fourth quarter, we introduced a new integrated facility for Linux offerings, which enables our clients to run Linux workloads in their existing servers. This near-to-successful strategy we executed our System z platform will expand our Linux relevancy even further with POWER8 later this year, which will provide additional Big Data and cloud capabilities.
Through our OpenPOWER Consortium, we are making Power technology available to open development alliance building ecosystem around our technologies. Just yesterday, the Suzhou PowerCore Technology Company announced their intention to use IBM's power architecture to provide customized chip design solutions for the China server market. These effects will take some time.
Secondly, even with these additional capabilities, we recognize that the power platform will not return to prior revenue levels. We will take action in this business to reflect the new business model.
System x 15% at constant currency, within that PureSystems continues to gain momentum. Across our hardware products Pure revenue was up more than 30%, sequentially. Globally, we shipped over 2,500 systems in the fourth quarter and over 10,000 systems to-date.
Storage hardware revenue was down 12% at constant currency. Our Flash solutions continue to gain momentum and contributed a few points of growth this quarter. Our store-wise products again delivered double-digit growth, which was offset by declines in our legacy OEM midrange offerings. We also had declines in the high-end, driven by significant pricing pressure.
Profit in Systems and Technology segment was down over $750 million in the quarter and over $1.7 billion for the year. About half of the fourth quarter decline was driven by System z, due to the product cycle though the platform is secularly strong with a solid business model. Our other harbor businesses are dealing with business model issues, due to market shifts. We will make these products more relevant while rightsizing these businesses to meet the new value proposition.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $8.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $6.2 billion quarter-to-quarter, but down $1.1 billion year-to-year. This was a similar quarter-to-quarter increased to what we saw on the third to fourth quarter of 2012, despite the fact that this year we did not have the benefit of the z cycle.
Historically, over half of our annual cash flow was generated in the fourth quarter. In 2013, we generated 56% of the full year in the fourth quarter and this is the highest percentage in several years.
On a full-year basis, we generated $15 billion of free cash flow, which was down $3.2 billion year-to-year. There were three key drivers of the year-to-year decline. Our operational performance, higher cash taxes and changes in sales cycle working capital. This was mitigated by lower capital expenditures and the fact that we prepared certain retiree medical payments in 2012.
As for the uses of cash for the year, we spent $3.1 billion to acquire 10 companies, including three in the fourth quarter Now Factory, Xtify, and Fiberlink. We also returned almost $18 billion to shareholders in 2013, including over $4 billion in dividends and we bought back 73 million shares for approximately $14 billion. On a net basis, our cash outflow for share repurchases was $12.8 billion, and at the end of the year we had $14.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $11.1 billion. Total debt was $39.7 billion of which $27.5 billion was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at roughly seven-to-one. Our non-financing debt was $12.2 billion and our non-financing debt to cap was 39%.
We had good performance in our pension plans in 2013. The interest rate environment resulted in higher discount rates at year end, particularly in the U.S. and the pension liability re-measurement resulted in an increase to our equity.
Our defined benefit qualified plans had solid asset returns and continue to be well-funded and importantly, our cash requirements remain stable. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long-term.
Let me start to wrap up with a discussion of the full year from a few perspectives,
starting with performance in some key growth areas. We have been continuing to shift our investments to address the key trends in IT, like social, mobile, big data analytics and cloud. A few years ago, we identified and established objectives for three growth initiatives, Smarter Planet, business analytics and cloud that capture much of these trends. I have talked about how these growth areas have contributed to our performance within the segments and I want to report on how they have done at an IBM level for the year.
Smarter Planet grew about 20% year-to-year with strength across all areas, including smarter commerce, industry solutions, smarter cities and social business. We believe that data as a natural resource will drive demand going forward and Big Data analytics to provide the basis for competitive differentiation. In 2013, we grew business analytics revenue 9%, led by GBS and by software. This is now nearly $16 billion business for us which you will recall was our original target for 2015. We have already taken our 2015 objective for business analytics revenue up to $20 billion.
Now cloud solutions address the full scope of customer requirements, private clouds, public clouds and hybrid clouds as well as platform and SaaS based solutions. For the year we delivered $4.4 billion of revenue for cloud solutions. That's up 69% year-to-year and within that $1.7 billion was delivered as a service. As we have said in the past, there is overlap between these initiatives. In total, software makes up about half of that combined content. This improves our business mix and contributes to our margin expansion.
Now looking at 2013 from a segment perspective. Our software business continued to grow fueled by these key areas. We returned to revenue growth in GBS, leveraging the investments we have made in the digital front office and our GTS revenue trajectory improved and is stabilizing. In software, services and financing, we grew profit and expanded margin.
Clearly, we do have some underperforming areas. First, we have a business model issue in parts of our hardware business, which we will address through targeted investments in areas like Flash and PowerLinux and by rightsizing for the demand characteristics we expect. Second, we had recent declines in some of the growth markets where we will continue to invest to capture the longer-term opportunity. Keep in mind, we are dealing with a currency headwind and at current spot rates, this will continue into 2014.
In 2013, we continued the transformation of the portfolio shifting to higher value. We maintained high levels of investment including $6 billion in R&D, $4 billion in capital and $3 billion in acquisitions, adding significant capabilities to support key areas of growth. At the same time, we announced the divestiture of our customer care business, which we expect to close in early 2014.
We are continuing to add to our capabilities and improve our position for the future. Let me give you a couple of examples. Last week we announced the significant investment to expand our global cloud footprint. We have committed $1.2 billion to double our software centers. On the 40 cloud data centers in 15 countries, IBM will have cloud centers in every major geography and key financial center. Earlier this month, we announced a $1 billion investment in Watson and established a new Watson group. This new unit is dedicated to the development and commercialization of cloud delivered cognitive innovations.
Completing the wrap up of the year, we also improved our ongoing effective tax rate, we benefited from discrete tax items and we returned a significant amount to shareholders. Altogether we continue to position our business for the long term while dealing with some significant business model issues in hardware.
As we look forward to 2014, we will continue our transformation shifting our investments to the growth areas and mixing the higher value. We will acquire key capabilities, we will divest businesses and we will rebalance our workforce as we continue to return value to shareholders.
Our current view all of this is included in our expectation of at least $18 of operating EPS in 2014. That's up 10.5% from $16.28 in 2013. Some of the actions will be early in the year. For example, in the first quarter, we expect the initial closing of the sale of our customer care business and to take the bulk of our workforce rebalancing actions which we are currently working on. We will see the benefits of the first quarter rebalancing action later in the year. As a result, we expect our first quarter EPS to be about 14% of the full year, reflecting the modest gain, workforce rebalancing charge and continued impact from currency.
For these reasons our first quarter skew in 2014 should be lower than our historical skew which has been about 18% of the full year over the last few years. Importantly we expect to grow our free cash flow in 2014 by about $1 billion, that's faster than net income, even after absorbing another significant cash tax headwind and growing capital expenditures. All of this keeps us on track toward 2015 objective of at least $20 of operating EPS. Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I would like to mention a couple of items. First we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information. Second, I would ask you to refrain from multipart questions.
Chris, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays
Thanks a lot. Martin, I really appreciate you talking about the first quarter which looks like it equates to $2.50 versus the consensus of $3.27. I was just hoping if you could confirm that. I think I got the math right, but my question is with regard to a bridge from 2013 to 2014. If I look at 2013, you had about $1.50 or so benefit due to tax rate year-over-year and my calculations are $1.10 in a hit maybe 2014, so considering that it seems like you have to have a significant gain maybe $1 to $2 of gain to get to dollars.
Again, my question is, can you just confirm the $2.50 or so number for the first quarter? Then do you mind bridging us from '13 to '14 and tell me what's missing, because there is a big chunk missing and I think it's the gains from the sale. Thanks a lot.
Martin Schroeter
Okay. Sure. Thanks, Ben, and thanks for the question. I guess, a few things I would say. I think your SKU math is consistent with how we would see it as well, so we will put that aside for now. On the full year, there are I think a number of issues that we should render explicit when we look at going from 2013 to 2014, so first in our 2014 guidance we do assume a gain from the sale of our customer care business which was announced last year we expect that the close. That will close in stages, some in the first, some in the second quarters and that will be in total about $150 million of pretax gain, so that that is in our guidance.
There is not however another substantial gain or gain assumed in our guidance of at least $18 for 2014, but let me talk a little bit about how we see 2014 relative to what we faced in 2013. First, as you saw in our full year results and obviously really clearly in the fourth quarter, we had a substantial year-to-year profit headwind in STG. The STG business on a year-to-year basis for 2013 was down $1.7 billion worth of profit. Of that $750 million was in the fourth quarter, so the fourth, obviously, some of it was mainframe, the cycle and were not at all worried about the cycle as we talked about in the prepared remarks. We are very confident in the secular strength of the mainframe and the cycle, but we do have these small issues and in our p business, our x and our storage business, so on a year-to-year basis $1.7 billion of impact in STG.
Now, within our guidance, we are going to get that profit impact neutralized back towards zero on a year-to-year basis so, we would hold the year-to-year profit that we saw in STG neutral in the year on a comeback to that point at the end again, because there is another important point to be made.
In 2013, we had a pretty substantial currency headwind and we think this could have been as much as $600 million on a pre-tax basis. Now, we have talked in the past some of these things get offset through sourcing decisions and an overall by the flows that we experience within the business, but it could have been as much as $600 million and we still see as we noted in the prepared content we still see a headwind in profit from currency, but it is not at that same level at the current spot rates we don't expect it to be the same level.
Then finally on a year-to-year basis, I think we have one other unique item, which is last year as you know we had a substantial workforce rebalancing charge in the second quarter and that is paying back now, right? We didn't get all of it out, all of the payback in 2013, so there will be some additional benefits from 2014 in that as well. As we noted the call, because we are going to be taking our workforce rebalancing charges earlier than we did last year, it will be in the first quarter, so on a on a full year basis, there won't be any year-to-year impact. We do expect that will be about $1 billion again same as last year, plus or minus $100 million. We are still doing the work, but on a year-to-year basis we would suggest that that's about the same and therefore no year-to-year impact.
Then, obviously, we get the payback within the year. So not only do we get a tailwind from last years but we get everything this year payback. Then in addition to that which benefits the whole business we still have our ongoing workforce productivity initiatives, which are driving productivity across the business, we have our software business going pretty well. We have our GBS business going pretty well, we see GTS profit base in that segment improving. I already talked a little bit about STG getting back to no profit impact on a year-to-year base and then we have our share repurchase program, which will also deliver some EPS on a year-to-year base. So the first answer to your question is, we think your math is where we would put it and then on a year-to-year basis, we feel like we have a pretty good game plan for 2014.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays
Thanks, Martin.
Martin Schroeter
Sorry, Ben, just one more thing. Before we get off STG, our game plan for STG is flat profit year-to-year. That is not our ongoing model for STG. So we will improve and we do expect that we will improve that model position of STG over time. 2015 will see another z cycle, so there will obviously be a little bit of tailwind there but I don't want to leave you with the impression that when we get this to your profit impact, that that's where we are stopping, we are going to get that business back to grow profit. Thanks, Ben.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Ben. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Yes, thank you, and good afternoon, Martin. I just wanted to follow-up on that last question. I really appreciate color. As was mentioned before, tax rate has been a huge, huge benefit for IBM in 2013. I think that your normalized tax rate of 23% earnings would have been up only about 2% year-over-year at about $15.60. Obviously you reported much higher than that. So if I think about your earnings on a normalized tax rate in 2014, they need to go from normalized $15.60 to $18 which is a 15% increase. So I understand that hardware is going to be flat. That made no money this year. But that implies that software and services are going to have grow EPS at 15% year-over-year, which neither did this year. So again if I look at it through that reality check lens, I guess the question is, particularly with a very difficult quarter, at the beginning of the year, how is it realistic that you get to 15% plus EPS growth off a normalized tax rate and can you be explicit about what you expect your actual accrued tax rate to be in 2014? You said normalized is 23%, but it has been dramatically lower than that in three of the last four quarters. So what's your operating assumption for tax rate in 2014?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks, Toni, and good afternoon to you as well. So I guess I would say a few things. Our view of the tax rate is 23%. That's our operating assumption. That's our practical assumption. That's what we think the tax rate is for 2014. Now that does not have discrete items but we don't have a plan, if you will, for discrete items. We have an operating tax rate assumption of 23%, and as you point out therefore we do expect that we will have to refill it, if you will, the net income required to get there. I went through a little bit of the bridge with you, as you pointed out on STG for instance. I guess I would say a few other things.
One, in terms of how we see the year rolling out. As you noted, first quarter, with the charge, we will obviously be down pretty dramatically with the charge in it and that will pay for itself, as I mentioned, through the year. Second quarter, without the charge now, will be up dramatically. So when we finish the first half, with those two elements in, we would see about low double-digit growth in EPS, when we exit the first half.
Now we get to the second half and the second half also has some interesting dynamics. Third quarter, one that we have got, quite frankly, an easier compare and we don't have a lot of noise, if you will, from the tax rate in the third. Certainly not as much as we have in the fourth. So we would see third quarter growth and fourth quarter growth to be combined a high single-digit to get us to be at least $18, but on top of that we know that in the fourth we do have this that we have to get through this discrete tax benefit, if you will, that we got in the fourth. As we get through the fourth, again, we have the rest of last year's actions that that we see continuing to help us. Obviously, the benefit of the actions we will take in March.
Then on a segment-by-segment basis, we do see our way to be guidance of at least $18 even with Software performing at its historic level, so we feel very good about the investments we have made in the Software and its profit growth trajectory as we enter 2014 and we see and feel very good about both, the book of business we have and the backlog run out we have in GBS and they have been delivering double-digit profit growth and we think they are on track.
Now, GTS, we think we get some improved margin as we get through the year and our productivity has a bigger impact on their margin content, and then as you pointed out, STG, we hope to hold neutral. I guess we are planning to hold neutral within this 2014 timeframe.
Again, we do have the share repurchase, so with a very weak first, very, very strong second, we finished the first half about little bit ahead of the run rate we need for the year and then we have to obviously offset these discrete items in the second half and we feel like we have got a good operational plan to do that.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Just to clarify, Martin, for the restructuring expenses that you are expecting in Q1 and any others throughout the year. You don't expect any offsetting gains either concurrent in that quarter or at any other part of the year?
Martin Schroeter
Well, again, just to clarify. In the first quarter, we do have the gain from the sale of our Customer Care business that will be in the first and some in the second as well, but that's all that's assumed in our guidance of at least 18.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thanks. Could we please go to the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from Steven Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steven Milunovich - UBS
Martin, you talked about financial flexibility, could you expand on that a little bit? You have obviously got some cash on the balance sheet, but you do have a 39% debt-to-cap excluding the financing business, which looks to me it seem like there is not a lot of room to go there and you got certainly commitments to investors on dividends and share repurchase.
Some are talking about the need for you to do more M&A given all the technology changes, but whenever I talk to IBM, it seems like you are still very much looking at doing smaller deals that you can really leverage through your global sales force. Do you anticipate any change with M&A and what's the financial flexibility that you refer to?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. I guess, I would say a few things. First, as we have talked about for quite a while on our M&A, our strategy and our approach. We find that the financial returns and the economics of smaller deals, once we have put sort of that core competency, that core capability in place, we find that attaching smaller capabilities to those do drive exactly as you said, we are able to take advantage of those through our global distribution network, our global sales force and we get very good returns on those and we are very pleased with the way we run and the disciplined approach we have around acquisitions and we are going to continue to do exactly that.
It's worked out quite well for us and we will continue to run a disciplined process and we will continue to run a process that looks to acquire content that fits around a set of capabilities that we have and that we want to expand and drive that through our global sales and distribution network to earn returns. That's been the model that's worked quite well for us and we will continue on that.
Now, sometimes those deals are larger, sometimes are smaller. Large deal, we still think that a few billion dollar deal is still a pretty big deal. You still have to get these integrated into the business and that means teams and skills on the ground. We do have capacity to integrate any number of those deals at a single time.
That's really one of the beauties of the skills we have built as we are able to do this five or six or seven or eight times simultaneously, so we are not constrained in our acquisitions by the number of teams we can put on the ground. We can do a series of small deals that will have a terrific set of financials and we have the skills to integrate them and get those to work for us, so that is not at all an issue and we, again, feel really good about our acquisition policy process approach discipline and the results we get out of it.
Now from a financial flexibility standpoint, I think one way to look at it is our debt-to-cap and we are in the range that we are not uncomfortable in at all. Now this even may, and when we look forward, we can operate even a higher debt-to-cap, quite frankly, but the other way that we think about our financial flexibility particularly as we think about it with regard to acquisitions is our EBITDA multiple and how close we can push our uses of cash, if you will, and our debt levels against our EBITDA multiple. Remember, when we are acquiring something we have, with our disciplined process and our ability to get that integrated, we are assuming and we have been right, most of the time we are assuming we are going to get our cash back pretty quickly. Sometimes it takes a little longer. Sometimes it's very fast but those are all contributing to the operational performance. So that debt-to-cap while it's a way to think about our financial flexibility is only one way and quite frankly, I think given the cash generating natures of our acquisition activity, I think that you EBITDA multiple maybe slightly more appropriate because it is a better reflection of how hard you can push your balance sheet and still integrate the content that you know is going to pay off.
So I don't feel as though, at this debt-to-cap or at this EBITDA ratio that we have relative to our debt levels that we feel constrained in any way from doing just about any reasonable size deal and like I said, we do have disciplined process.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Keith. Can we go to the next question please?

The next question comes from Peter Misek with Jefferies. You may ask your question.
Peter Misek - Jefferies
Thank you. Just a question on Watson and some of your other Smarter Planet and analytics offerings. There has been a high-profile or at least the Journal reported recommitment or reinvestment. How should we think of that in the context of the $20 EPS bridge? What percentage of that EPS should we be banking on from these higher growth initiatives? Just to get a sense for what kind of growth rate we should be backing into.
Martin Schroeter
Yes, okay. So, I guess I would make a few points. What we announced last week was the creation of a Watson Group and the Watson Group will have investment of a bit more than $1 billion focused on the development and the research around bringing these cloud delivered cognitive applications and services to the market. Now this is all delivered as a service, right? So it's not like you can't call it and say I want to buy a Watson. This is a service delivered through the cloud. We also announced that we would invest up to $100 million in venture investments to help support that ecosystem as the developers around the IBM Watson developers cloud build out their capabilities.
So we announced those two things. It's a couple of thousand people. It's not a small effort,. It's pretty substantial effort. Now with regard to the 2015 roadmap, I think it's important to note that like a lot of things in IBM, these are long-term investments. We do manage the business for the long-term and while we have been clear that we believe we will achieve at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015 along the way, a lot of what we are doing is paying off down the road past that and I would put Watson into that category.
So the Watson Group is part of, if you will, if you wanted to stick it into the roadmap, the Watson Group is within that overall business analytics content. Now, business analytics, for us, it hit nearly $16 billion. It hit $15.7 billion of revenue in 2013. Now the original time when we first started talking about our 2015 roadmap, we said that would be a $16 billion business. So we have since taken that up. We got there about two years early. We have since taken that up to $20 billion and the Watson Group will certainly be part of that $20 billion of revenue in the 2015 roadmap, but it is not going to be the thing that drives business analytics in that short time period.
This is a much longer term investment and it's consistent with the way we manage the business. We see trends over the longer term. We have to obviously invest in those trends and this is a good example. So the Watson Group will deliver in the new field of cognitive computing. It does it through the cloud because it's going to be as a service kind of offering and we think building out this ecosystem with the right amount of investment is the right thing to do now, even though it's not going to be a big part of the 2015 roadmap.
Peter Misek - Jefferies
The Business Analytics bridge remains the same? $20 billion is what we expect by 2015. I guess that was the more specific question as it's related to 2015?
Martin Schroeter
Yes. That's correct.

Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask your question.
Jim Suva - Citi
Thank you very much. Martin, The signing that you had 17.5 this quarter. When we look at the full year rolls up to about 11% year-over-year which is very impressive. Can you just help us understand little bit about the last few quarters have been down year-over-year, so the first half of the year is very strong on your signings then they were soft in second half of the year.
As that 11% rolls forward next year, should we look to start to see some healthy growth or is there a little bit of margin headwind from it, or how should we think about especially how the first half being so positive year-over-year and second half is slowing. I assume a lot of it has to do with the BRIC or growth countries, but maybe you can shed some light? Thank you.
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Jim. Thanks for the question. I think there are a couple of points to made here. First, signings, as you know and you could hear it within the data you are quoting, signings can be volatile in any given quarter and backlog is another element that we have been sharing because that signings content all goes into a backlog and then it drives, obviously, the future revenue opportunity and I am going to come back to that in a second because your question, I think, about the future is more going to be around the backlog we see as opposed to maybe the signings in any given quarter.
Now, backlog we finished up 5% year-to-year and full year Services signings were pretty strong growth on a constant currency basis, in fact, it's about the best growth we have seen in the past five years.
Now in the fourth quarter, the signings were up 1% at constant currency versus the third and maybe this is to your point of how volatile they are. The third was down four, so we went from down four to up one. The dynamic we saw in going from third to fourth was interesting in that in the third our long-term signings were down double-digit, while in the fourth they swapped to up double digits, so very good performance in the longer-term, more transformational kind of content in the fourth and then in the shorter-term contracts they were up single-digit in the third and they moved to down double-digit in the fourth.
Some of that is because we are mixing our signings. We are mixing our delivery to higher value managed services like business continuity and security and cloud, so you are exactly right, signings is obviously volatile. There is a bit of a shift that we see in our bookings in third going to fourth, again, driven by very good acceptance and pretty strong growth in our longer term, more transformative kind of content outsourcing and those tend to be bigger deals, in fact our larger, deals say greater than $100 million.
For the full year, we are up 40% versus the prior year, so we are seeing very good growth in those bigger deals. Now, when we talk about backlog, again backlog we finished the year up 5% at constant currency. There are a couple of things to note about, I think, that are worth note about backlog.
First, we are going to close on the sale of our customer care business and that's going to have an impact to the backlog. Though while the revenue from the backlog that we see coming out of the total would drive us to a positive growth rate the losses, the backlog and the loss of the revenue out of that customer care business is going to drive it to a small negative and we are obviously prepared for that. We know. We have that covered in our guidance for the year, but we are going to see an impact from the sale of that business within that specific element that you mentioned which is revenue coming out of the backlog.
Now the whole year isn't driven out of the backlog. 70% of our revenue in any given year might be out of the backlog, but the other 30% is coming from our in-year or in-quarter shorter term signings and we have seen volatility there as well. Our base business outside of the backlog struggled a bit in the fourth, we saw a single-digit decline out of that, so we will see growth out of the backlog on an adjusted basis, if you will, without the customer care business and then the rest of the growth will have to come from our base business.
Now, within that base business, we do have things like our cloud offering, and cloud grew very, very well. While it doesn't show up in the backlog necessarily, it does provide growth within that other 30%.
Patricia Murphy

The next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.
Scott Craig - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. If I can get one clarification in there. The workforce rebalancing in the first quarter, is that included as an expense in the $18?
Then my second question is around the cash flow. You did a great job of providing the bridge to kind of get to the $18 in 2014. Can you maybe go into a little more detail on some of the free cash flow pushes and pulls for 2014? Thanks.
Martin Schroeter
Sure, absolutely. So first, just for clarification, our at least $18 of guidance is all-in. So it has workforce rebalancing charges in it. It has the small gain that we expect. It's all-in, of at least $18, all-in basis and like the roadmap, it's an all-in roadmap of at least $20. So if we were to just hit the bottom end of our current guidance of at least $18, we would have another $2 to go, to finish out that roadmap. So yes, it's on an all-in basis.
On cash flow. So we had a difficult cash flow year in 2013. As you heard in the prepared remarks, we were down year-to-year, a bit over $3 billion. If we were to kind of split up the attribution for that, as we did on the call, operational performance, as I mentioned we lost $1.7 billion of profit year-to-year just in the STG business which had a profound impact on our cash. So operational challenges; we had a cash tax headwind in 2013 and then we had a slightly less efficient balance sheet working capital, if you will, in 2013 as well which drove the year-to-year decline in 2013.
Now as we go to 2014, we said we will grow free cash flow by about $1 billion, a little bit faster than net income, but by about $1 billion. Within that $1 billion, we still have a cash tax headwind of about $2 billion this year. So a larger cash tax headwind but I want to talk about cash, and the bridge, by the way, comes from improved operational performance within the business and we will improve our working capital position, if you will. That will drive the year-to-year improvement in 2013 to 2014.
But I would like to also spend a minute on free cash flow from a model perspective. From a model perspective we finished last year, if I were to look at free cash flow on a ratio basis, say, to net income on a free cash flow realization basis, we finished the year in the low-90s on a realization basis. As I mentioned, this $1 billion would, and a little bit faster than net income, so obviously the math says we will improve that a little bit in 2014. But we would still be, we think, in the low-90s, even in 2014. Then in 2015 we would see another improvement when cash tax isn't as big a headwind and we would see an improvement back to the mid-90 level.
Now, that mid-90 level, relative to what we have seen in the past on a realization basis, is below where we have been when it was north of 100%, right? We ran the free cash flow realization north of 100% for many years and a big chunk of this is the difference between the cash tax and the book tax. Now when we go forward on a model basis, we are very comfortable that in the mid-90s, our model holds over the long-term and by model, I mean, our model of being able to continue to invest to either build or acquire capabilities that we need to continue to pay the dividend, if I oversimplify all this in terms of uses of cash; invest to grow; pay the dividend; and then return excess cash, if you will, to shareholders.
Now in the past, when we were north of 100% on a realization basis, that share repurchase element could drive five, six, seven points of EPS growth year-to-year. That's not what our model would say we need and on a model basis if we were to be in that mid-90s, we would still deliver three to four points of EPS growth, just from the share repurchase. So on free cash flow, again, I know you asked a 2014 question, but 2014 we will grow again and we will improve that realization but even when we look out longer term on a model basis, we are comfortable that in the mid-90s, which we will get back to by 2015 in the mid-90s, the model and a simplified view, the model, from a uses perspective the model will hold.

The next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Thanks. Good afternoon. Coming into the fourth quarter, you expected better sales execution in China, which doesn't appear to have come through. Can you just talk about what you have learned over the past three months around the drivers of weakness in China and what you now think it takes and what the right timeline is to return to growth?
Martin Schroeter
Sure. Thanks, Katie, and good afternoon. I will just go through a couple of data points here. As you saw, we did degrade to minus 3 on a constant currency basis in the fourth, from minus 2 in the third on a global basis. That one point degradation, when you look at the majors was really centered in the z cycle and centered in the U.S., so, I will leave that off to the side because, again, we are comfortable with the z cycle and where we are.
When we look in GMU, which was the nature of your question, we did see that same one point degradation and it is not what we wanted to get done. Now, we continue to struggle in Hardware, we were still down double-digits in hardware, a little better sequentially from third to fourth, but still down double-digits.
Services across the growth market areas went from a small positive to a small negative in GTS. GBS went from low single-digit growth to high single-digit growth, so they actually did quite well, but it's a smaller part of the business so it doesn't have as profound an impact on the overall, so when we looked at third quarter to fourth quarter, China is still an issue.
Now, let's recognize that China is going through a very significant economic set of reform, so in March 2013, history that everyone knows, but on March of 2013 a new leadership team in November that they announced, some pretty significant structural changes and we referred to those in the last call and we are waiting to see what they were and they looked, in our opinion, they looked quite significant. Now, many of those changes will affect the state-owned enterprises and those state-owned enterprises are quite frankly some of our largest accounts.
To go from that view of the world down to what did we learn, well, we actually always knew this, but we have to continue to make progress. We are centered pretty heavily in state-owned enterprises, so it has a pretty profound impact on our business when they slow their purchasing.
From an execution standpoint, we know we have to spread more into other elements of the buying patterns that we see in China and we will get that done, but it's not surprising I guess to us given our concentration in state-owned enterprises that it's having an impact on us.
In many ways, yes, we are in state-owned enterprises, but it's exactly where we want to be. When you think about building an infrastructure for a country, if you will, the IBM platform is critical to do that, so of course we want heavy reliance or to be in those accounts. When they slow down then we also see an impact, so from an execution standpoint, we recognize that we have to widen, if you will, our client.
On the state-owned enterprises and others, while they have slowed, we don't think that this opportunity is gone away if you will. There is still opportunity. In fact, our interpretation of some of the structural changes they announced suggests that we will have expanded opportunities, particularly in regional banking and some privately owned enterprises.
As we expand our footprint in China, we do still see good long-term opportunity. In fact, we continue to invest in China to try to capture that opportunity, but it will take some time to come back. It's not going to rebound immediately. Now, the other thing, just math, we do get easier compares in the first and the second and the third quarter obviously, so that provides a bit of a tailwind.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Could you grow in China by the fourth quarter of this year? Will it take longer than that?
Martin Schroeter
It's hard to tell. China is hard to tell, because I don't have a good sense of how those reforms work their way through the system and the decision-making that goes all around it. This is a, as I am sure you will appreciate it, pretty complex environment and it's difficult to gauge exactly what's going to happen on a roll-out basis.
Now, if we look at the growth markets in total, we are comfortable that we are on a trajectory to growth. We will be on a trajectory to growth as we exit 2014 and we are comfortable that we get back to mid-single digits across the growth market regions by the end of the year but again, second half statement more than an immediate statement.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Thank you very much.
Patricia Murphy
Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan
Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, Martin. I appreciate the color today. I just want to come back to the tax rate, though. If we kind of adjust 2013 and 2014 for the tax rate, it really implies your business has to improve substantially moving through 2014. With China still kind of in this holding pattern, and your hardware still struggling, the high-end support seems to be a bit more of a secular challenge or technology challenge. What should investors think about as the top three pivot points that you are really looking to, to really have this confidence that you can reiterate both the $18 EPS target as well as the $20 target for 2015 notwithstanding the tax rate?
Martin Schroeter
Right, so I guess, we did obviously get a substantial tax benefit in the fourth, but it's not that tax rate, I think it's really the underlying business that is what we are, obviously, focused on improving and again, as I said earlier, that hardware impact has been dramatic in all of 2013. The currency impact has been dramatic in 2013. So when we look at the other elements of our business, including in software, we will grow software very consistently with what we grew in prior years and that assumption is obviously within the at least $18, but it also is an assumption that we feel very comfortable with to get to the guidance for 2014.
On services, we do see good momentum in GBS. We finished the second half of the year with double-digit profit growth in GBS. In GTS, based on the contracts we have and the time that those contracts have been in place and the productivity therefore that we believe we can drive out of services, we see services back at a model level of growth. Again, share repurchase and the overall enterprise productivity initiatives we expect that at least $18 is right in line with what we should be able to deliver.
The other element of this is, we don't have a year-to-year impact from our restructuring in 2014. It was $1 billion last year. It will be about $1 billion again this year. So we eliminate that year-to-year and without the year-to-year impact from hardware that allows that software and that services profit growth to show up in the bottom line. So without the hardware profit growth impact, less of an impact from currency as we stated, services performing at model, if you will, and software at its historical growth rate along with EPS, we will refill that tax impact and get back to $23, but importantly we are comfortable with the at least $18.
Patricia Murphy
Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.
Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald
Yes. Hi, Martin. Just a clarification. In the March quarter, you expect $1 billion restructuring charge from rebalancing activities and $150 gain from the sale of assets. Is that correct?
Patricia Murphy
Yes. I think the $150 is--
Martin Schroeter
The $150, it will close over the first half.
Patricia Murphy
Right.
Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald
Okay.
Martin Schroeter
The $150 closes. It's not all in the first quarter.
Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald
Because I think when you are saying 14% of the year's EPS, that the $18 is in the first quarter, this is really a number that includes a massive restructuring charge that is normally allocated over a years' time. So my question is why don't we back out when we restructure restructuring charge, which is non-operating and back out gains when we have gains, which are not operating. I think investors would like that because it gives them a view in the operating performance of IBM?
Martin Schroeter
Well, I guess I would say a few things. So first, just to make sure you are clear. The first quarter we would expect a substantial charge, right, about same as last year, plus or minus $100 million, and we have the gain, but not all 150s some of it.
The roadmap we have laid out, the roadmap is a way for us to allocate capital and it's a way for us to describe to investor how we shift the portfolio that shift of the portfolio includes acquisitions includes divestitures, it includes our rebalancing the workforce and all of that translates to an EPS at the end. That EPS is reflective of all those activities. It's got the workforce rebalancing, it's got the gains if there are any, it has got the shift of investment, the roadmap is in an all-in basis, if you will, and our guidance is also on an all-in basis.
I think, the right way to look at our business is to keep it on the basis in which we have described our longer term performance, not only two years away from the end of the roadmap now, but our longer term performance is one where as we shift the value, we acquire, we divest and it is important I think to look at the totality of that earnings power and that's the way and again that why we built our roadmap the way we built the guidance.
Patricia Murphy
Okay.
Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald
Okay. If there was a gain later in the year, that would be incremental to the 18, but it is not currently in your guidance, outside of the 150?
Martin Schroeter
As I said the only gain we have is this first half, it is $150 million gain. That's what we have in our guidance.
Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald
Right. Thank you.
Patricia Murphy
Can we please take one more question?
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you. Hi, Martin. I was wondering if we could just go back to the Services numbers just for a minute, and my recollection from the third quarter call was that there was an expectation is that sequentially the year-over-year growth rates would improve for both, GBS and GTS.
Can you help us understand what items maybe impacting the Services growth other than the GMUs and how we should think about the trajectory of that business in 2014, particularly given the headwind to backlog from the sale of the customer care business?
Martin Schroeter
Sure, David. You know, GBS grew 4% which was in line with its prior quarter, and we think even within that we took share, within that GBS content, we continue to move capability toward our Digital Front Office offerings and those have been very successful and so what's driving the growth in GBS, it's both, our success in the Digital Front Office and the momentum coming from business we have booked into the backlog in prior quarters and we see that continuing on the GBS side into 2014.
In GTS, the growth markets were an impact in GTS in the fourth. Now, we think when we look at that business and its trajectory changed from two-fourth from the third, we do see a continued investment required in some of our growth market clients, which is driving some of that content and we have signed some big contracts during the year. We see us in a stage of early stage of some contracts where the productivity quite frankly as you would expect, is not as high, so as we get into 2014, and those contracts specifically mature, and the investments we have made in some of those GMU clients payoff, we do see a bit of a tailwind.
Now, on the revenue side in GTS, as you pointed out, we do see growth in the backlog, but we are going to lose the impact of the customer care business, which we think, again, knocks the revenue side of that down to a small negative.
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thanks, David. I want to thank you all for your questions and now I am going to turn it back to the operator.

Mark Loughridge
In the third quarter, we reported $23.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross and net operating margins and increased operating earnings per share by 10% to $3.99. For the year, we’re maintaining our full year 2013 expectation for operating EPS of at least $16.25 on an all in basis, or $16.90 excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge.
Looking at the results by business, our total services business returned to modest revenue growth at constant currency, led by 5% growth in GBS. Our backlog was up 2% or 6% at constant currency with another strong performance from GBS.
Software delivered mid-single digit growth at constant currency in key branded middleware. In hardware, growth in System z mainframe was more than offset by declines in Power Systems apps and storage. Two-thirds of the overall hardware decline was driven by the growth market.
Across IBM we delivered strong performance in our growth initiatives, that addressed key market trends, smarter planet, business analytics and cloud, leveraging both organic investments and acquisitions. Our Smarter Planet solutions are up more than 20% through September and Business Analytics is up 8% year-to-date.
In cloud, we closed the acquisition of SoftLayer in July which significantly improves our capabilities in public and hybrid cloud. For the first time we delivered more than a $1 billion of cloud revenue in a quarter of which $460 million is delivered as a cloud service. To the first three quarters our cloud revenue was up more than 70% year-to-year.
From a geographic perspective our challenge this quarter was in growth markets, where revenue was down 9% or 5% at constant currency. Our performance in growth markets has historically outpaced major markets by 8 to 10 points. But this quarter for the first time the growth markets trailed the majors.
I will get into this specifics and action later in the call. For the quarter, IBM’s revenue was down 4% or down about 1.5% at constant currency. So the currency impact to revenue was about 2.5 points. Currency also impacted our profit performance as we’ve discussed in the past a weakening Yen drops largely to the bottom line. This quarter we improved gross and net margins. Our operating gross margin expanded by one point driven by an improvement in services margins and the relative strength of software and mainframe.
The net margin improvement also reflects savings from the second quarter workforce rebalancing activity, tough minded spending actions at a better tax rate. There are three drivers of the lower tax rate. First, discrete benefits associated with recent foreign tax audits. Second, a reduction in the ongoing effective tax rate which we now expect to be in the range of 23% for the year and through 2014.
And third, last year’s tax included a higher rate on the gain from the divestiture of our RSS business. Bottom line we delivered operating EPS of $3.99 which was up 10% year-to-year. Now I will get into the third quarter details starting with revenue by geography. Where I’ll discuss the results on a constant currency basis, I will start with a few comments by major geography and then provide a perspective on the major versus growth markets.
Americas revenue was flat year-to-year, which is up three point improvement from last quarter’s rate; the improvement came equally from the U.S. and Canada and once again, we had strong performance in Latin America.
Our EMEA revenue was down 2%, fairly consistent with last quarter. Western Europe in particular showed some stability while Eastern Europe led by Russia had double-digit declines.
In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 4%; within that, Japan’s revenue was up 5% with good performance across hardware, software, and services. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth with good execution by the team in Japan. Consequently the AP decline was driven by the growth market countries.
So now let me comment on the major markets versus growth markets globally. Major markets year-to-year performance improved by almost two points from last quarter, in fact, this is the best major market performance since the first quarter of 2012.
Our challenge this quarter was in the growth markets, which were down 5%. Though we continue to gain share and deliver strong growth in Latin America as well as Middle East and Africa, we fell short of our objectives and the market in other regions.
Our performance at growth markets was driven about half by execution and half by a pause as China moves to the process to develop its new economic plans. China was down 22%. We experienced a slowdown in demand across the board, but most significantly in hardware, which was down about 40% and which makes up about 40% of our business in China.
While we had some execution problems during the third quarter, we were impacted by the process surrounding China’s development of a broad based economic reform plan, which will be available mid November. In the mean time, demand from state-owned enterprises and the public sector has slowed significantly as decision-making and procurement cycles lengthened. We believe the changes will take time to implement and do not expect demand in China to pick up until after the first quarter of next year.
Now let me put this in context. The hardware performance in China accounted for all five points of the constant currency decline in the growth markets and for 1.2 of the 1.6 points of constant currency decline for all of IBM. Regarding execution in the growth markets we understand the issues and have already taken management actions to improve performance. Looking forward, we have confidence that we can get this back on track. We expect a change in trajectory starting in the fourth quarter and we’ll be back to growth early in 2014.
Turning now to IBM’s revenue by segment; in GBS we improved our year-to-year constant currency growth rate to 5% led by consulting and systems integration. Our GTS performance is a modest improvement from last quarter’s rate, reflecting the addition of SoftLayer to our portfolio. Our software revenue grew 2% at constant currency led by key branded middleware at 4%. Performance was stronger in the infrastructure layer including solution for data management, application server, security, mobile and rational development tools.
As I said earlier, in Systems and Technology the deceleration in our performance was primarily driven by the growth markets. In Global Financing, we had growth in both financing revenue, which is driven by client asset growth as well as new sales. The return on equity in our financing business was 38% this quarter.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 1 point, driven by a combination of margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix. Now let’s take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was flat year-to-year, acquisitions over the last 12 months drove two points of expense growth. Currency contributed 1 point of decline driven by translation. So consequently our base expense was better by two points.
Now I’ll comment on a few items that had year-to-year impacts. Last year we had a significant charge for workforce rebalancing activity. We also had a significant gain from the sale of our retail store solutions business. So looking at the year-to-year dynamics and SG&A workforce rebalancing is down nearly $400 million year-to-year and another income and expense divestiture gains are down over $450 million.
Next parts of our business didn’t perform as expected and as you know IBM has a pay per performance culture. Accordingly performance related compensation across both cost and expense was down about $175 million year-to-year.
Finally, I want to comment on the impact of currency this quarter. In the third quarter the hedge activity was fairly neutral in the period though on a year-to-year basis hedging gains were down about $80 million was about three quarters in expense in the balancing costs. While there have been a number of currency movements year-to-year, we have been significantly impacted by the depreciation of the Yen, because our business in Japan is dominated by local services without cross border cash flows to hedge the impact falls largely to the bottom line. The year-to-year profit impact was more significant than the third quarter, and would continue at current spot rates through the first quarter of next year.
Now let’s turn to the segments starting with services. This quarter the two services segments generated $14 billion in revenue, declining 3% as reported but a constant currency return to growth of 1%. Pre-tax profit was up 17% and pre-tax margin expanded by 3.3 points. Total backlog was a $141 billion, up 2% of spot rates and up 6% at constant currency. Backlog again grew across both the transactional and outsourcing businesses.
Turing to the two segments; Global Technology Services revenue was $9.5 billion, down 4% or down 1% at constant currency. This represents a 1 point improvement over the last quarter year-to-year performance. In outsourcing we continue to see decline in revenue from sales into existing base accounts and from the structural work we did previously on low margin contracts. Our Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 2% at constant currency and grew in both major and growth markets.
GTS delivered 12% pre-tax profit growth in the quarter and expanded pre-tax margins by 2.8 points. Margin expansion was driven by lower year-to-year workforce rebalancing charges and some savings from second quarter rebalancing action along with tough minded spend actions and continued efficiency improvements.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue of $4.6 billion was flat as reported and of 5% at constant currency, that’s up from 2% last quarter. With this performance GBS gained share. From a geographic perspective there is growth across the portfolio led by North America and Japan. Europe returned to growth for the first time since the beginning of 2012.
Looking at the GBS business by our two major categories, we had good results across the portfolio. Within the digital front-office, we delivered double-digit growth across the initiatives, Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud, and within our back office solutions that we call the Globally Integrated Enterprise. We again grew in implementation services that support the traditional packaged applications.
Turning to profit, GBS grew 26% year-to-year and PTI margin expanded by 4.4 points. The year-to-year profit drivers included lower year-to-year workforce rebalancing charges, savings from second quarter rebalancing and tough-minded spend actions.
So to wrap up Services, we returned to revenue growth this quarter, our growth initiatives continue to perform, we grew pre-tax profit and expanded profit margins and we’re entering the next quarter with solid backlog growth of 6% at constant currency.
Software revenue of $5.8 billion was up 1% or 2% at constant currency. Segment pre-tax income of $2.4 billion was up 2%. Our strategic key branded middleware revenue grew 3% or 4% at constant currency and held share.
I’ll take you through the drivers by brand. WebSphere was up 1% at constant currency. Within WebSphere we saw strength in mobile and good performance in Application Server. Information management software grew 3% at constant currency. Our distributed database had a good quarter with double-digit growth. Tivoli software was up 3% at constant currency, driven by storage growth in our portfolio of security solutions.
Our security business delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. The acquisition of Trusteer in the third quarter extends our data security capabilities further into cloud and mobile environment. Rational grew 14% at constant currency. Rational’s DevOps solution leverages IBM’s cloud capabilities for the rapid and interim deployment of software. Social Workforce Solutions grew 15%, driven by Kenexa, which provides cloud-based recruiting and talent management.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we have a strong pipeline in software. Consequently we expect improvements in software revenue growth and double-digit growth in profit.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.2 billion was down 17%. The growth markets performance drove two-thirds of the revenue decline, about half of which was China. This impacted each of the hardware brands. System z grew 7% at constant currency with double-digit growth in the major markets. MIPS were up 56%, driven again by specialty engines, which were up more than 90%.
During the quarter we successfully launched the new z Enterprise midrange server with over 50% more capacity than its predecessor. Power revenue was down 37% at constant currency. High-performance computing accounted for 10 points of the decline. To improve future performance we’re continuing to invest to expand our power platform to go after the Linux opportunity, which is now larger than UNIX and growing more rapidly.
System x was down 16% at constant currency. Storage hardware revenue was down 10% at constant currency. The decline was driven by the growth market. In the major market storage revenue was up. Our storage products again delivered double-digit growth and we also continued to grow our flash solution. These were offset by declines in our legacy OEM midrange offerings and softness in the high-end.
Pure Systems continued to gain momentum. In the major markets we grew more than 30% sequentially. Globally we shipped over 2,000 systems in the third quarter with over 8,000 total shipments since announcement.
Moving on to the cash flow analysis, we discussed our free cash flow performance excluding the change in Global Financing receivables. We do this because we consider the financing receivables as an investment to generate return, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency.
As I mentioned earlier, our Global Financing business is delivering a terrific return on equity. This quarter we generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow, down $900 million year-to-year. There was three key drivers of the year-to-year decline. Higher workforce rebalancing payments for the second quarter program, changes in sales cycle working capital and our operational performance. For the first three quarters of the year we generated $6.6 billion, which is down $2 billion year-to-year. Looking at the uses of our cash, through September we spend $2.6 billion to acquire seven companies including four in the third quarter, the largest of which was SoftLayer.
We’ve returned just over $11 billion to shareholders this year. We paid out $3 billion in dividends and spend over $8 billion and grow share repurchase to buyback almost 40 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had $5.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $10.2 billion. Total debt was $36.2 billion of which $25.8 billion was in support of a financing business, which is leveraged just over 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $10.4 billion, effectively flat year-to-year and our non-financing debt to cap was 39%. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility with a strong balance sheet to support our business objectives.
When you look at the year-to-year drivers of our operating EPS performance the 4% decline in revenue at constant margin impacted profit growth by $0.15 per share. Margin expansion was the largest contributor to our growth. Within that we had positive contribution from gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, mitigated by a higher E to R [ph]. Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed the balance at a level fairly consistent with last quarter.
To wrap up, in the third quarter the combination of continued momentum in key growth areas, better business mix, yield from productivity initiatives, reductions in spending and compensation, discrete tax benefits and effective use of cash, all enabled us to deliver 10% operating EPS growth. Clearly we need to improve performance predominantly in the growth market and keep in mind that we’re dealing with a couple of substantial headwinds. We observe a significant impact from currency in these results and affected by the pause during the development of China’s new economic plans.
As far as the growth markets are concerned, we will be dealing with the China impact for another couple of quarters, more broadly in growth markets. We’re taking management actions to improve execution and are confident we can get it back on track and improve our performance starting the fourth quarter, driving to mid single-digit performance in growth markets in 2014.
Looking to the future, we expect continued strong performance in our growth initiatives, Smarter Planet, business analytics and cloud. These not only address key market trends, but they drive a higher mix of software and consequently a higher margin. We’ll continue our transformation over the long-term to a higher margin annuity base and even stronger business profile. And so with this improved operational performance, continued momentum in our growth initiatives and the flexibility in the financial model we’re maintaining our view of at least $16.25 of operating EPS in 2013 and remain confident in our ability to achieve at least $20 in 2015.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.

Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions.

Operator
Thank you. At this time, we’d like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Steve with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steven M. Milunovich – UBS Securities LLC
…pipeline and maybe mid-single digit revenue growth and return to growth and services…
Patricia Murphy
Sorry, Steve. Steve, can you start with the beginning. We missed the beginning of your question.
Steven M. Milunovich – UBS Securities LLC
Can you hear me?
Patricia Murphy
Now we can, yes.
Steven M. Milunovich – UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Sorry about that. Coming into the quarter, Mark, you talked about mid-single digit revenue growth in software and so much stronger services growth than you posted. So even aside from the hardware issues in China, it seems like things are a bit weaker. What you attribute that to, is it just demand as we’re hearing at a lot of enterprise companies. How much of this execution because in the third quarter last year you had some software execution problems, you’re talking about some growth market execution problems. I guess how much is under your control, how much isn’t?
Mark Loughridge
Okay. Well, let me answer your question in stages just as you asked us. So let’s start with software. I agree we did not have the software quarter we’re looking for. If you look historically both for the IBM corporation and certainly for the software business third quarters tend to be difficult for us. Fourth quarters tend to be strong. So I would expect based on all of the work we’ve done to look at their pipeline going into the fourth that we would maintain that relative characteristic and see our key branded middleware with growth rates in kind of mid-single digits and double-digit profitability in the fourth quarter.
If you look at the characteristics, once we get to the end of the year obviously quarters close out December 31. So there’s an off lot energy in the sales organization as we close the year, but we have typically had the same pattern as you have seen if you go back to the last number of years with a difficult third followed by a stronger fourth quarter and I think that has a lot to do with our overall software performance.
Now when you go to the services organization, however, I would say that first of all with backlog up 6%, that’s pretty good performance. And if you look at the GTS business, I mean GTS did improve revenue albeit on a more marginal base, but the GTS are long extended contract that is kind of the battleship, the turn here.
On the other hand, GBS at 5%, I think that’s pretty good. And if we look back on the GBS profile over the last four quarters, they have taken that business from minus two to a plus five and as we look at their strength as they have built that backlog, we see close at a plus seven as we go into the fourth quarter and in both cases returning services, as we have said, to grow in the third quarter and both third and fourth generating double-digit profitability.
So I do think we saw the kind of cadenced improvement on our services business. I think on the software side, we wrestled with this kind of typically weaker third followed by a, what we are looking to be a stronger fourth.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question, please.

The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni M. Sacconaghi – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Yes, thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the first question bit more broadly. I understand some of the specific issues this quarter around China, but if we kind of step back and think about what’s been happening with IBM. Over a longer period recently you’ve had six straight quarters were revenue growth has been negative. You’ve missed consensus revenue expectations for seven straight quarters.
If it weren’t for a huge tax benefit this quarter, it would have been a very significant EPS miss, which has occurred to IBM in the last couple of quarters and hadn’t occurred in seven or eight years. So if we step back beyond the current quarter, we see a pattern of financial performance that is way out of whack with your historical model, lower revenue growth and operating profit growth that is dramatically lower but it’s been buttress by tax rate and not including workforce rebalancing charge.
So my simple question is what’s changed in the last six or seven quarters? Has there been a – I mean, less of a focus on execution that had to deal with the change in leadership at the top? Are you seeing new secular forces? I think it’s very easy to explain away a given quarter, but six, seven, eight quarters in a row begins to make a trend. And so perhaps you can try and address what you think is happening more broadly and whether we should be thinking about a financial model that is more like 0% revenue growth and something less than double digit earnings growth on a sustained basis.
Mark Loughridge
Okay, Toni, it’s always a very good question. Let me answer your question by giving you a framework for how I would look at that in 2013, then moving into 2014 to give a framework for that dynamics and how we intend to deal with them.
So, first of all to state the obvious, I mean we never said that the roadmap aggression would be the straight line and we are accessing our progress on a year-to-year basis. First is the 16, 25 at least for the year. I will say that to me and I think we have stated this repeatedly, the tax and shares are operational cadence for us. But I do not debate your point that we have had some very discrete difficulties as we’re down through the quarters which I want to address now.
Now I would say broadly that plus or minus in software and services, a portion of our business has been marching down the field and kind of the structure that we’re looking for at, we talked a little bit earlier, GBS has made very good progress. We got backlog up, at 6% of constant currency we did get some lift in our GTS business both generating profitability. So I don’t think that the services business have shown a substantially different vector and in fact are improving as we go forward.
Software, I agree with the point, difficult third quarter. I got to say, in that software organization just like for the broader IBM we tend to have more difficulty in third quarters and stronger fourth quarters. But to be specific to your question, what’s changed? We had two major headwinds that really hit us hard this year.
So on a year-to-date basis, we had a $1 billion of year-to-date decline in profitability from our hardware business. Now that is quite substantial, that is quite substantial as a headwind and on top of that $1 billion is a profit decline in our hardware business. We had a $500 million year-to-year impact from currency. Now that’s clearly the theoretical upper limit. But given the fact that, the bulk of an impact is from the movement of un-hedged currencies like the impact from the yen that presented us with a pretty stiff challenge.
So in a way if you look at the bottom line performance in 2013, the elements of financial flexibility whether that be tax, both the discrete items that we recognized in the third quarter or the improvement of the rate, which extends to 2014 or the benefit of share repurchase has helped along with the operational performance that we did see from software and services help mitigate, absorb and partially offset this very strong headwind we had in the hardware business and in the currency.
Now if you look at currency, currency at current spot rate should write itself as we go into the second quarter of next year. Now obviously we’ll all be tracking that overtime. That’s what the math would say. So that leaves us with the impact from hardware. So if you look at the hardware content, the point we’re making in the third quarter performance that in that hardware base of business the kind of nexus of erosion that we had was really in China.
Now, China broadly in a year accounts for about 5% of IBM and about 40% of that business is hardware, but the hardware business across those elements of the product line accepting z series performance, it was down substantially. We were talking 40%, 50%, enormous reductions on a year-to-year basis in a geography we were intended to see growth rates. You can see that in compare we had for China last year, up 19%, so up 19% last year, driven heavily by really strong performance in hardware base, but it’s year down.
And you got to look at that and say, what significantly accounts for that. And I would say, quite honestly, if you look at the elements in China and we have worked with the team in China that simply has been a substantial impact as the process surrounding China’s development of broad based economic reform plan takes shape. And that is going to be announced and available, we think in November and probably it will take some time to implement. So I think we are looking at a couple of quarters, but once that economic plan is announced, adds clarity to market, we should see I think and fairly within our team, a recovery in the demand pattern for state-owned enterprise public sector.
Now if you look at the profile that we would be counting on that generating next year, we’d be looking for the growth markets with that new economic plan in China to recover and generate something in mid single digits. And in fact if you took that hardware impact that we saw in China, I mean frankly that hardware impact in China is all of the decline in our growth markets unit.
So I think that’s a rationale set of objective and with that performance in our growth markets unit next year, again back to mid single digits if we get the better definition on the economic plan in China and improved performance, for us the other regions in GMU that too should help us suspend the erosion that we’re seeing in our hardware business.
On a year-to-year basis, I frankly think we have set a pretty low bar to establish our financial structure and our operations objectives for those business units, expecting only flat year-to-year profitability which clearly this year is a loss now, when we think we could even do things better than that. But on a flat basis for the STG business, in 2014 compared to 2013 with our new P series, power aid product set to address the Linux opportunity which you know is larger than UNIX opportunity in growing, better growth and volume behind our PureFlex business which is picking up steam and broader exposure to our flash memory contents in storage, that should help us right size it even though in the mainframe set of the house, we’ll be driving more towards the microcode upgrade part of the z series cycle.
All of that fairly complemented in 2014 by the benefit on an year-to-year basis of the workforce for balancing yield that we’ve already taken which in 2014 will be more than enough to offset the year-to-year challenge from the tax discrete items that we saw this year, complemented additionally by the financial flexibility that we have to grow our share repurchase.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Toni, let’s go to the next question.
Operator
The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask you question.
Bill C. Shope – Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay, great. Thanks. On the growth market challenges, I think you’ve been very clear on the macro drivers in the government issues within China. But by looking at the execution component you mentioned, as we think about the normalization process here, could you give us some more granularity on exactly what the execution issues are. And I think when we look at this longer-term given how sharp some of the downturn are, how sharp some of the shortfalls are in this segment for you. What gives you confidence that the problems in Asia-Pac and the growth market specifically aren’t secular in nature for IBM?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, I think, let me give this framework for the explanation. First of all, if you look at the performance that we saw this quarter in growth markets, revenue at constant currency down 5% compared to the IT growth rate and growth markets are plus 5. We’ve had about 10 point gap there. So we did very kind of simple back of the envelope analysis on that to distinguish what was macro and what was execution and we said, well if we took that big STG erosion that we saw in China that we would conclude is highly related to the process of developing the Chinese economic policy. If we snap that out, the growth markets would have been flat. And so to us that sounds like about 5 of that 10 point gap to the industry are coming from a macro environment issue. The other five we think it’s pure execution.
Now I would argue that you’re seeing our ability to put leadership teams on the ground to turn our performance in geographic. Now the hallmark in that was that for us is Japan. Japan has really turned around in a very big way under the leadership of Martin Jetter and his team got engaged by broadly and we’ve seen that perform quarter after quarter with that leadership capability.
So in the growth market organization the leadership team that established that to begin with and drove that organization is now back in the cockpit led by Bruno Di Leo and his leadership team. They know how to get this done. They helped build this to begin with. So I think that’s an explanation on the macro environment impact that we saw that we would say accounted for about half that differential to the industry as well as the leadership differential and the action that IBM has taken to address those on the execution element.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Bill. Can we go to the next question, please.

The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
David M. Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you. I wondered if you can just turn to free cash flow for me Mark. Is the free cash flow year-to-date in your view a good proxy for the 2013 decline or do you think you go up or down in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, are you still comfortable given where we are and where the fundamentals of the business are with the free cash flow target outlined in the 2015 roadmap?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, a very, very good point. Let me address that starting with where we see ourselves in 3Q and year-to-date basis. So year-to-date, we are down $2 billion in free cash flow, and if you look at the drivers behind that that would be broken down into the operational performance obviously of the business, our performance on sales cycle, working capital. Those two, I would say are execution base and then the complement being the impact that we’ve seen on cash tax.
We do see that now as more and a little over $1 billion range. We originally thought more like $2 billion, we now think it’s more like a $1 billion. In the cash side of our workforce rebalancing, but that’s only the elements of that year-to-date performance, I think more importantly it’s how we see that full year 2013 free cash flow, which will be down on the year-to-year basis, how we see that moving through the roadmap to 2014 and 2015.
So in 2014, based on that same kind of structured model that I described to you, we would see our free cash flow accepting the impact of cash taxes, growing at a rate of about 15% to 20%. Now cash taxes, we believe now in 2014 will be a headwind of about $2 billion, but even including cash taxes, we would see our free cash flow growing by a little over $1 billion. So the operational profile within that in that 15% to 20% range and on that basis, free cash flow growing faster than net income.
Going to 2015, we would see that free cash flow – the inclusion of cash taxes, growing at about 15% to 20%, again free cash flow growing more rapidly than net income, and in 2015 that cash taxes should be a tailwind as opposed to the headwind that we have been referring within 2014 and 2015.
Now if you took that back if they will, let’s structure that around the financial roadmap, as you remember the roadmap, the tail what we saw in the usage of free cash flow and said, we expected to spend about $90 billion between share repurchase, dividends and acquisitions. That $90 billion on a gross basis is about $85 billion, $86 billion on a net basis and the free cash flow that we see across the roadmap is also in that range of $85 billion plus or minus, so over the roadmap those two relatively balanced and that’s not including cash inflows that we would think would be likely from potential divestitures. So with that basis even though we had a disappointed free cash flow performance this year, we still see the overall construct through the roadmap supporting those original objectives.
Now across those elements of share buyback dividends and acquisitions there is fungibility right, you’ve see that even in our to-date performance on the first two and half years of the roadmap and where share repurchase little less acquisitions so I don’t think the category or the cadence across the years would be linear. But I think the aggregate is still very, very relevant in the best guide for you to use as you look at our usage of free cash flow.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks David, can we go to the next question please.

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Ben A. Reitzes – Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yes, thanks, I appreciate it. Mark, I wanted to ask you about the $20 roadmap and the philosophy behind it, I think what our challenge tonight is going to be, when we go back to investors and we look at the base of 2013 and we exclude all the tax benefits, and you were talking about a number that might be around $16 and we are talking about trailing free cash flow around $14 and $0.60 so, eventually free cash flow and earnings tend to migrate to each other and then, let’s just forget free cash flow and started to 16 base. You got to grow 12% each year to get to 20%.
And I’m just thinking with the acceleration that we got to convince people that you are getting there so, I’m wondering what is the confidence level in the $20 based on that based on that kind of a conversation that we need to have with investors to get you there and how do you get in there, and what your confidence level as of today. Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
Yes, really the basis for that trajectory to 2015 involves; number one, in 2014 stabilizing our STG or hardware business on a profitability basis to be relatively flat on a year-to-year basis. We have absorbed this year that $1 billion decline on a year-to-year basis and I showed how I thought that really did correlate based on the work the team has done to the issues we had in China, but we believe it should be a very reasonable objective to stabilize on a year-to-year basis relatively flat profitability with STG.
And what we are able to do that the vehicle for that being new product announcements across our STG businesses as well as returning growth market to mid single-digit growth on a constant currency basis once we get through this process surrounding China’s development of a broad based economical full plan. Those two capabilities are the primary elements to stop the erosion and profitability and that part of our business. And then had the operational profile for software and services fell through the bottom line.
Additionally this impact that we wrestled with on currency again then on a year-to-date basis of $500 million headwind that kind of it’s theoretical limit, that should reverse and actually be a tailwind in the second quarter of next year.
And then lastly, if you look at the compliment to help offset the year-to-year headwind from the discrete tax benefit we have in 2013 really the flow through of the workforce rebalancing yield that we’ve already completed should be more than enough to neutralize that. And allow us to take really the financial flexibility, the strength of balance sheet, to complement that operational performance and maintain that trajectory in 2014 on our way to at least 25 up to 2015.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Ben. Let’s go to the next question please.

The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
Keith F. Bachman – BMO Capital Markets
Hi, thank you. My question is also, how do you get there in terms of 2015. And Mark was hoping you could specifically address how you are thinking about revenue growth which has been not only from a currency perspective from an absolute dollar perspective. How are you thinking about next year? And if we focus on services for the second, how does the pipeline and the backlog you mentioned is up 6%. If you’re thinking about services for FY 2014, if you can provide any dimensions about how you are thinking about the growth profile there? Is it 1%, 2% or is it small single digits?
And the second part of that question is can hardware really be a flat revenue numbers you think about CY 2014 because it seems like there still be extraordinary pressure on the market overall. And even with normal products just curious if you think that can be a flat number with all the currency assumptions that you’ve already outlined.
Mark Loughridge
Yes. First of all on the hardware base, my point was to drive the STG hardware business to flat profitability. I agree with you – I don’t’ think that is going to be necessarily flat revenue but flat profitability base…
Keith F. Bachman – BMO Capital Markets
Okay.
Mark Loughridge
All the works that we’ve done. Now I will say in the next Q, 2014 for hardware business that would probably be driving in the first half down a couple of hundred million and the second half up a couple of hundred million, but relatively flat profitability, not revenue on the STG side of the business.
Keith F. Bachman – BMO Capital Markets
Okay.
Mark Loughridge
As pointed out that’s a relatively low bar given the level of profitability that the hardware business will generate in 2013.
On the services side, I do think it’s worth clearly recognizing the real contribution that the GBS team has driven by constantly improving that backlog performance and then yielding that backlog performance right in the revenue line and let’s go back on that four quarter march that they have been on. They have been kind of methodically driving a couple of points improving over quarter, that’s why we feel it’s a very confident basis for us to look at 7% revenue growth for GBS in the fourth quarter.
And if we have 7% revenue growth for that platform with ongoing improvement in backlog given the momentum they’ve been able to drive with the faster take up of backlog to revenue for GBS that should really assist us as we go into 2014. But I think within that, the lynchpin assumption that we need to drive for 2014 and 2014 being the platform for moving into 2015 is stabilize that STG business at the low level profitability we see this year, return GMU back to mid single digit growth as we get through the process surrounding China’s development as a broad based economic reform plan, allowing the improving momentum we see on the services business as well as a return to their more consistent profile in software business help drive that operational performance.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Keith. Can we take the next question please?

The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Market. You may ask your question.
Amit Daryanani – RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, yep, thanks a lot. When I think about the implied December quarter expectations you have and given the commentary you made about the growth market headwind. Do you meet the execution issues to get resolved and see normal seasonality to achieve the implied December quarter expectations or could you get one of those two events do not happen. And then specifically just in the software side, I think it was up 1%, I would have thought it would be up more like 4%, 5%. Was there any China centric headwind on the software side as well for you this quarter?
Mark Loughridge
Well, the way I would frame the software performance is not around China. The China issue was predominantly an impact to our hardware business. The software issue I think is this ongoing challenge that we typically have in third quarters going into a stronger fourth quarter. So that’s the way I would look at this.
Now if you look at the magnitude of improvement that we’re looking at for our growth markets content, going to the fourth quarter and then into next years that profile going into 2014 remember about half of it we said we thought was macro driven that should resolve itself we believe as China establishes this broad based economical reform plan in March of 2014. And the second half of that really driven by the leadership and we do need to see that trajectory improve as of going to the fourth quarter to get back to mid single digit performance in 2014 consistent with the industry.

The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore. You may ask your question.
Robert Cihra – Evercore Partners Inc
Hi, thanks very much. If I could ask kind of a more strategic question particularly in services, if you look at your, you’re just closing the SoftLayer acquisition this quarter, and beyond adding whatever point of revenue or whatever the GTS. What does that mean for you to go-to-market strategy, does it change the look of GTS and particularly given that it’s coming at the same time. You also announced the planned divestiture anyway of the customer care BPO business for relatively low multiple. I mean when you combine those two things, are you sort of driving a more aggressive change to the look of GTS or is it just the fact that once high growth high multiple, once low growth, low multiple? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
Well, let’s separate those two. I mean the divestiture that was complementary to IBM and to the partner that we’re working with for us it was an area that we thought we could get better capability of the partner, and the partner’s capability and then we would apply our energies to broader intellectual property capability. If you look at the cloud content and the software content that we see are within cloud. We cross kind of a milestone for us this quarter worth of $1 billion of cloud revenue, the content within that about 610 million of it was the hardware and software and implementation services for us to establish cloud based operations within our customer set and then $460 million of that was cloud delivered services and solutions including software.
Now if you look underneath the dynamics in that, in that cloud delivered services and solutions content most of those customer engagement, for us, turned out to be incremental. And you remember when we started the roadmap content to drive cloud to be about $7 billion by 2015 we said that we thought only about $3 billion of that would be incremental due to the cannibalization of base. And so we’re always using that as kind of a checkpoint. Actually we didn’t see that in our own profile. Most of that content was indeed new and incremental.
So it does provide a very strong platform for us within GTS and a platform for moving to the market for other business units. I will tell you that since we’ve made that acquisition, I have heard nothing but very positive statements from our business units on the capability and the added dimension that it applies to IBM and to GTS.

The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty – Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks Mark for your comments about growth and execution improving in the fourth quarter, consider the risk of delayed U.S. Federal spending and any impact that may have on the enterprise sales cycles in the U.S.?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Let me talk about that explicitly. So if you look at our U.S. federal business, Katy, our U.S. Federal business is a little less than 3% of our total revenue mix. So as you look at the risk within that 3%, it turns out that really the bulk of our Federal business is either or not exposed or even if isn’t a category that is exposed has been deemed essential. So as we look at it, it’s kind of a time dimension. So if we close on that issue in October, there really shouldn’t be much of an impact for IBM.
If it extends through to November then it will be an issue, but something we ought to be able to deal with and manage through. If this extends in to December then it’s going to get to be a meaningful number, say around a nickel that we will probably not be able to contain. But it is kind of a time based exposure that we are tracking quite carefully. The advantage that we do have to keep that total down is how much of our business is in fact being the central.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Katy. Operator, can we take one more question please?
Operator
The last question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may ask your question.
Jim Suva – Citigroup
Thank you very much Mark and Patricia for your details. I have a quick clarification, you’d mentioned tax rate of 23%, is that what you mean going forward for every quarter or it’s kind of for the full year which means that Q4 they have to go up to something like 30%. Now the bigger question is following up on the last question about the Federal Government. Does that also impact your signings and booking in new businesses coming in, also as I would imagine there is kind of big pause there of new business being handed out?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, let’s take the bookings issue first. If you look at the business unit that would be most impacted by that exposure, it would be our GBS business. But I have nothing but very positive observations of their performances both on driving performance on a global basis generating profitability from that growth and increasing their backlog. So though that would be the area most exposed you sure wouldn’t see it in the results.
As far as the tax rate, what I’m referencing is the average tax rate that we would assume before discrete items and that tax rate would be the tax rate for the year and for the quarter. Going forward for 2013 as well as 2014, but again that’s tax rate before discrete items.
So let me now just take the opportunity to wrap up or thank you for the questions and the time on the call. Obviously this was a tough quarter for us, especially in the STG and the growth market, but we’re on track to deliver at least $16.25 for the year on an all-in basis and we believe with the actions we are taking, we’ll have stronger operational performance as we go into 2014.
In STG we’re going to wrestle with the mainframe wrap in the first half of next year, but should return to profit growth in the second half and stabilized hardware profit on a year-to-year basis for year. That’s the game plan.
And in growth markets, we’ll improve the trajectory to get back to mid-single digit performance for the 2014 full year, especially after we get to the broad based economic reform plan that’s developing in China, consistent I think on that trajectory basis for growth markets, consistent with the overall industry.
We’ll continue to use the overall flexibility of our financial model, including productivity and share repurchase and I think we are going to see that ongoing operational performance in our software and services business show through then to drive the bottom line. So this keeps us on track to our 2015 objective of at least $20 of operating EPS.
I want to thank you again for joining us and now as always it’s back to work.

Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we reported revenue of $24.9 billion and operating earnings per share of $3.22. Our EPS includes $1 billion charge for workforce rebalancing. Excluding workforce rebalancing activity in both years, our operating EPS was $3.91, up 8% year-to-year. We had good performance in our high-value, higher-margin businesses, contributing to sequential improvement in our year-to-year revenue performance and to margin expansion.
Software return to mid-single-digit growth, in fact this was the best constant currency software growth since the first quarter of 2012. Performance was led by 10% growth at constant currency and our key branded middleware and we gained share in all five brands.
In services, GBS improved revenue performance and returned to growth at constant currency, while GTS revenue growth was consistent with last quarter. With a significant amount of new business in the quarter, our total services backlog was up 7% at constant currency, or 3% at spot rates to $141 billion.
Our hardware performance was mixed. We had strong performance in system, the mainframe, which generated double-digit revenue growth at constant currency. Power and storage had a modest improvement in year-to-year performance though still declined.
Across our segments, Smarter Planet was up over 25% and cloud over 70% for the first half. Business Analytics growth improved this quarter to 11% with good performance across GBS and software. These initiatives address key market trends, like mobile, social and big data.
From a geographic perspective, our growth markets performance was consistent with first quarter at 1% constant currency growth. Major markets declined year-to-year, though improved from last quarter's rate. Overall, we improved our performance in several areas of the business this quarter and our first half operating EPS is nearly flat and that's after fully absorbing the $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge. This puts us on a good footing as we entered the second half.
So, let me spend a minute on our view of the full year. 90 days ago, when we made our first quarter earnings announcement, we said that on an all-in basis, we expected at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the full year, we also said that excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge and second-half gains, we felt confident that we could achieve at least $16.70 of EPS for the year. As you will see, we are taking this view of our business up $0.20. So, let me update this statement for new information.
First of all, the substantial second-half gain that we were counting on in our all-in view of EPS, will not likely close by the end of this year, but we are still in active discussions. As you know, we have a very disciplined M&A a process. We're not going to under price our Russia divestiture simply to close within 2013.
Consequently, we need to fully absorb the workforce rebalancing charge in the all-in view without offset from this gain. The value of this charge is roughly $0.65. Based on our performance in the second quarter, our solid prospects for growth initiatives, tough decisions on spend management and potential tax settlements were increasing our full year view of operating EPS, excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge by $0.20 to at least $16.90, and I think this is a pretty positive statement given the currencies have moved significantly against us in the last couple of weeks, especially in those that are largely unhedged such as the yen and emerging market currencies.
With that we have updated our all-in view of the year to at least $15.25, with a net impact of $0.45 driven by the elongated discussion for a larger divestiture project. We are driving to our objective of at least $20 in 2015 on an all-in basis. And in our current view, we will establish our 2014 trajectory off the 2013 base of $16.90. In other words, we will position the all-in view as if we closed the divestiture transaction to establish our future trajectory, since fundamentally whether we close the large divestiture this year or not will not have any effect on our ability to achieve our 2015 objective of at least $20 per share on an all-in basis.
So, now, turning back to the second quarter, I will walk through the financial metrics. Our revenue growth, at constant currency, was down 1%. This is a two point improvement from the first quarter rate, driven by services, software and hardware. We entered the quarter with a modest currency headwind but it became more pronounced with the strengthening of the dollar. When you look at the recorded revenue for the quarter, currency impacted our revenue growth by two points. In the current spot rate, this increases to a three point impact in the second half.
Turning to profit metrics. We expanded operating gross margin nearly a 1.5 point, led by services and mix to more profitable segments. The $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge impacts our PTI and net income dynamics. Excluding the workforce rebalancing activity in both years for comparison purposes, our operating PTI was flat year-to-year with margin up 0.8 point. Now within this profit performance, we absorbed a significant impact from currency movements.
This as a greater impact was when the Yen devalued sharply because of the limited cross-border cash flow that we can hedge. At current spot rates, the currency impact will continue. IBM's tax rate in the quarter includes a discrete benefit associated with that tax ruling received this quarter. So our operating net income, excluding the impact of the workforce rebalancing activity, was up 3% with margin expansion of 1.1 points.
With over $12 billion in gross share repurchase over the last 12 months, we reduced our share count by 4%. When you look at the major year-to-year drivers of our second quarter operating EPS performance, the 3% decline in revenue at constant margin impacted our earnings growth by $0.12. The contribution from margin, excluding this year's charge, was $0.24 but this was more than offset by $0.59 year-to-year impact from higher workforce rebalancing charges. The lower share count contributed an additional $0.18. So, operating EPS of $3.22 was down 8%. You can see the operating EPS, excluding workforce rebalancing, is $3.91, which is up 8% year-to-year on a comparable basis.
Now, I will get into the results. Starting with revenue by geography on a constant currency basis. America's revenue was down 3% with declines in both the U.S. and Canada, though both improved the growth rate slightly from last quarter. But once again we had really strong performance in Latin America, led by Brazil. Our EMEA revenue was down 1%. That’s three points better than our growth rate in the first quarter. We had improvement in the growth rate of several of the major countries. UK and Spain not only improved but grew in the quarter. In Asia-Pacific, revenue was flat. Within that, Japan's revenue was up 3% with good performance across hardware, software and services. This is the third consecutive quarter of revenue growth. So clearly the team in Japan has done a great job to return the business to growth. Growth markets revenue was up 1%. In the first half, we have had strength in Latin America and the Middle East and Africa region but declined in some of our larger markets like China and Australia have impacted the overall performance.
Turning to revenue by segment. Year-to-year constant currency revenue performance in our combined services business improved from the first quarter. At constant currency, GBS performance improved a couple of points led by consulting and systems integration, while GTS revenue growth was unchanged. In software, we had broad-based strength across our strategic brands led by our offerings in smarter commerce, social business, security and storage management.
In systems and technology, we had good performance in System Z mainframe, while we had some improvements in Power and Storage, they continue to decline. Looking at our gross profit, our operating gross profit margin improved almost 1.5, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in Services and Software and improving segment mix.
Now, let us take a look at our expense profile. Our total operating expense and other income was up 11%, or down 1% excluding the year-to-year impact of workforce rebalancing charges, so well managed on an operating view.
Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 1 point of expense growth. Currency contributed a point of expense decline, driven almost entirely by translation. Consequently, our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was better by 2 points excluding the charges.
The workforce rebalancing is the one item in expense that had significant year-to-year impact to our profit. This year's charge was about $1 billion, in line with what we told you back in April. This compares to last year's rebalancing charge of about $150 million, so about $850 million impact to profit year-to-year. We will see some of the benefits from the rebalancing activity in the second half.
Now, I want to comment on the impact of currency this quarter. In the second quarter, the hedge activity was fairly neutral year-to-year with modest gains in both periods. The dollar strengthened against many currencies, but we were significantly impacted by the depreciation of the yen.
Because our business in Japan is more heavily skewed to local services, we have less ability to hedge cross-border cash flows as compared to most other countries. I mentioned this last quarter, but the year-to-year profit impact was much larger in the second quarter. This would continue at current spot rates through the rest of the year. We saw a similar trend in the growth market currencies.
So, now let me go into the segments. This quarter, the two services segments generated $14 billion in revenue. Pre-tax profit was down 17%, reflecting the impact of the workforce rebalancing charge. Excluding workforce rebalancing in both years, profit was up 2% and pre-tax margin expanded just over a point.
Total backlog was $141 billion, up 3% of spot rates, but up 7% of constant currency. Backlog again grew in both, the transactional and outsourcing businesses. And, in fact, we had the best growth of our book of business at constant currency in four years. Within that, both major markets and growth markets grew backlog this quarter and our major markets accelerated the growth at constant currency from last quarter. We had 15 deals over $100 million including a megadeal in Europe.
Turning to the two segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.5 billion, down 5%, or down 2% at constant currency. Our outsourcing business was down 3% at constant currency with the bulk of this decline, driven by previous actions to restructure lower margin contracts. While this impacted revenue, it raised the profitability of the outsourcing portfolio, will wrap on the year-to-year dynamics in the second half though the business will continue to operate at this higher profit base.
For the quarter, we estimate the impact to revenue to be about 1.5 to GTS and a point to services in total. In Integrated Technology Services, revenue was up 1% at constant currency, led by Japan with its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.
Last week, we close the acquisition of SoftLayer Technologies, the world's largest privately held cloud computing infrastructure provider. As businesses add public cloud capabilities to their on-premise IT systems, they need enterprise grade reliability security management. IBM has built a portfolio of high-value private, public and hybrid cloud offerings.
With SoftLayer, IBM will accelerate the build out of our public cloud infrastructure to give clients the broadest choice of cloud offerings to drive business innovation. This quarter, GTS pre-tax profit decline, but adjusting for the workforce rebalancing activity, profit was up 3% and pre-tax margin was higher year-to-year by 1.3 points on this basis, margin expansion reflects improved efficiency and productivity as well as tough minded spend actions.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.6 billion, down 1% as reported and up 2% at constant currency. This represents an improvement of two points at constant currency from last quarter's year-to-year rate. From a geographic perspective, North America led the improvement and was up mid single-digit. Growth markets in Japan continued to drive solid performance and Europe slowed its rate of decline versus last quarter.
Looking at the GBS business by or two major categories, we had good result across the portfolio. Within the digital front office, we again delivered double-digit growth across the initiatives, Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. Within our back-office solutions that we call the globally integrated enterprise, we returned to growth in implementation services that support the traditional packaged applications. Turning to profit. Adjusting for workforce rebalancing activity, GBS profit grew 2% year-to-year and PTI margin expanded by 0.5 point.
So to wrap up services, growth initiatives continued to perform well and we are investing to accelerate our transformation. We have made good progress in transition areas like traditional packaged application implementations and have largely wrapped on the outsourcing contract restructuring. We are entering the second half with the strongest backlog growth at constant currency in years.
Software revenue of $6.4 billion was up 4% year-to-year or 5% at constant currency. Software PTI was down 2% year-to-year or on an adjusted basis was up 6% to $2.7 billion. Key branded middleware, which was over two thirds of total software revenue grew 9% or 10% at constant currency. Each of the five key brands gained share in second quarter. Four of the five grew double digits at constant currency. We built a portfolio of solutions that target the faster growing segments of the market including mobile, social and security. Differentiated by advanced analytics these solutions provide value to a new set of IT buyers in the front office and many these are delivered through our SaaS offerings, which were up over 50% this quarter.
Now, let me take you through the key brands. WebSphere grew 10% at constant currency. Within WebSphere, the key contributors, Smarter Commerce and mobile, grew double digits. IBM Smarter Commerce initiative helps our clients transform their business processes to rapidly respond to shifting customer demands in today's digitally transformed marketplace. Our mobile portfolio led by MobileFirst combines security, analytics and apps development software to manage clients' mobile infrastructure regardless of device. Information management software grew 6% at constant currency. Analytics runs through our portfolio of solutions, enabling clients to develop and execute a big data strategy that connects their existing business data to new data sources delivering business insights in real-time.
Tivoli software was up 14% at constant currency with growth in each of the three key business areas. Our security business had a great quarter with growth of 20% at constant currency. In the age of mobile access, [AUDIO GAP] sturdy intelligence is critical for safeguarding data, transactions and everyday business operations. Within Tivoli, storage was up 17% at constant currency. Storage software delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.
Social workforce solutions grew 23% at constant currency, driven by the recent acquisition of Kenexa and our existing smarter workforce offerings. In the second quarter, IBM was ranked number one in enterprise social software for the fourth consecutive year by IDC. Across the board, software had a good quarter with solid top line performance [AUDIO GAP], 12% year-to-year or 7% at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture of retail store solutions.
System Z grew 11% at constant currency. MIPS were up 23% year-to-year and we continue to have more than half of this MIPS from specialty engines which were up double-digits. Last week, we announced an agreement to acquire CSL International, which expands System Z's cloud capabilities, including simplified management of virtualized Linux on Z. In PureSystems, we have now sold over 6,000 systems in over 100 countries in the five quarters since announced.
While Power revenue was down 24% at constant currency, this does represent a 7-point improvement from last quarter's rate. Power continue to outperform the UNIX competition and gained share again this quarter and we continue expand our power platform to go after the Linux opportunity. We expect a sequential improvement in Power will continue in the second half as adoption of our new POWER7 plus products continues.
System x was down 10% at constant currency. Storage hardware revenue was down 6% at constant currency, but flat including storage software, which is reported in Tivoli. Strong double-digit growth in our mid-range Storwize product was offset by declines in our legacy OEM mid-range offerings and softness in the high-end. Our/products offerings contributed 2 points of year-to-year growth to total storage. Systems and Technology returned to profitability in the second quarter, excluding workforce rebalancing charges, and we expect to remain profitable for the full year.
Moving onto cash flow in the quarter, we generated $2.7 billion of free cash flow, down about $1 billion year-to-year. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $4.4 billion was down about the same. The first half year-to-year performance was impacted by a significant increase in cash taxes and lower accounts receivable collections. This was mitigated by year-to-year benefit from our capital expenditures and the benefit associated with the timing change of funding our 401(k).
Looking at the uses of cash in the first half, we acquired three smaller companies, StoredIQ, Star Analytics and UrbanCode. In the first week of July, we closed the larger SoftLayer acquisitions. We returned just over $8 billion to shareholders. Of that, $6.1 billion was in share repurchases, and at the end of June, we had $7.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. We took our dividend up 12% in April and through June we paid out $2 billion. This is the 18th consecutive year that we raised our dividend and the 10th year in a row of double-digit increases.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $10.4 billion. Total debt was $34.1 billion, of which nearly $25 billion was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at a ratio of 7.21.
Our non-financing debt was $9.3 billion and our non-financing debt to cap was 39%. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long-term.
So, let me wrap up the quarter. We had good performance in our higher margin businesses, like Software and Systems z mainframe and we had continued strong performance in our growth initiatives of Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and Cloud. We returned to growth in Global Business Services, led by consulting and systems integration. And for total services, we had the strongest backlog growth at constant currency in years.
At the same time, we took actions to better position our business for the future. We rebalance the workforce to align resources to the best opportunities and we announced and recently close the acquisition of SoftLayer to enhance our capabilities in cloud.
As we move into the second half, we expect to continue our progress in areas like Analytics and Cloud and Smarter Planet, leverage the benefits from our workforce rebalancing activity, capture additional opportunities in cost and expense through net income. And, of course, continue to return value to shareholders.
At the same time, we are dealing with a more challenging currency environment. Taking all of this into consideration we are increasing our full year view of operating EPS, excluding the $1 billion workforce rebalancing charge to at least $16.90. This is the $0.20 increase from our previous view. Because, we are no longer counting on a gain from a large divestiture in the second half, our all-in view of operating EPS is now at least $16.25. All of this is consistent with our objective to achieve at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I would like to remind you of a couple of items. First, as always, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. Second, I would ask you refrain from multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I will turn the call back to Mark for final comments.
Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we would like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays
Mark, what gives you confidence in the second half. It would seem that basically without the benefit of the tax rate, the operational increase is really $0.5 or so from what you thought previously. I just wanted to also be clear on that. What gives you confidence that you can hit those numbers? Perhaps there is specifics around how the charge closed through in terms of cost saves and then what segments could possibly grow? Where do you seem some leverage? Thanks a lot.
Mark Loughridge
Okay, Ben. A very good question. Maybe the best way for me to answer that is to take a look at a headwinds, tailwind basis. So if you look at the second half of the year, obviously, we have a headwind on currency and more specifically, within that, the Yen. We pointed it out in the attached ones that even though currency was impact of 2% in the first half, we see about 3% in the second half.
Our hardware business has been an impact. It was in the first half of the year and we are obviously dependent on the Asian GMU economy which have been challenging in the first half. But I will tell you, as we look at the second half, we have some very, very distinct tailwinds that we have driven to drive our performance.
So, first of all, software pipeline, we have got a very good software pipeline going into the second half of the year and if you look at that software performance in the second quarter, boy, they really hit the ball. So, not only did software grow the total by 5% but that key branded middleware was up 10% and we gained share in every single one of the sub brands in that software business. So we see real momentum going from that second quarter into the second half of the year.
Secondly, very, very important. We have services backlog growth on a constant currency basis up 7%. That is the best backlog growth positioning we have had in four years going into the second half, 3% at actual but that 7% at constant currency, the best we have seen in four years.
Now against that, in the second quarter, break it down by service lines, GBS returned to growth in the second quarter. They should further profit on that improvement in the interim backlog and I would expect GBS to be firmly in that mid-single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter.
Likewise on our GTS business. GTS was down in the second quarter about 2% but they had about a 1.5 point impact from those restructured contracts last year that we spent a lot of time talking about in the last year's earnings call. So if you adjust for that, they came very close to a neutral performance in the second quarter. With that, I would expect GTS to return to low single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter as well.
So now we have had good performance, a flow-through to second half from our software business, better performance from our GTS and GBS businesses driving performance, our workforce rebalancing yield. We did a great job closing that right on the $1 billion that we had advised we you we would as we close the first quarter. That will begin the yield in the third quarter of the year and will get a full quarter's benefit in the fourth quarter and I think that is quite significant.
I clearly alluded to the potential tax settlement that we would see being a positive impact in our fourth quarter. But along with that, we have had real strength in our growth initiatives. Cloud, through the first half of the year, up very, very strong. We had very good positioning on our Business Analytics in the second quarter, up 11%. Strong performance in our Smarter Planet content and we have taken a very tough position on spending.
So you put all that together, I think we have the ingredients for that second half of year and with base of all of that, in aggregate, they gave us the confidence along with the second quarter performance to drive that additional $0.20 to $16.90 excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Ben. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Historically, you have provided EPS guidance, including all rebalancing charges and any one-time gains whether it'd be from IP or from dispositions. I am hoping you can clarify, because it's a little nebulous about whether you are changing your guidance definition of operating earnings or not.
So, the traditional metric of operating earnings would include the rebalancing charge in there and then guidance would be $16.25 at least for the year. Is that what we should be putting our models, or are you changing the definition and saying what we are going to exclude these kinds of charges this year and on a go forward basis and $16.90 should be what analyst put in your model, so if you could address that and I would also like to understand to the degree that what checks and balances to the degree that you may continue to include them, but not match them in a given quarter what checks and balances are there going to be offsetting that gains and charges are ultimately offsetting as they have been historically.
Mark Loughridge
Okay. Very good question, Toni. First of all I want to be very, very clear that when we attach our objective for 2015 of $20, that at least $20 is on an all-in basis, and I think in this earnings announcement, I hope to be very clear on the basis for performance in the year. So, if you look at the performance that we would view for the year, we've been clear on the all-in basis and we've also been clear excluding the gains and charge.
Now, let me provide some distinctions on that base and why I think both of those are very important. First of all, on all-in basis, we had said that that second fourth quarter workforce rebalancing charge would be offset by a future divestiture gains. And, frankly, as we look at it now, we are in active discussions, but very likely on a timeline basis it's been likely that simply closes in 2013, so that would impact that original view of our business on all-in basis of at least $16.70 by $0.65, and then you would add the improvement of $0.20 to that. That gives us $16.25, but I won't say that on the other view of our business excluding gains and charges, that now would be $16.90, and I am reassuring you and the investors that that $16.90 that we will be using of our starting point to set our objectives for 2014 on all-in basis in 2015 on all-in basis.
So in other words, as if we have closed the divestiture. Now, why do I think that's important? I think that's important because whether we close that divestiture this year or not, would not impact that operational performance exactly as always fund it in 2014 and 2015. Number two, I wanted to be very clear to investors that when we start the positions that trajectory for performance going from 13 to 14 to 15, that number start to $16.90 Not $16.25. So, from my perspective the view of our business is best established the trajectory we are on going from 13 to 14 to 15 is an end state of $16.90 increased by $0.20 from our results $16.70 view of the business given that the large divestiture has moved out of the year we would assess the all-in at $16.25, but you know we are certainly working on other divestiture content in that we will be adding back for our basis as well. But, to reiterate, assessing this trajectory for this year, I think is best evaluated, excluding the second quarter charge and $16.90 that will now be the basis for establishing that trajectory for 2014 and 2015, and achieving our objective of at least $20 in 2015 on all-in basis.
Patricia Murphy
We'll go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Patricia Murphy
Steve, do you have it on mute? We can't hear if you are speaking.
Operator
Please don’t push any buttons.
Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities
Can you hear me now?
Patricia Murphy
Yes, we can now. Now you could start.
Mark Loughridge
Steve, are you there?
Operator
The next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.
Scott Craig - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch
Mark, can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the services business as far as the impacts that you see going forward in renegotiating contracts or maybe even exiting some of the contracts and some of the impact on the profitability that we should see as you move forward? You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you start to run into the comp issue where you are sort of getting beyond all that in the back part of the year but I am just curious as to how you see impact of that playing out have for the rest of the year? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
Well, I think on that view of the business on our contract negotiations with customers, the biggest reference point is really those restructured contracts that we drove in 2012 and as I said for GTS, that was an impact of about 1.5 point to their growth rate. So outside of that, it would have been down about 0.5 point and now with the improved backlog performance and starting forward, going into the third quarter, we would expect that our GTS business should be returning to growth in third quarter in low single-digit. So if you are looking at the impact of those restructured businesses on our year-to-year growth with this year, by the third quarter it is less than a point and it is fully wrapped by the time we get to the fourth quarter.
So the really strong signings performance we have seen from our two services business and the positive impact that tailed on come backlog, now as I said earlier, up 7% on a constant currency basis, 3% at actual should give them a very good starting point as we go in the third quarter and that restructured contract impact on growth rates should start to ameliorate in third quarter and fully wrap in the fourth.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Scott. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question please next question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks very much. Mark, I was curious to get an update on the $400 million worth of mainframe and software deals out of Q1. Did those in Q2? Just looking at some simple math, assuming half of those deals did close in the software business in Q2 or signed the software it implies the underlying demand and growth of software really wasn’t all that robust. It was pretty tepid. Maybe flat to up 1% or so. So can you comment on how those deals closed and what the underlying demand looks for your software products, excluding the timing of those deals? Thanks a lot.
Mark Loughridge
Yes, very, very good questions. So if you look at those rollover deals that we had as we exited the first quarter, they frankly distributed across the months within the quarter on a typical rollover basis and we closed a little less than half of them, which is also a typical closure rate. Though it really did not provide within the quarter a spike, if you will, and assume a normal profile for rollover deals they went through the quarter.
Now, as you look at it going into the third quarter, especially within that software business, which has very high margin content for us, we actually have even more rollover content going for software business from the second quarter to the third quarter and if you just looked at the firm pipeline that we have had for the third quarter compared to the second, we are actually in a little better shape going into the third than we were not even in the second. So I think that the performance that we saw out of software in the second quarter is a good indication of the kind of performance we had achieved from our software business going into the third quarter and I think that when you look at the mainframe business that we also had a very strong performance in the quarter. We should expect another double-digit quarter from mainframe in the third as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Chris. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask your question.
Jim Suva - Citi
Thank you, Mark. Congratulations to you and your team at IBM. I know this is just one metric, but when you look at the signings number, which was quite strong, healthy of 16.4 and last quarter was 16.9, I mean very, very strong there. Shouldn't that equate to some pretty neutral revenue growth for IBM? And, if so, am I missing something about others some larger contracts that are and how should we think about multiple quarters of back-to-back strength you've had in that metric that we use along with others? Thank you.
Mark Loughridge
Well very good question. We look at the services content. The great thing about our Services business is you sign those contracts that give you a lift and it give you lift over many, many years, right? So, an advantage, I think, that we built into our business equation is at long string annuity content services base of business, so you are not so dependent on the volatility that transactional business.
So, when you look at that that improvement in backlog entering a given quarter that is distributed over a number of years, but you started to see the impact and the benefit of that even in the second quarter. So, again, I would reiterate in the second quarter our GBS business returned to growth. As we look at the additional backlog, performance we have going into the third [now] be back to mid single-digit growth.
Our GTS business was impacted by the restructured contracts in the rearview mirror, but adjusting for that we think they were very close to kind of flat performance on an unadjusted basis, so that gives us confidence going into third quarter that our GTS business should also returned to growth in low single-digit.
Now we did sign in the second quarter 15 deals over $100 million and we signed a multi billion-dollar mega outsourcing deal in Europe. Now, the European deal is a very interesting one in itself, because IBM for this customer will transform the underlying technology including new analytics and cloud models enabling business innovation for the client, so this is great example of how the outsourcing business is evolving as clients look to IBM for supporting leveraging new technologies such as cloud.
So, as you pointed out two quarters is a very good signings performance as we have always said (Inaudible) you got to be in the backlog ensuring that the backlog did show up as we enter the second half and we are going to see that revenue impact as we start to move that equation north with positive revenue performance from GTS low single-digit and mid single-digit revenue performance in GBS.

The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs
Thanks. I hate to ask the tax rate question, but I really want to try and understand the guidance best I can. Mark, you had mentioned that you had a tax benefit as well coming in the second half is that additional to the tax benefit you had this quarter? I believe your guidance before was a pointing towards roughly at 25% rate and that's within most models, so how do we think about the tax rate in the second half relative to that and how that drives the earnings guidance for full-year?
Mark Loughridge
Okay. So, I would you look at our book's tax rate in 2013 to be in the range of 25%, excluding into discrete tax benefit charges. Now, we did get a tax benefit in the second quarter that we recognize which relatively improved that rate. And, if you look at a forward-looking basis, regarding tax settlement we do have a number of audits and disputes around the world including the 2008 to 2010 U.S. federal tax audit. We expect to conclude some of these audits and disputes later this year that could results in a favorable settlements in the fourth quarter.

The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Yes. Thanks, Mark. Given the cash flow was down considerably in the first half of the year, can you do a similar walk through of the headwinds and tailwinds you see that could help improve cash flow and also talk about whether the weaker cash generation impacts your flexibility to step up buybacks and make acquisitions to help hit the $20 2015 target if needed?
Mark Loughridge
Okay, when you look at the first half of 2013, our cash flow was down $1.1 billion. Now within that decline we did a substantial increase in our cash tax payments of $700 million. In addition, we had a deterioration of our accounts receivable days outstanding by over a day and a half and that comes at a metric of about $250 million per day. So we should have done better there and we certainly could have done better in our profit performance from the business.
Now if you look on a forward-looking basis, I fully expect that we will improve on that receivables equation and pull that cash back into the business and we should have better profitability from unit performances going to the second half as well, but I got to say that on a full-year basis, we do have a cash tax headwind of $2 billion and I don’t think we are going to overcome that on a year-to-year basis.
Now, even with that positioning, however, I feel very confident in the overall positioning for the roadmap of $50 billion in share repurchase, $20 billion in dividends and the opportunity for $20 billion in overall acquisitions. If you gauged our performance against those metrics, given this kind of a half point of the model, you know we have done $33 billion in share repurchase of the $50 billion, we have done $6 billion of the $20 billion in overall acquisitions, $9 billion of the $20 billion in dividends which puts us just reasonably ahead of pace.
So, I think we are in good position there. We do have a cash tax headwind this year but I do not think it’s going to impact our ability to complete the expenditures on share repurchase, acquisitions and dividends through 2015 roadmap.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Katy. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMC. You may ask your question.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMC
Just in terms with all-in EPS is in terms of what it was historically and what you are you going to do going forward? Maybe you can help us out one piece. Can you try and quantify, Mark, what the quarterly EPS benefits in the fourth quarter is going to be due to the workforce restructuring?
Mark Loughridge
Well, if you look at the workforce restructuring, let me give you a little color behind that. Now if you look at the workforce rebalancing, as we pointed out, that concluded at about $1 billion. In that $1 billion, the vast majority of that is spent overseas, outside the U.S. that has longer paybacks. Now from a business unit standpoint, you can see that in the math that we have provided to you, about $600 million of that would be benefiting the services business and about $200 million each for the hardware and software businesses. That will distribute across the third quarter and fourth-quarter as well as the first two quarters of 2014.
Now, given that it has generally world trade driven, we are not going to payback that $1 billion in the year, but we will see the first increment of contribution from it in the third quarter and we are going to see a full quarter of contribution in the fourth quarter of this year and then ongoing contribution in the first and second quarters of 2014.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Brian White with Topeka. You may ask your question.
Brian White - Topeka
Mark, I want to get a big picture view of what you are seeing on the IT spending landscape. So it is obviously a little light, did well on margins, but just what are customers spending on now and how are they feeling about spending in the second half of the year? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
Yes, I think if you look at overall spending, let's look at it from a couple of perspectives. First of all, just based on the dynamics we see in our business, the major markets' performance actually improved for IBM in the second quarter compared to the first quarter by about two points. Within that, as I had said earlier, Japan did a great job in this but I thought Europe as well did a pretty good job in a different environment but we do see, when you look at the growth market business, they are moving more from infrastructure-based offerings to offerings with real solutions capability like Business Analytics and Smarter Planet capabilities as they improve performance.
So, as we see that spending profile and as it exhibits itself for IBM, we see improved prospects for our services revenue base as we go into the third quarter. Ongoing strength in our software base. We do think that hardware will still be a challenging equation, but it certainly will be a mix of demand patterns mapped to our capabilities to support our objectives for the third and fourth quarter and right now we would look at the third quarter that analyst models are reasonable and we see higher double-digit performance in the fourth on our way to achieve that $16.90, at least for the year, excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Brian. Operator, can we take one last question please?
Operator
Your last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicholas. You may ask your question.
David Grossman - Stifel Nicholas
In the GMUs and the corresponding impact on the three different business.
Patricia Murphy
I am sorry David, can I ask that you start again we missed the beginning of the question.
David Grossman - Stifel Nicholas
Sure. I was wondering if you could just expand on the last question a little bit and help us understand the relationship between the growth and weakness from the various GMUs and the corresponding impact on the growth of the three business units as we go through the second half of the year and into 2014?
Mark Loughridge
Yes. Absolutely. So, if you look at our GMU performance in the second quarter did prove to be more challenging. Again, 1% growth in the second quarter as we saw in the first quarter, but underneath it was mix. So, we actually had very strong performance, I think in Latin America up 12%. And, within Latin America. Brazil was up 15%, so the whole Latin America content, I would count as a real plus for us. Middle East, Africa likewise we had 11% growth, so good performance there as well.
The areas that we had more difficulty in our growth markets, frankly, can be I think best attributed to kind of three large countries China, Australia and Russia, and they account for about 40% of the GMU base of business without those three countries GMU frankly would have been up 7% now. Within those three countries, I would tell you that China and Russia who are both, down in the second quarter '13 had a very, very big, comp to overcome. Last year China achieved 24% growth in the second quarter of 2012 and Russia had 39% growth in the second quarter 2012, so very good big compares now.
That said, we will remain cautious as we go into the second half of year in GMU, so we start to see more demand pattern driving that more typical performance level that we have seen in the past.
So, with that let me wrap up the call.
So, first of all, we are exiting the quarter stronger than we entered with good growth in our high margin businesses, a better book of business and services, and we execute as a workforce rebalancing actions that will start to yield in the third quarter. We had some opportunities I mentioned earlier, but also some headwinds but all of this was considered in our decision to take up our expectation for EPS by $0.20, excluding the workforce rebalancing charge with the second half increase in the fourth quarter.
Now earnings per share of $16.90 will provide the base for operational trajectory into 2014, consistent with our objective of at least $20 in 2015 on an all-in basis. So, once again, thanks again for joining us today. Now as always, it's back to work.

Mark Loughridge
Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we reported $23.4 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $3 which is up 8% year-to-year. But this quarter certainly didn’t close the way it started. We had solid profit performance in January, but as the quarter ended hundreds of millions of dollars of very profitable software and System z mainframe deals fell short of the goal line.
This impacted the first quarter close, but the rollover of these deals positions us for a strong start in our software and mainframe business in the second quarter. Taking full consideration of our first quarter performance and the number of actions to improve this performance, we continue to expect operating EPS of at least $16.70 for the year.
Now let me make four points about what we saw in our business this quarter. First, our total services business performed as expected with year-to-year constant currency revenue growth in line with last quarter and pretax profit up 10%. Our backlog was up 1% year-to-year or 5% constant currency driven by a lot of new business in the quarter.
Second, we had a shortfall in sales execution in our software and mainframe businesses, but with a good list of rollover transactions coupled with improved execution, we’ve got a strong hand going into the second quarter in these businesses. Third, in our growth initiatives, Smarter Planet was up over 25% and Cloud over 70%.
Business Analytics was up 7% led by double-digit growth in GBS. But our growth markets revenue was up 1% at constant currency, clearly not what we expected or what we needed. Across IBM we delivered strong growth in several of our offerings to address market trends like SaaS and mobile where we grew over 50% leveraging our organic and acquisitive investments. As these become a larger part of our business, that will contribute more to our growth.
Finally, there are parts of our business that are in transition or have been underperforming like elements of our Power x and storage product lines that showed disappointing performance in the first quarter. Here we’re going to take substantial actions.
Now, let me describe how this impacts the year. With the improved execution in our software and mainframe businesses, we would expect the operating EPS growth in the second quarter to be similar to that of the first. However, given our first quarter performance, we now expect to take the bulk of our workforce rebalancing actions for the year in the second quarter, as opposed to last year when it was distributed across the quarters.
Though we certainly don’t have a specific approved action, this will result in a charge that will additionally impact the operating EPS we report. Like all years, we have a number of actions planned to improve the business for the long-term, acquiring and divesting businesses and rebalancing our resources. This results in charges in the second quarter and gains in the second half, which we expect will roughly offset for the year.
By the end of 2013, taking into account our operational performance benefits from the workforce rebalancing activity and gains and charges, we’re confident we can achieve at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year.
Let me now walk you through the financial metrics for the first quarter. In total, IBM’s revenue growth at constant currency was down 3%. We entered the quarter with a modest currency headwind, but became more pronounced due to currency movements over those last 90 days especially in the yen. When you look at the reported revenue for the quarter, currency impacted our revenue growth by two points.
Turning to the profit metrics, our ongoing focus on productivity and our shift to higher value contributed to our margin performance. We expanded operating gross margin by a point led by services and an improving mix and we expanded operating pre-tax margin by 0.8.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, down approximately 3 points year-to-year. The lower tax rate is primarily due to benefits recorded to reflect changes in tax law enacted during the quarter, including the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2012. We expect our ongoing operating tax rate for the next three quarters to be in the range of 25%.
Our operating net income grew 3% and our margin was up over 1 point. With nearly $12 billion in gross share repurchase over the last 12 months, we reduced our share count by 4%. When you bring all of this together we delivered operating EPS of $3, which is up 8%.
Turning to cash, we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12 billion. Now we’ll get into the results starting with revenue and gross margin by segment.
Year-to-year constant currency revenue performance in our combined services businesses was consistent with the fourth quarter. At constant currency, GBS performance improved a couple of points while GTS revenue growth slowed due to continued pressure on sales into existing accounts and actions taken to restructure the low margin outsourcing contracts.
In software we had good performance in several key areas such as Smarter Commerce, Social Business, Security and Storage Management, but our growth rate was impacted by the inability to close some large transactions at the end of the quarter. In Systems and Technology, while we’re delivering good performance in System z mainframe despite the slipped deal, and in our PureSystems offerings, weakness in Power, System x and Storage resulted in overall decline.
Looking at our gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 1 point driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both Services segment and an improving segment mix.
Looking at revenue by geography on a constant currency basis, Americas’ revenue was down 3% with declines in both the U.S. and Canada, mitigated by double-digit growth in Latin America led by Brazil and Mexico. Our EMEA revenue was down 4% year-to-year, about a 0.5 lower than last quarter. Most of the major countries declined though Spain returned to modest growth.
In Asia-Pacific revenue was down 1%. Within that Japan revenue was up 3%. This was the second consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Japan reflecting the stabilization of our business in that country. The balance of AP, which is part of our growth markets declined.
Across all geographies, our growth markets revenue was up a disappointing 1%, though five points faster than the major markets. BRICs were up 3% led by Brazil, while China and Russia posted modest declines. China’s performance was impacted by weakness in large deals and a slowdown in our low-end and mid-range products.
Now let’s take a look at our expense profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 4%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove two points of expense growth. Currency contributed a point of expense decline, driven almost entirely by translation. Consequently, our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was better by five points.
I’ll comment on a couple of expense items that have larger year-to-year impact to our profit. First, workforce rebalancing was better by about $200 million year-to-year driven by a charge in last year’s result. Second, our IT income was down over $70 million year-to-year.
Typically, we talked about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. In first quarter, the hedge activity was neutral year-to-year with very modest gains in both periods. In the quarter, we were impacted by significant depreciation of the yen. As our business in Japan is more heavily skewed to local services, the ability to hedge cross-border cash flows is low compared to most other countries. This had a profit impact in the quarter, which would continue at current spot rate.
So, now let me go into the segment. This quarter the two services segments generated $14 billion in revenue, grew pre-tax profit 10% and expanded pre-tax margin by 2 points. Total backlog was $141 billion, up 1% at spot rate, but up 5% at constant currency. Backlog grew in both the transactional and outsourcing businesses. In fact, we had 22 deals greater than $100 million. We closed large transformational deals in every geography, but we have particularly good performance in our major markets where the vast majority of these 22 deals were done, and nearly half of those were new services contracts. These deals contributed to our major markets backlog, which was up 3% at constant currency and grew for the first time since the end of 2010.
Turning to the two segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.6 billion, down 4% as reported and down 2% at constant currency. There were two major categories affecting revenue growth. The first was a continuation of the decline in revenue from sales into existing base accounts. This activity tends to be more transactional in nature and economical sensitive. And as expected, GTS revenue continued to be impacted by the work we’ve done to improve profitability of the restructured low margin outsourcing contracts. That initiative has helped improved our margin performance again this quarter, but does reduce the top line. We estimate that impact to be about a point of revenue growth to GTS and to Services in total. These two items were reflected primarily in GTS outsourcing revenue, which is down 3% at constant currency.
In the Integrated Technology Services, revenue was up 2% at constant currency, led by continued strength in the growth markets and the third consecutive quarter of growth in Japan.
GTS delivered 7% pre-tax profit growth in the quarter and expanded pre-tax margins by about two points. This quarter margin expansion was driven by continued efficiency improvements, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives and lower workforce rebalancing charges.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, down 3% as reported and flat at constant currency. This represents an improvement of two points quarter-to-quarter at constant currency. From a geographic perspective, the growth markets in Japan drove the strongest performance while North America slowed its rate of decline versus last quarter.
Looking at the GBS business by offering, we had good results in our solutions that address the digital front office. We delivered double-digit growth across the initiatives; Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and Cloud. As these become a larger part of GBS, they’ll contribute more to the top line performance.
And as we address the globally integrated enterprise, our traditional back-office solution, we’re continuing to focus on improving our performance in implementation services that support the traditional packaged application.
Turning to profit, GBS pre-tax income improved 17% year-to-year and pre-tax margin expanded three points. The main year-to-year profit drivers were continued benefit from our enterprise productivity initiatives, lower workforce rebalancing charges and improved contract performance.
So to wrap up Services, we grew backlog 5% at constant currency with the major markets up for the first time since the end of 2010. Growth initiatives continue to perform well or continuing to improve in transition areas like traditional packets, application implementation and we expanded profit margins and delivered 10% growth and a pre-tax income.
Software revenue of $5.6 billion was flat year-to-year or up 1% at constant currency. Pre-tax income was up 4% year-to-year and pre-tax margin is up 1.2 points to 31.5%. As I stated up front, software growth was impacted by a number of large transactions that rolled into the second quarter. Key branded middleware grew 1% or 2% at constant currency.
Now let me give you some insight into our branded middleware performance. WebSphere grew 7% at constant currency, for the 12 consecutive year Gartner designated IBM the worldwide market share leader in the application infracture and middleware segment. In the quarter we had strong double-digit growth in Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities leveraging our organic and acquisitive investments. Our SaaS offerings contribute to the strong performance.
To address the emerging opportunity around enterprise, mobile computing, in the first quarter we introduced MobileFirst, which combined deep mobile expertise with cloud based services.
Information Management was down 1% at constant currency. The brand most impacted by the large roll over transactions. However we did hold share. Tivoli was up 3% at constant currency, driven by security and storage. Security was up 15% at constant currency driven by a security intelligence and identity and access management product segment. Security intelligence was more than double this quarter, provides solutions to help client to identify threats more quickly, prioritize risk more effectively and automate compliance activities.
Identity and access management was up double-digit, allowing organizations to mitigate risk by controlling and monitoring users’ access, which is even more critical as IT infrastructures become more interconnected.
Tivoli Storage which enables customers to manage their rapidly growing data grew 11% at constant currency. Social Workforce Solutions, which includes our recently acquired Kenexa Business grew 9% at constant currency. We began building our social business platform several years ago and we’ve been ranked as the number one enterprise social software vendor for three consecutive years by IDC. Across the software brand, as we close the transactions that rolled over, we should deliver double-digit growth in key branded middleware in the second quarter.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.1 billion was down 17% year-to-year or 13% at constant currency, adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions. System z grew 8% at constant currency. MIPS were up 27% and more than half of the MIPS were from specialty engine, which were up more than 65%. Within that Java was up 70%, database 24% and Linux nearly doubled.
Like software, as we close the large transactions that rolled over from the first quarter, we should be able to deliver double-digit revenue growth in our System z business in the second quarter. We’re also continuing to see traction in PureSystems, our expert integrated systems. We completed our first 12 months of operations for PureSystems and have sold over 4,000 systems in over 90 countries.
Power revenue was down 31% at constant currency. Our declines were driven by both the high performance computing segment where we had a strong performance last year and the impact of the transition to POWER7+
Let me step back to provide a broader perspective. We are by far the market leader in Unix. We are expanding our power platform to go after the Linux opportunity. This opportunity is of similar size to Unix but growing faster. We’ve already had some key successes with wins this quarter in China and in Europe and in fact Watson is based on Power Linux. Though this will take time to mature, it provides a real opportunity for future growth.
System x is down 8% at constant currency and our storage revenue was down 10% at constant currency. With strong growth in our new midrange products, storage growth profit was up as our organic Storwize products grew over 50% and replaced older OEM products. The value in storage continues to shift the software. Our storage software which is reported in Tivoli grew 11% at constant currency.
For systems and technology, this is not the quarter we expected. Our performance was impacted by product transitions and our own execution. We expect to improve our revenue performance in the second quarter and return to profitability excluding the second quarter workforce for balancing activity.
Moving onto cash flow in the quarter, we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow down almost $200 million year-to-year. The year-to-year performance was driven by a decline in our accounts receivable clearance rate and an increase in cash tax payments. These are mitigated by year-to-year benefit associated with the timing change of funding our 401(k) and a lower level of CapEx.
Looking at the uses of cash, we closed two smaller acquisitions this quarter, StoredIQ and StarAnalytics. We returned $3.5 billion to shareholders including almost $950 million in dividends and $2.6 billion in gross share repurchases. We bought back 12.3 million shares in the quarter, and at the end of March we had 6.2 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12 billion, up $900 million from year-end. Total debt was $33.4 billion of which over $25 billion was in support of our financing business, which has leveraged at 7.2 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $8.2 billion, down $600 million from year-end. At these debt levels non-financing debt to cap was 34% down two points from year-end. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long-term.
So now let me start to wrap up with the summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Our revenue decline impacted our earnings growth by $0.14. The contribution from margin was $0.23 with gross pre-tax and net margins all up year-to-year, driven by our move to higher value, margin expansion and services, and a lower tax rate resulting from changes in tax law during the quarter. A lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed an additional $0.13.
For the quarter, we delivered 8% operating earnings per share growth. As I said at the beginning of the call, the quarter didn’t end the way it started, so we are going to roll up our sleeves and get this back on track. First by improving our sales execution to close the roll over deals in software and mainframe, and recover our position in the growth markets. Next by taking the bulk of our workforce rebalancing actions in the second quarter, we will start to get the benefits from those actions earlier in the second half.
Finally, by taking actions to improve our under performing businesses including expanding our power platform to address the Linux opportunity and leveraging our investments in Flash and midrange storage solutions. Some of these actions will yield benefits quickly while others will play out overtime.
And of course, we are going to continue to deliver on the core elements of our business model, as we continue to shift to higher value, leverage our key growth initiatives, drive productivity across the enterprise, invest in innovation, and return value to shareholders.
Now we’ve got a lot of work to do, but we know how to get it done. By the end of 2013, taking into account our operational performance, benefits from workforce rebalancing activity and gains and charges, we expect to deliver at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year. All of this is consistent with our objective to achieve at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we would like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni M. Sacconaghi – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Yes, thank you. Mark, I just wanted to make sure I understood what you are commenting for Q2 and how that relates to the rollover impact that you have also mentioned, so I think you said that operating EPS growth would be similar in Q2 to Q1, which I think was about 3.5%. I am surprised that that’s not dramatically higher than it was in Q1, because you have a much easier comparison. And also because you’re suggesting that you had several $100 million in pushed out revenues that’s high margin. In fact, I think if you work backwards from consensus, you miss revenues by $1.4 billion, if you take our currency you miss by almost a $1 billion. If you really were on plan other than flip deals that would suggest that, you should have a $1 billion of high margin incremental deals next quarter. And I’m not sure why your pretax, why your EPS growth wouldn’t be a lot higher?
And related to that, are you expecting any EPS growth after your restructuring charges in fiscal Q2?
Mark Loughridge
Okay, let me talk through that. First of all, when you look at the second quarter, in your comments on the second quarter, we have a very good set of rollover transactions going into the second as you correctly pointed out and if you look at that composite that rolled over the deadline for us. We’re talking about more than $400 million of mainframe software and intellectual property.
Now, so that does give us confidence in the second quarter. But Toni, I did not mean to indicate that all else would also be on the original performance track. So, in fact, I still believe there are parts of our business that are in transition or have been underperforming that also were disappointing that are going to take some time to recover.
So, let me do a couple of things to help clarify that. If we look at the first quarter, I think our total services business did perform as expected on an I&E basis. Revenue was about what we saw in the fourth quarter, pretax profit was up 10%.
The real positive news out the services business in the first was in fact backlog performance. So backlog was up 5% at constant currency, and I am sure you’ve looked at all the supplementals. We’ve really had a great quarter for bookings, up almost 50%. So that drove a lot of new business in the quarter. That backlog performance is well distributed. Major markets backlog is up 3%, growth markets backlog is up 10%.
If you look at the other elements through the different axis, outsourcing backlog up 4%, transactional up 9%. So I think the teams in services delivered on their objectives on profit and they did sign a lot of new business and I would tell you, when you look at the content of the deals they too have rolling into the second quarter, they’ve got a very strong lineup.
So with that I think that for both of the services businesses, by the time we get into the second half, they should be growing at the low single digit and I peg that at about 2% constant currency for both of them. We’ll start to see this backlog really improve their performance.
Second, as you did point-out and I quite agree with your comments, we had a shortfall in the sales execution in our software mainframe businesses, those should rollover and they should present us with very good performance in the second quarter. Now, buyback, I mean in that over $400 million of mainframe software and intellectual property that rolled over, we should see our strategic middleware, I think in kind of the double-digit framework which will give us total software in mid-single digits, we should see our mainframe business at double-digit as well. So with that performance, really our STG business should return to profit in the second quarter.
Third, when you look at our growth initiatives, I think that to be quite clear about it was mixed, Smarter Planet I think did well, up 25%, our cloud business, up 70%, I thought they did well and it came across content that we sell to our customers, so they can setup a private cloud, that was up more than 75%, managing that content for our customers in private cloud doubled our software as a service business, was up 65%, so all those elements have performed well.
But on the other side, our growth markets revenue was up only 1%, so they need to get that back to that mid single digit characteristic that we’re looking for in the second quarter. If you looked at their metrics today and put them on the table, they would be pointing at mid single digit performance.
But I think to the point that I was making earlier, there is certainly our parts of business that I put in the category of underperforming and they did disappoint us in the quarter, power storage products within that, and I do think in Power, if you look at their performance in that opportunity of unit space, once again they picked up share, but it doesn’t mean much if you’re declining at double digits.
Now, part of that was compared based on high performance computing, but even if you subtract that they are double digit decline, so new products are going to take some time to improve their performance, by say six to nine months, but they also need to move into new opportunity spaces like Linux in a bigger way, we do have some real success there and the Linux market right now is as big really the Unix market and growing more rapidly.
And then in the storage products, we need to take advantage of the flash memory content that we built-up and that we reviewed in Almaden, if you look at the second quarter flash memory could improve that storage growth rate by about 1.5 and by the time we get to the fourth quarter by three to four points, but those elements are going to take more time than I think we would originally have thought.
The other point that I would tell you about the second quarter, I want to be clear about is the Yen. So the Yen had an impact, total currency had an impact of about 1.5 in the first quarter, and then we see about two points in the second quarter in the current spot rates, it would lead to a year of about two points impact; a lot of that impact is frankly the Yen, and you have seen how much the Yen has moved in a short period of time.
Now, when we hedge free cash flow, we hedge the underlying cross border cash flows, so you tend to have royalties for software, you have class or hardware content, really related to the big export business that we do.
But on services, you don’t have that underlying cross border cash flow to hedge and most of that is done on a local basis with local resources and local competitions, not many cross border cash flows and a lot of that content especially in Japan. And in Japan, the lion's share of the business and I mean we are talking 75% to 80% is service’s content.
So when we get hit by the Yen in our largest country without the ability to hedge that free cash flow on a cross border basis, that does fall to the bottom line and we have looked at the impacts in the second quarter at about $0.10.

Thanks Toni, can we go to the next question please?

The next question comes from Steven Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steven M. Milunovich – UBS Securities LLC 
Thanks Mark. First I wanted to clarify the employee workforce charges in the second quarter, are you excluding that from your operating earnings guidance or is that somehow in there? In the past, you have often been able to find gains to offset that. But it sounds like you’re kind of excluding that. Now, I just wonder if you comment on the environment, you have some execution problems in the third quarter last year. You have currently got some at the first quarter, it sounds like either you need to maybe swap out some managers or more likely everybody is missing enterprise numbers this quarter. What do you think is going on? Is it macro or is it people looking at their cloud architectures, and just delaying things and why particular at the end of the quarter.
Mark Loughridge
Okay, let me take both of those questions. I’m going to start with your first; first of all let me put this in context. So, when we gave our original guidance in January this year, we said that this year would be like other years in that we are going to buy and sell businesses. We’re going to record gains and charges, we are going to invest in innovation, and continue to rebalance our workforce to future opportunities. And we said that in an all-in basis we feel confident with an at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the full-year and that is still the case.
Now, in the first quarter, we recorded 8% EPS growth and as we look at our book of business especially the strength of the rollover deals for software mainframe, we should see similar year-to-year EPS growth in the second quarter, just as we had the conversation around Toni’s question. However, this will be further impacted by workforce rebalancing charges, which I will come back to, so in the second half of the year, we would expect our EPS growth to improve in the third quarter and further improve in the fourth quarter to double-digits. So, even excluding the second quarter workforce rebalancing charge and second half gains we feel that very confident we can achieve the 9.5% EPS growth for the year to drive at least $16.70 of EPS.
Now, remember last year we had about $800 million in workforce rebalancing charges spread across the year. This year we expect the workforce rebalancing charges to be closer to $1 billion and concentrated in the second quarter. So we really haven’t finished the work for a specific action yet. Like last year, we expect the bulk of that charge to be outside the U.S., and with that on an all in basis including all gains and charges, we’re confident we can achieve at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year just as we said in January.
Now, on your second question regarding the first quarter, let me give you a view on kind of our side of the table, the IBM Corporation and then I will give you a feeling for some of those macro issues that we also faced. So I think as we explained in the prepared remarks that by and large this is an execution problem. I mean we should have closed on those rollover deals and we thought we had them right up to the end and we put a lot of work into how to build that pipeline and our execution against it to compensate in a way for Easter at the end of the quarter. And the last time we had an Easter in March was 1Q ’05 and that was also very disappointing quarter for us.
But with those deals affected by Easter well, the bulk of that 400 plus deals that closed across the deadline, the bulk of them I mean really by far of the majority were in Europe and they were in the U.S., so it’s hard to imagine that we weren’t affected by Easter.
Secondly, if you look at the U.S. weather effect of the, some effect of the sequester that’s hard to measure, I can’t tell you that our U.S. Federal business is down 13%, which was certainly a drag on the U.S. performance. But I think the other element that in a way, we kind of misjudged. The change in the Chinese government really ripples down all the way to the provinces and state-owned businesses. And as we went through that, I mean we’re talking about once every 10 year event, as we went through that with the team, I don’t think we fully accounted for the impact that would have.
And then the last point I would make is the yen. But once again, I want to return to the point that had we simply closed on those deals, at the end of the quarter, we would have certainly had sufficient business to close the first and enter the second with the strength.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Steve. Operator, can we take the next question please?

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question
Benjamin A. Reitzes – Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Hi, Mark. I wanted to ask about your cash usage in the second quarter, if you had such good bookings, in the second half it is going to be so much better. It would seem that it would be prudent to accelerate your buyback and you have the $6 billion left. And then, I also wanted to sneak in another and ask, there are some speculation that you might sell the x86 server business on the tape and maybe you mentioned divestitures in your prepared remarks, just wondering if you could elaborate on that and clarify what we’re hearing?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. First of all, let’s talk about the cash and the implication for cash. So, if you look at the first quarter, our free cash flow was $1.7 billion and as we pointed out that’s down $200 million. Now there were two very distinct implications to that that I will cover now. But first is the impact of cash taxes; the second, sale cycle working capital. So let’s take cash taxes first. If you look at cash taxes, in fact on a year-to-year basis in the first quarter, cash taxes were an impact about $200 million, and as we phase the second quarter there will be an impact of about $900 million and for the year, as much as $2.4 billion.
So if you look at our free cash flow performance in the year, excluding that cash tax implication, I feel confident that we’ll be growing our free cash flow outside of that, but we’re not going to overcome $2.4 billion of additional taxes in the year. If you look at that as a percentage against the booked tax rate in the first quarter of about 17% on an operating basis, actually our cash tax rate was about 30%. And if you roll that out through the quarters for the year, this year it would be cash tax rate and the book tax rate we expect to relatively converge on a full year basis.
Now, let’s talk about sales cycle working capital. That too was an impact of about $200 million in the quarter. Against that what we did see is a growing propensity for late payments on customers’ growth and frankly our receivables clearance rate, the rate at which we clear them was not as good as we had expected either. And then lastly, in the negotiations on deals a lot of attention on our customer side on Ts and Cs affecting the cash flow elements, receivable payables, in some respect even more than price. So what we saw, what we took from that is lot of attention to their cash balance and holding on to that cash balance.
Now all of this content however I want to reassure you what’s considered as we went through the view of free cash flow across the roadmap in that range of $90 billion to $100 billion. And so very, very confident that we’re going to complete the $50 billion of share buyback. If you look at it, we’ve done almost $30 billion to date, $20 billion of acquisition is a very realistic number both from cash availability and opportunities and $20 billion in dividend for a total of $90 billion and with that we should still have good financial flexibility at the end of 2015.
Secondly, on speculation and rumors I’m obviously not going to comment on rumors Ben.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Ben. Can we go to the next question please.

The next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Kathryn Huberty – Morgan Stanley
Thanks. Hi, Mark. First how much of the $400 million Intel 8 deals have you closed so far in April. And then just curious if you think there is a reasonable explanation for why, IBM was able to close so many large services deals in the quarter, but customers at the same time are delaying the existence in software purchases, could we be seeing customers taking a step back and reconsidering their IT infrastructure, and maybe looking more at the cloud and needing services for that that’s delaying their infrastructure purchases? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
So if you look at the $400 million in deals, my experience in this area is when you close that baseline you kind of reset to a skew across the quarter, it does all close if you go into the next month period. Now that said we have closed some substantial deals in that category, but we’ll see those, I think kind of generally feathering across the quarter based on our customer buying patterns, not just ours.
Secondly, when you look at the services content, they just had a great pipeline of deals teed up right from the beginning. And so, if you looked at their performance on a week by week by week basis they just had a head esteem the entire quarter. If you look at the software mainframe content, I still think mainframe did a reasonable job of 8%, but compared to a more typical z series cycle, I think they could have done by our math another 100, 150 and that kind of is the quantification of the deals crossing the date line into the second quarter.
On the software side of the house they had a very good listed deals and I think this was just pure execution. We should have closed those on a sales side. We got to get off to a good start as we go into the second quarter. We had tremendous number of views with the management team and software and the financial team and software and they felt very confident in our position going into the second quarter.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katie. Can we got to the next question please?

The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
Bill Shope – Goldman Sachs
Okay. Great. Thanks. I have a question on the guidance as well. Mark, can you clarify the effective tax rate you’re assuming for the full year? I know you talked about the next three quarters, but your previous guidance coming into this year was for 25% rate for the full year and obviously this quarter the tax rate was a fairly healthy benefit for EPS. So including that does your full year guidance imply pre-tax performance that was quite a bit below what you previously expected, and given the incremental restructuring you’re talking about as well as the closing of some of these slip deals, can you talk about that shortfall relative to your previous pre-tax expectations?
Mark Loughridge 
Yeah. We would see the balance of the three quarters per year at a book rate of relatively 0.5% and putting everything into those categories and any unique events that we might have, we think that full year is probably going to be in the range of about 24%. So going through a first quarter that full year view of the business being within about 1% as I think pretty reasonable.
Now when you look at the tax rate, there are really two things that really drove that. You got to recognize when we get an event within the quarter, we have to recognize that on our tax rate, our book tax rate within the quarter. Like many that are reporting, we took advantage as we were required to. The tax extenders that was excluding the investment tax credit was in a sense the retrospect of reinstatement and that affected our tax rate, but the results so within the quarter change in tax law within New York state that also had an effect. So, really that change in the tax rate was due to change in tax law within the quarter, and the change in New York state was like March 29.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Bill. Let’s go to the next question.

The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
David Grossman – Stifel Nicolaus
Thank you. Mark, you have mentioned comments about the growth markets and it sounds like if I heard you correctly that the rollover was primarily in the U.S. and Europe and I know you mentioned China is being a surprise initiative in the quarter, but were there any other things that you can talk about that impacted growth in the growth markets and help us understand what kind of visibility if any you have on improvement as we go into the second half of the year?
Mark Loughridge
Yeah. So if you look at the content within the growth market and you look at it by the business categories, about 20% of the business in the growth market is the hardware STG content, slightly over 20%. So if you look at about a fifth of it and look at the balance of the business, the balance of the business in the software services content really performed in that kind of mid-single digit framework that we discussed.
Now, underneath that we certainly weren’t satisfied with that hardware content, but I think outside of the hardware content they did come through in that mid-single digit category that was consistent with their objective. Now if you look at GMU from kind of a category, really Latin America did a great job, up 14%. When we look at Central Europe and Russia, they tend to be transactional deals more volatile. We had in the CE or Russia, it was pretty broad swings in the quarter.
So the issue that we saw really was the growth market content in Asia, and with Asia it was pretty much specifically China. So China needs to do a good job responding from that going into the second quarter. They do have tough comparison rearview mirror for the second and third quarter. They were up mid-20s and 19% in the third. But I think they too have had a good record on hardware content. We’re not solely dependent on that hardware content and if you look at even from a services standpoint, the backlog growth in growth markets was up 10%, which should give them some opportunity there as well.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks David. Operator can we take the next question.

The next question comes from Peter J. Misek with Jefferies LLC. You may ask your question.
Peter J. Misek – Jefferies LLC
Thank you. Just a question on Smarter Planet Watson pipe initiatives, can you walk through how much of hardware revenue was tied into that and how we should be modeling that going forward? You reported that some of the Smarter growth initiatives were outstanding, but correspondingly we had weakness on the hardware side. Seems to be bit of a disconnect there. Maybe you can help reconcile that?
Mark Loughridge
Well, when you look at the business analytics content and you look at the Smarter Planet content, really the key in them is the relationship between the GBS content that lead those engagement, and frankly, the more important linkage there is the software content. That’s why when we look at the margin along those key initiatives access, they tend to be really high because that mix in software tend to be about 50%. So when you look Smarter Planet and Business Analytics, the missing ingredient there was the software content. Again that kind of got hung up at the end of the quarter.
Actually the GBS team did a very, very good job on both. And frankly, if you look underneath the GBS profile and break it down to the components parts, they did a great job in the parts of their business aligned with those growth initiatives. They were still some impact and some categories on those traditional packaged apps. Those traditional packaged apps tend to have been more a rapid turnover, but the content and the backlog that they are building along these growth initiatives should be sustaining and long-term with, I think, good margin performance. But when I look at the growth initiatives in the first quarter, the impact that was a more material I think was the software performance, the services performance did very very well, it’s that software performance that drive the margin content within them.

The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
Keith F. Bachman – BMO Capital Markets
Hi Mark could you talk a little about your confidence for the services more broadly. In the past you’ve been reluctant to provide top line expectations and you’ve indicated that you thought both GTS and GBS would have positive growth in the second half of the year, I think you even called out kind of 2% constant currency. Could you just tell that a little bit because the signings were very strong, but particularly in outsourcing so I’d be surprised if that really helped as early as the September quarter, was there other things like, you are not loosing share in the market as you, I think have been over the last couple of quarters as you get more selective, is there something going on there. In addition if you could just talk about what the pipeline looks like after the $17 billion in signings this quarter. Thank you.
Mark Loughridge
Yeah, when you look at the content in the services performance again I would kind of steer the conversation to backlog and on a constant currency basis our outsourcing backlog was up 4%, but our transactional backlog was up 9%, so we’re now seeing the GBS business as an example that they’ve been piling up backlog growth now for four years and that is going to materialize, it just tended to be as we did further analysis, it was a longer term contract, but mathematically as we went through with the team, if they can continue this rate that we’ve seen and they do have a very good deal structure going into the second quarter. Simply the math would suggest that they should be able to get back to this low single digit kind of 2% constant currency revenue growth and with that with all of the work that they have done on their cost base, which they do so well they should get a lot of leverage of that capability in the second half.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Keith. Let’s go to the next question please.

The next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. You may ask your question.
Joseph Foresi – Janney Montgomery Scott
Hi, I just wanted to kind of follow-up on that, the last question that was asked, in the services business do you feel like you fully turn the corner there, and do you expect the backlog to grow, I know you’ve given some commentary on the business growing, and then finally can you quantify or help us understand the margin impact as you become more profitable on the GTS side?
Mark Loughridge
Well, I think when you look across those services business they have done a very good job of kind of delivering on the margin capability even through more challenging revenue quarters. So the key ingredient I think to continue that margin performance is getting back to revenue performance in the second half of the year. I don’t know if I’d say we turned the corner on growth I think we’ve got to get to the second half to see the growth, but it’s pretty encouraging if you can see, 5% growth in the constant currency backlog when you’re talking about $141 billion of that. I mean that’s a lot of backlog to move in a quarter. So that’s the number one point I would make on that. But number two, we had a lot of deals in the services side of the business across that date line as well end of the second. So they certainly did not believe the pie just establishing this level of performance at the first quarter, they should have based on the deals based on the trajectory, a lot of opportunities to have another very good quarter.
Now, obviously within next quarter, mainframe or software or services, you have to close the deals, you go to win and you got to win in the customer office, so, that dimension of course, but within that the opportunity to do well in the second quarter I think is certainly there and that should drive second quarter revenue performance.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Joe. Operator, let’s take one more question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask you question.
Jim Suva – Citigroup
Thank you very much. And Mark, just a quick follow-up; on the service side, where do we take a look at the backlog and or the signing, can you help us understand about, were those improvements that you saw, are they concentrated on a couple of customers that were larger in size or they’re just scattered amongst a lot of smaller ones and maybe what geographic locations that you saw on backlog and signings?
Mark Loughridge
Well, I think the best answer, when you look at the content underneath that, I mean we had, it wasn’t like one content. We had 22 deals over 100 million, so there is a lot of flow in those deals and there was a lot of flow on the GTS side, there was lot of flow on the GBS side. This was not just one deal. It was well distributed. We had 22 deals over 100 million, there is a lot of deals over 100 and it was across the geography. So I think that was good performance.
So now let me make a few comments to wrap up the call. We are clearly not immune from changes in the global economy. We have a good set of plans and actions to achieve our objective of at least $16.70 of operating EPS for the year. First, our sales team need to close those rollover transactions that we discussed. Second, we’re going to regain our position in the growth markets and the growth markets team need to lead that. I mean if you look at the metrics right now, it clearly points in GMU to that mid-single digit constant currency performance and mainly to get that back on track.
Third, we’re going to rebalance our workforce to better align our resources to opportunity. Fourth, reposition Power to address the Linux space. And five, capitalize on our flash technologies and storage node. Clearly those last two will take some time, it’s not going to all prop back in the second quarter, but it should give us a better trajectory as we go through the year.
We’re managing our business to be successful over the long-term. So not only did these actions support our view of the year, but they’re part of a model that continues transformation as we move towards the 2015 roadmap objective of at least $20 of operating EPS.

Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. I'm here with Mark Loughridge, IBM's Senior Vice President and CFO, Finance and Enterprise Transformation. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings presentation.

You will find reconciliation charts at the end, and in the Form 8-K submitted to the SEC.Let me remind you that certain comments made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC, from the IBM website, or from us in Investor Relations.Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark Loughridge.Mark LoughridgeThank you for joining us today. In the fourth quarter, we improved our year-to-year revenue growth rate, primarily in higher margin areas, driving significant margin expansion and profit growth. We delivered operating earnings per share of $5.39, which is up 14% year-to-year and generated $9.5 billion of free cash flow.For the full year, we delivered revenue of $104.5 billion and expanded gross pre-tax and net margins. Our operating EPS for the year was up 13% to $15.25 and we generated $18.2 billion of free cash flow. That’s up over $1.5 billion year-to-year.Now let me put this full year EPS and cash flow performance in perspective. This is the tenth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. So a decade at a double-digit pace. And $18.2 billion of free cash flow is $12 billion higher than a decade ago. That’s an increase in the cash flow we generate in a year, not accumulative increase.Looking at our fourth quarter by segment, our performance was led by continued momentum in our growth initiatives and successful product launches in our high end systems. Both of which drive a more profitable mix. We had another good quarter in software. The performance was broad-based driven by business analytics, smarter commerce and cloud, with strength in several of the emerging areas where we have been targeting our investments like social business, mobile and security. Our new hardware product introductions really performed in the quarter.We had excellent acceptance of our new mainframe and our System Z revenue was up 56% year-to-year. So it has been a very successful launch. Not only in major markets but in growth markets where we were up 65%. And we had significant growth in our mainframe specialty engines, led by Linux. This is a good indicator not only of new workloads moving on to the platform but also the value of a vertically integrated system.The year to year revenue performance on our total services business was fairly consistent with last quarter. Once again we had strength in all of our growth initiatives which are becoming a larger part of the business. While IBM’s revenue was down 1% at actual rates, it was up 1% at constant currency adjusting for the divestiture of our retail store solutions business. That’s a 2 point improvement from last quarter’s constant currency growth rate. Consistent with our business model to move to higher value areas, we had revenue growth in our higher margin businesses.The improving business mix and our productivity initiatives drove 10% growth in operating pre-tax and net income. Now looking at the margin dynamics, we expanded operating gross margins by over two points with improvement across our major segments in a continued mix to software. With our ongoing focus on expense productivity, we improved operating PTI margin by 2.6 points. This quarter our operating tax rate was flat year to year and we continue to expect an operating effective tax rate in the range of 25% for 2013.Our net income margin was up almost two points and with 12 billion in gross share repurchase over the last 12 months, we reduced our share count by 4%. When you pull this all together, we delivered operating EPS of $5.39 which is up 14%. For the year, operating EPS was up 13% to $15.25. Our strong earnings performance drove $9.5 billion of free cash flow. Terrific performance for the quarter and for the year over $18 billion of free cash flow, a record for IBM.Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand our margins, grow profit, generate cash, and deliver shareholder value. And in 2013, we expect to deliver at least $16.70 operating earnings per share for the year, keeping us on track to our objective of at least $20 in 2015. Looking at the geographies on a constant currency basis, Americas revenue was up 1% led by terrific growth in Latin America. The U.S. revenue was down 1%, a 3 point improvement in the year-to-year growth rate compared to third quarter. Canada was down 9% off of last year’s very strong growth of 13%.EMEA’s revenue decline of 3% reflects the macroeconomic climate in the region. It was challenging this quarter in the UK and Germany though we did see an improvement in Italy. Asia Pacific growth improved to 5% led by Japan. Early in 2012, we said that we expected our performance in Japan to stabilize in the second half of the year. And in fact, we returned to growth this quarter. So we had great performance from the team in Japan. Across all of the geographies our growth markets delivered 7 points of outpacing major market by 9 points. The BRIC countries delivered 14% growth, the strongest quarter of the year. Brazil contributed to almost 20% growth in Latin America.We also had good performance in Africa, led by South Africa and the Middle East. In fact across all of our growth markets, we had double-digit growth in over 30 growth market countries reflecting ongoing broad-based strength.Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment, year-to-year revenue performance in our combined services businesses was fairly consistent with the third quarter. At constant currency, Global Business Services year-to-year performance improved modestly while Global Technology Services revenue growth slowed a bit. We had good results across our software business with growth in all of the key brands and particular strength and share gains in WebSphere, Lotus and Rational.In System Technology, we returned to growth adjusting for the divested RSS business. This was driven by powerful performance in System Z.Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 2.1 points to 52.3%, driven by a combination of the strong mainframe growth, good margin expansion in both services segments and improving segment mix due to the relative strength of software. Finally, our Global Financing Business delivered over 40% return on equity.So now let’s take a look at our expense profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 2%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. Year-to-year benefit from currency translation and hedging moderated this quarter, contributing about a point of expense decline. Consequently, our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was better by 3 points.Turning to the expense items that have more significant year-to-year profit impact, I’ll comment on just one item. Our accounts receivable provision was about $20 million in the quarter, an improvement of almost $70 million from last year when we increased the provisions to reflect the European credit environment. Typically, we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. However, this quarter, there was effectively no period or year-to-year impact on expense due to our hedging programs.So now let me get into the segments. In the quarter, the two services segments delivered $15 billion in revenue, grew pre-tax profit 4% and expanded pre-tax margin by 1 point. Total backlog was $140 billion, up $1 billion year-to-year of constant currency, driven by growth in the transactional businesses.From a geographic perspective, the growth markets backlog was up 15% at constant currency. For the year, the combined services business grew profit 10% and expanded margin by nearly 2 points, excluding workforce rebalancing charges in the third quarter.Turning to the two segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.3 billion, down 2% as reported and flat at constant currency. There were two major categories within the major markets that affected revenue growth. First, we did a tremendous amount of work to address a number of low margin contracts to improve the profitability of the outsourcing portfolio. We see the benefits of that work in our profit and our margin performance, though it does have some impact on revenue. This quarter, the impact was 1 point of revenue growth to GTS and to services in total.Second, we saw a decline in revenue from sales and volumes into existing base accounts. This activity tends to be more transactional in nature and economically sensitive. You can see the impact of these in our GTS outsourcing revenue which was down 2% at constant currency.In outsourcing, we continued to have strong performance in growth markets with revenue up 8% and backlog up 9%, both at constant currency. This backlog growth reflects an ongoing trend as our clients are building out their infrastructures and scaling to meet the growth objectives of their businesses.In Integrated Technology Services, revenue was up 3% at constant currency with the growth markets up double digits at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered 5% pre-tax profit growth in the quarter and expanded pre-tax margin by over 1 point. This quarter, margin expansion resulted from increased efficiency and productivity from our focus on automation and processes, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives.Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, which is down 3% as reported and down 2% at constant currency. From a geographic perspective, the growth markets turned in solid performance and the recovery in Japan continued as they grew for the second consecutive quarter.Looking at the GBS businesses by offering, the growth initiatives continue to drive strong performance. We had solid double digit growth in Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and Cloud and for the year, these initiatives now represent over a third of our total GBS revenue. So as we retool the GBS business and mix to higher value work, these larger, more complex engagements are having a positive effect on GBS backlog. In fact GBS backlog has now grown for the fourth consecutive year at constant currency though mixing to longer duration engagements. And as I stated last quarter, we have been taking actions to address the more traditional package application work.We have added partners to this base and have increased sales capability. We have targeted and closed large transformation opportunities in the growth markets and we have already seen some success in building the backlog in those areas this quarter.Turning to profit, GBS pretax income was flat year-to-year and pretax margin expanded 0.5 point. Improved utilization and service delivery helped to overcome the impact from revenue. For total services, we are providing you with additional detail around the projected total services revenue run out from backlog in 2013. This includes the impact to revenue from the work we have done to restructure a number of lower margin contracts in our outsourcing business primarily in the U.S.Now keep in mind that revenue generated from backlog is approximately 70% of total revenue in any year, with the remainder coming from transactional signings in the year and sales and volumes in our existing client base. In 2013, the projected revenue generated from backlog is up 1%. This includes 2% growth from the backlog and 1% [hurt] from those restructured contracts. But despite the impact to revenue growth, these restructured contracts have lifted the profitability of the portfolio. They provide substantial year-to-year growth profit improvement in 2012 which carries through to 2013 and will contribute modest profit growth in 2013 off this higher profit base.So for total services, as we enter 2013, we will continue to drive our key plays and shift towards higher value content. We will continue to invest in the growth markets, which now represents over 20% of total services revenue and is where we see the most opportunity for growth. We will continue to be aggressive in transforming our portfolio to higher value content and away from the more commoditizing labor based content. Our profit and margin performance will continue to benefit from the work we are doing with research and software to infuse more and more IP into our offerings.In addition, Services is the primary beneficiary of our focus on enterprise productivity. Overall, we think we have a good set of opportunities to continue to drive profit growth and margin expansion in 2013. Software revenue of $7.9 billion was up 3% of 4% at constant currency. Key branded [middleware] grew 6% at constant currency and gained share as we continue to be the clear leader in the middleware market. We had continued momentum in our growth initiatives with strong performance in business analytics, smarter commerce and cloud. These initiatives cross all of our software brands.Our results reflect the sustained investments in our strategic branded software. In addition to our organic investments, acquisitions provide additional capabilities while leveraging the existing portfolio of offerings. For example, in the first quarter of 2012 we acquired Worklight, a provider of mobile software which enables enterprises to manage and secure mobile applications. Worklight is now an important addition to our mobile strategy and has accelerated from $1 million a year business when it was acquired, to generating tens of millions for the year. Worklight is just one example of our ability to leverage and grow acquired businesses.Looking across our software portfolio, we grew the pre-IBM transactional revenue of our 2012 acquisitions by nearly five times. Now let me take you through the revenue drivers from a brand perspective. WebSphere grew 11% and continued gain share. We continue to expand our portfolio to capture the emerging opportunity around mobile computing and saw significant uplift in some of our core WebSphere offerings, such as application servers and commerce. As a result, we are well positioned to continue to help enterprises build, connect, run and manage their mobile applications.Information management was up 3% at constant currency and held share. We had strong performance in information integration and predictive analytics, both driven by big data. Tivoli software was up 5% at constant currency and held share. Performance was led by our storage and our security offerings. Revenue from our storage portfolio was up 13% at constant currency reflecting the value of storage software. Tivoli Security was up 16% at constant currency, driven by Q1 Labs which provides next generation security intelligence.We continued to transform the Lotus portfolio to the faster growing social business offerings and consequently, we had 9% growth in Lotus revenue, gained share and had a great quarter. This was driven by strong performance from our existing social business offerings and the recent acquisition of Kenexa, which we closed in December. Kenexa, a leading provider of recruiting and talent management solutions, helps clients create a more efficient and effective workforce and brings a unique combination of Cloud based technology and consulting services to an already extensive portfolio of social business solutions.Rational posted double digit growth of 12% and gained share. Software had a solid quarter, with revenue up 4% at constant currency, pre-tax income up 8% and pre-tax margins up 2.4 points. The fourth quarter rounds out another good year for our software business.Systems and technology delivered revenue of $5.8 billion, up 4% adjusting for the divestiture of retail store solutions. This performance was driven by our new mainframe and momentum in PureSystems, our expert integrated system. In fact, in its introductory year, we have already sold more than 2300 PureSystems in more than 70 countries.System Z revenue grew 56%, driven by our first full quarter of our new mainframe. MIPS grew 66% year-to-year. This is the largest quarter of MIPS shipments in history. About half of these MIPS were specialty engines, which were up 80% year-to-year, driven by Linux workloads, a good indicator or new workloads moving to the platform. Growth in Z was up 50% in the major markets and up over 65% in the growth markets. In the growth markets, we had strong sales to our established as well as new mainframe customers. This performance reflects a technology leadership and value of our vertically integrated stack that IBM’s new flagship server is delivering to our customers. It is simply the fastest and most capable enterprise system to date.Turning to Power where revenue was down 19%, our new P7 Plus midrange and high end Power servers performed well. We will continue the refresh of the Power portfolio in the first half of 2013.Our success in competitive take outs continued in the fourth quarter. We had over 350 competitive displacements, resulting in over $335 million of business, about half of which came from Oracle Sun and half from HP. For the year, we had nearly 1,200 competitive displacements resulting in over $1 billion of business.Our storage hardware revenue was down 5% driven by tape. Disc was flat. Within Disc, we announced the new high end DS8870 in October and it was sold out in the quarter. This will continue to ramp in the first quarter.Our systems and technology pretax income was up 23% year-to-year, driven by new product introductions in mainframe, power, storage and of course PureSystems.Across all of our segments, we’re continuing the strong performance in our key growth initiatives. These are not standalone offerings but integrated into our client offerings and included within our segment results.In the growth markets, our revenue was up 7% at constant currency and these countries now represent 24% of IBM’s geographic revenue. That’s up 8 points since 2006 when we introduced our 2010 roadmap. So we’ve been very successful in capturing the opportunity in these faster growing markets. We’re doing this by continuing to expand into new countries and territories to build out IT infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key industries. To drive market expansion in 2012, we accelerated our opening of new branch offices. This year we doubled the number of face to face branches, bringing the total number of face to face and virtual branches in the growth markets to almost 450. So this is tremendous growth.Our business analytics initiative continues to expand, allowing clients to make informed decisions everywhere in their organization to improve outcomes and to manage risk. We made significant strides and expanded our leadership position in a number of strategic areas, including risk management, price and promotion optimization and sales performance management, just to name a few. Our value proposition and business analytics uniquely leverages the integration between our software portfolio and GBS consulting expertise. This year business analytics grew 13% led by our GBS consulting practice.Our SmartCloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements. We have seen continued strong demand for our foundational offerings in hardware and software that help companies build and run their private clouds, as well as for cloud-based solutions like our SaaS offerings. With strong global growth, our cloud revenue for the year was up 80%. In 2012, we launched our family of PureSystems expert integrated systems as well as our SmartCloud Enterprise Plus public and managed private cloud offerings for large enterprises. These offerings further extend our cloud capabilities.We saw tremendous expansion of our Smarter Planet growth initiative over the last 12 months measured in terms of offerings, markets, customers, and revenue. Our clients are leveraging our growing capabilities in areas like smarter commerce or acquisitions such as Emptoris, DemandTec and Tealeaf helped fuel growth in new market segments. Social business for our industry leading social platform and Kenexa, come together in a powerful combination to allow our clients to engage a smarter, more effective workforce.Smarter cities which includes a portfolio of solutions ranging from public safety to social services to intelligent water systems. And finally, our next generation analytics systems like Watson which are helping tackle some of the most complex challenges facing our customers. For the year, our Smarter Planet solutions generated more than 25% revenue growth. When you look at our offerings in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of our revenue is software. So as these offerings become larger parts of the IBM business, they are driving a higher quality revenue stream, improving our mix and our margin.Turning to cash flow, we generated $9.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That’s up almost $600 million year-to-year. In line with past year, is about half of our annual cash flow was generated in the fourth quarter. And on a full year basis, we generated $18.2 billion of free cash flow which is up $1.6 billion over last year. Within our strong free cash flow performance, our capital investments are up by almost $250 million. The year-to-year improvement in free cash flow reflects our growth in net income and as you will recall the fact that our 2011 cash flow was impacted by income tax payments for audit settlement activity in the first quarter of last year.When I look at the uses of cash for the year, we continue to return significant value to shareholders including $3.8 billion in dividends and we bought back $61 million for $12 billion. Net of the cash we received from options and employee stock related transactions, our cash outflow for share repurchases was $10.5 billion. At the end of the year, we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. In addition, we spent $3.7 billion to acquire 11 companies. In the fourth quarter we acquired Kenexa. Over the course we acquired DemandTec, Emptoris, Platform Computing, Tealeaf and Texas Memory Systems, to name a few to add to our capabilities in analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet.We also acquired Vivisimo, which expands the breadth of IBM’s big data capabilities and creates the most complete end to end big data solution for our clients. Over the last three years we have spent $11.5 billion for acquisitions. To wrap up the cash dynamics for the year, we generated $18.2 billion of free cash flow and spent $18 billion on acquisitions, net share repurchase and dividends.Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.1 billion. Total debt was $33.3 billion of which $24.5 billion was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $8.8 billion down $1.6 billion for the third quarter and up $800 million from a year ago. Now let me spend a minute on our retirement related plans and the impact to the balance sheet.Despite volatile market conditions in 2012, we had good returns on global assets exceeding our expected return on assets in the U.S. and on a global basis. But the discount rate environment remained challenging, resulting in $5 billion impact to equity at the end of the year due to the pension liability re-measurement. As a result, our debt to cap ended the year at 36%, up 4 points year-to-year, including a 6 point impact from the pension re-measurement.At the end of 2012, our defined benefit qualified plans continued to be well funded and our cash requirements remain stable. We have included supplemental charge to cover ongoing dynamics in our pension plans. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility.So now let me wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Our total revenue performance had little impact on our profit growth, but we did have good revenue growth in our higher margin areas which significantly contributed to margin expansion and profit growth. You see this in our margin expansion which was the largest contributor, driving $0.47 of EPS growth through a combination of gross margin improvements and expense productivity and a lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed $0.24. Bottom line, we delivered 14% EPS growth in the quarter and 13% for the year. As you can see, the profile for the full year is very similar to the fourth quarter.Our results demonstrate the strength and flexibility of IBM’s business model, which is designed to deliver profit in cash on a sustained basis. In 2012, we continued to deliver value to our clients and capitalize on key trends. We had strong performance in Analytics and Cloud and Smarter Planet, key initiatives that leverage our software portfolio and contribute to our margin expansion. We continue to expand our capabilities and build out infrastructures in emerging markets. This year, our growth markets revenue outpaced major markets by 8 points.We continue to invest for innovation. Our investments supported the introduction of our new System Z mainframe, our PureSystems offerings and our new storage and Power7 Plus products and we just were named number one in U.S patents for the 20th consecutive year, with many of the patents issued this year in key areas like analytics and big data, cyber security, Cloud, mobile, social networking and software environments.We invested almost $4 billion in 2012 to acquire 11 companies, adding significant capabilities to support our growth initiatives. At the same time, we divested our retail store solutions business as we focused our smarter commerce portfolio on the higher value IP based opportunities. So as you can see, in 2012 we continued the transformation of the business, shifting to higher value areas and improving our structure. This results in a higher quality revenue stream.So while our overall revenue performance was modest, we had 8% growth in our operating net income and expanded net income margin by 1.6 points, well above our model level and we delivered operating EPS growth of 13% for a decade of double digit EPS growth and over $18 billion of free cash flow, a record for IBM. This demonstrates a flexibly of the IBM business model.In 2013 we’ll continue this transformation. We’ll acquire key capabilities, divest the businesses, rebalance our workforce and invest in innovation. Bottom line, we’re continuing to retool our skills and our offerings to shift to higher value and meet our clients’ needs. We’ve taken all of this account in our view of 2013. We expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $16.70 for the year, with the first half growth rates slightly higher than the second. And now, two years into our 2015 roadmap, we are well on track to our objective of at least $20 of operating earnings per share.Now Patricia and I will take your questions.Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator instructions). The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.Bill Shope – Goldman SachsThank you. On your prior earnings call, you had mentioned that the month of September was more challenging than the first two months of the third quarter. Can you talk about how the broader demand environment and your execution evolved into the December quarter? And was there anything unusual this time around that you would call out in terms of linearity?Mark Loughridge
Good question, Bill. Really if you look at the monthly performance across the quarter, it was really pretty constant. We saw a good performance through the quarter. Obviously, within that we feel very, very good about the performance we saw in our software business with key branded middleware up 6%, a breakout performance from our Z Series content, revenue up 56%. Within that the growth markets up a, I think, spectacular 65%. MIPS up 66%, the biggest MIPS performance in the history of the IBM Corporation.And so ongoing contribution from our base businesses. And with all that, to generate half of our free cash flow in the quarter and a total of $18.2 billion, the largest ever, up $1.6 year-to-year. I think that was just a very, very strong quarter. But if you look across the months, it was fairly constant month-to-month.OperatorThe next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford BernsteinI was wondering if you could comment on your expectation for services revenue growth in 2013. The reason that I ask is, I think on the fourth quarter call last year you talked about getting about 3 points of revenue growth from your backlog driven businesses. And you ended up with services at constant currency about flat this year, suggesting that non-backlog revenue growth was down about 6% in the year. So if you are looking at backlog revenue growth or revenue from backlog only growing about 1% this year, and again you struggled and had weak current period revenue growth this year. Why shouldn’t we be thinking about revenue growth being down in 2013 in the services business overall?Mark LoughridgeSo very good question. Let's start by looking at our GBS business. So the GBS business, if you look at the backlog over the last four years, they have actually been growing that backlog each year as they move into 2013. Now within that, as we explained in our third quarter call dynamics, you see a retooling if you will, or a mix shift, into these higher value initiatives that are so important to the IBM Corporation because those growth initiatives drive about 50% software in their mix and so they have a very high profit for the corporation. But if you look at that retooling from the GBS perspective, they tend to be longer duration.And so as we look at that duration and four years of backlog growth, both transactional and in total for GBS, we feel that as we enter 2013 GBS should once again return to revenue growth. If you look at the point that you had made on backlog run out, we included that very discrete chart for the following reason. If you look at the backlog content moving into the year, we were impacted to some degree by the contracts that we restructured as we went through the end of 2011 to 2012. And that magnitude was about a point.Now that’s the point on revenue. How did that perform on a gross profit basis? The fact is, it was a substantial improvement in our growth profit dollars. In 2012 we had a lot of growth in our GTS business driven by that. But that improvement in gross profit dollars in the sense, Toni, it raises the waterline and continues into 2013. And that’s a very big point. That improvement that we saw across those contracts because we maintained about 80% of the revenue within those contracts generally drove a much higher level of gross profit dollars in the ongoing base that we will enjoy this year. And in fact we will see some modest improvement in the year-to-year gross profit from those contracts moving into next year.So net-net, the gross profit dollars coming out of the backlog are much stronger because of that. So we expect the overall performance of the gross profit dollars coming out of the backlog to be more typical of say a 2% backlog growth and necessarily 1%. At 2%, very close to the dynamic we saw last year. And with that dynamic, the services businesses did a good job of driving to the model.And I think the last point that I would make in this roll-out, we had about $3 billion worth of very strong contracts roll-out off the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We have already closed $1 billion of this. And if you look at the complexion of those contracts, they come in the -- many of them in the growth markets where we’re having real success on that operations – and the value-adds that we’re showing our customer base. You see it reflected really in the backlog in our growth markets which for total services base, that backlog is up 15%. So, really strong performance on that basis. You put all that together, we feel very confident as we go into 2013 that the profit generation from our service business in total should meet our model expectations and frankly, if you look at the first quarter of 2013, we think that the services business to generate double digit profit growth.OperatorThe next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.Ben Reitzes – Barclays
Hi. Mark, wanted to talk a little bit more about your roadmap. Your tone sounds a lot better than three months ago. You've grown EPS over the last three years in the mid-teens, maybe 14% average or so and 13.5% this year. And in order to make the roadmap, all you have to do is grow 9.5% the next three years to get there. So that would be slower than you've been doing. Can you talk about your confidence and overachievement and maybe preview some of the tone in what you may say at your Analyst Day coming up soon?Mark Loughridge
Sure. Well, I think when you look at it, that at least number for 2013 at $16.70; I would have said that, Ben that rounds to $10, but at any rate. At $16.70, that's the at least number for the beginning of year and I think if you look at that relative position, that’s pretty consistent with what we've said the last couple of years. Additionally I’d point out, when you look at the generation of value from the Corporation, I think it's worth stepping back and just recognizing that the performance that we saw in 2012 was in fact the 10th year of double-digit EPS growth out of this place. That is a pretty big number. So underneath it, to drive that, we've driven this business to big growth opportunities in the higher value, higher margin spaces.Stepping back again, you think about since 2010 alone, we've invested $19 billion in R&D, $12 billion in 34 acquisitions. If you look at the enterprise productivity initiatives that we're driving for $8 billion over the roadmap, fully about 60% of that is driven to reinvest in growth initiatives like GMU, Smarter Planet, cloud and Business Analytics. So from my perspective, to drive that level of performance we're plowing investments hand over fist, back into the business. Now what are the results? Are we seeing this? Well, let's look at Software. Since 2000, Software has gone from $2.4 billion annually. 2012 we did $4 billion in the fourth quarter alone and $11 billion for the year.Free cash flow, that $18.2 billion that we talked about, 2000 was $6.7 million and in fourth quarter of '12 we had the largest MIPS shipment in the history of the Corporation, with our GMU content going from 16% of our business mix to 24% since the 2006 initiation of the business model. So I think as we look forward those growth initiatives, the effect that they're having, their ability to continue to move that higher value content and continue that growth gives us a lot of confidence, not only in what we'd see in 2013, but our remaining roadmaps to 2015.Ben Reitzes – BarclaysOkay. Thanks a lot.OperatorThe next question comes from Steven Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.Steven Milunovich – UBS SecuritiesA question on the Power side. I guess the 90% decline, I was a little surprised there, particularly since you had indicated you had a new high-end product. Is this the UNIX business finally kind of turning over like everybody else's? And I was also curious, how much of your PureSystems, what's the hardware breakout there S86 versus Power?Mark LoughridgeWell, if you look at – for your first question, Steve, one thing that we've recognized in the rollout of the cycle of the product introduction, when we introduced new Z cycle product, it hits right with the announcement and you've seen that in the performance that we've generated in this fourth quarter. Frankly, in a Power systems announcement, many of those volumes go to our customers and product test evaluations before that customer goes to volume shipment.And so generally in a Power announcement, volume shipment, especially for mid-range and high-end which we had in our announcement, that will lag by a couple of quarters. So I wouldn’t really expect to see the volume shipment again, those announcements, till we get into the second quarter of 2013. Now with that, Power once again had a very strong competitive replacement. You know 330 customers, over 300 million. And if you look at that mix, about half from HP and half from Oracle, Sun. But the effect of that overall volume shipment really we will see in about the second quarter of 2013.OperatorThe next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.David Grossman - Stifel NicolausMark, can we just follow-up a question I was asked earlier. Obviously the focus on margin impacts revenue growth, so how should we really think about this trade-off as we go forward through the road-map. As revenue growth accelerates, we prepared for margin expansion to moderate even though we are getting some benefits from mix.Mark LoughridgeWell, I guess I would look at it this way. First of all, let's look at the operational, model driven plays to drive margin. And if you looked at our -- maybe one way to look at it -- let's look at the fourth quarter. So fourth quarter PTI margin expanded by 2.1 points. That’s about $2 billion. And I would attribute about half of that to the ongoing effect of the model driven initiatives from margin. And those two model driven initiatives are continuing to mix to higher margin categories like the software business. And then the second category would be all of this spend takeout that we see in kind of the support structures around the business that we call the globally integrated enterprise.Well, I don’t think either of those impact your go-to-market pricing content that you see in your business. That go-to-market pricing content, it’s really going to be dependent on the competitiveness of your offerings at the client, not the spend structure in your back office enterprise. Nor will that margin improvement impact revenue growth simply by mixing into those higher margin spaces like software. And I think if you looked at that 2.1 points of margin growth in the fourth quarter, I would attribute about half of that to those ongoing initiatives we have to drive performance in margin for the business units.The other half were unique items that we drove during the year. So a good example of unique item that did drive real profitability was the work we did on those contracts that we did in services. To restructure them with our customers we maintained about 80% of the revenue but the profit generation out of it was quite significant. And that play alone produced about a third of that balance of a point of margin growth in the billion dollars. That generation is going to continue into 2013 because once again I would describe that as if we raised the water level on the ongoing contract performance.OperatorThe next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners. You may ask your question.Rob Cihra - Evercore PartnersI was wondering with the software shortfall you had in Q3, a meaningful part of that at the time you had attributed to growth markets and it looks like obviously you closed that in Q4. I am just wondering if that’s, you feel a function of growth markets environment getting better or were you simply able to close those and yet you are still looking at growth markets that maybe the environment is still weak. So I am just wondering how much of that is sort of improvement in the environment or simply you are booking those and the environment is still soft?Mark LoughridgeNo, I think we had performance in the fourth quarter from our software business. It was more consistent with the ongoing performance we are looking for in their business model. So I think they did a pretty strong job here as they went through the quarter. Let's just go through some of the elements. IDC now ranks them number one in bringing social software to the business environment. Tivoli grew 5% against strength in the overall storage offerings. Rational, 12%, gained share. WebSphere, 11%, gained share. Information Management, up 3%. So if you look across that base of business, we had very strong performance across the board. I thought they did a very nice job in transitioning from the third quarter and as we looked at 2013, we think we ought to be looking at revenue growth in the mid-single-digits and very strong profit performance once again.
Operator
The next question comes from Shaw Wu with Sterne, Agee. You may ask your question.
Shaw Wu – Sterne, Agee & Leach
Hi. When you look at the previous product cycle with Power7, you had approximately – basically lasted about 18 months. What do you see with Power7 Plus? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
Well, I think we'll get a pretty strong product cycle out of it. As I had said earlier, the characteristic that I would focus on here is the couple of quarters it takes to get the volumes shipped, but we think we should have a very strong set of offerings with strength building as we go through the year. As I said, in the marketplace, it's performing quite well on a competitive basis.
Operator
The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Mark Moskowitz – JPMorgan
Good afternoon. Mark, I had a question. As we think about 2013, you've done a great job in terms of optimizing the operating margin profile. How should we think about the various rates contribution for 2013 in terms of incremental contribution to margin in terms of A, is it going to really from a mix driven up to Software? Or B, is it going to be an increasing level of optimization of Software and less labor in Services? Or C, will it be more about just OpEx reductions in general?
Mark Loughridge
If you look at the overall performance basis, it's really those two very strong plays that we’re driving through the model, both with good results in 2012 and we think we'll present good results in 2013 as well. First of all being the ongoing mix in the higher value, higher margin spaces. Again, the best example of that would be the tremendous progress I think we've made on our Software business. Again, I gave earlier the statistic, but I think it's kind of remarkable that in 2000 we were doing $2.4 billion. Last year we did $11 billion. So that ongoing mix to Software we think should continue. And then supplementing that will be all the work that we have ongoing in that $8 billion of focus spend that we talked about in our globally integrated enterprise initiative.
Now, one point I want to make clear in that $8 billion, we do work to drive about 40% of that to the bottom line, but the other 60% is firmly dedicated to remixing our spend profile and our resources. So there is higher growth, higher margin initiatives like Business Analytics, Smarter Planet, Cloud computing and if you look at the business mix within those, about 50% of the revenue mix within those initiatives is Software. So, much higher Software mix that we see in the base business. That too should help propel our mix into higher margin content.

The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
Keith Bachman – BMO Capital Markets
Thank you. Mark, you previously spoke to you thought Software would have mid-single digits as you look at calendar year '13. I want to see if you could specifically address then the services and the systems part of the business. I think to Tony's question you said you thought GBS would have positive revenue growth, but I didn't hear a GTS number. So if you could speak to both the services element if you think in constant currency dollars whether that will have positive revenue growth in any metrics and then the same question for the hardware system side please.
Mark Loughridge
Okay. Let's – I think the best framework I can give you on the services side – and I’m not going to walk through each of these elements, but on the services side, we built that view of backlog run-out in the presentation and that covers about 70% of the revenue that we realize in a year. So another way to look at it, we already have 70% of revenue as we enter the year. But in that, the math would say, it's up 1%, but the point I was making, as we are more explicit about the dynamics, is really from a profit standpoint it should perform more like a business that has a backlog run out of closer to 2%. Now, the dynamics underneath that, just given the backlog growth that we have had in our GBS business should move GBS into positive revenue performance as we go through the year.But I think the more important aspect of that is that revenue performance, that better mix of contract profile within the business, closing out on those $3 billion of deals that were rolled across the dateline, that should generate model level profit performance at our services business and as I said earlier, we would think it would drive kind of double-digit profit as going to the first quarter.From a hardware standpoint as we go into 2013, that first half is really going to be defined by the Z Series momentum that we have going and we would expect that that would help us drive double-digit profit in the first half as well. And on the software base of business, with key branded middleware at 6% in the fourth quarter we'd expect, as we had said earlier, mid-single digit revenue performance and a very strong profit contribution as well. So, all those things put together give us confidence in the at least $16.70 of earnings per share that we pointed out for the year.OperatorThe last question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.Chris Whitmore - Deutsche BankJust to follow up on Keith's question. I believe in earlier comments you've indicated earnings will be a little bit more front half loaded than second half loaded. Can you talk through the dynamics that would drive that type of unusual seasonality in 2013?Mark Loughridge
Yeah, absolutely. So when you look at the seasonality -- and here I'd make a couple of comments. First of all, the year-to-year performance across the quarters is relatively similar but will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. And that's really driven by kind of Z Series content and the Z Series dynamic. Remember, by the time we get to fourth quarter of next year we'll be facing the big announcement in the rearview mirror. So, I do expect that the first half of the year should be better growth than we see in the second half but we still expect to have a good second half.Now, within the first quarter the additional comment I would make, is really we'd kind of expect to see a little better performance in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and that comes down to Easter. This year, Easter falls in that last week of March and we've seen that in, especially in countries where Easter is a major holiday, that tends to move that business because you just have more difficulty getting hold of your clients and your customer base at the end of the quarter, and those contracts will generally roll to April. So, once again, a little stronger performance in the first half than the second half but a good second half at that. And within the first half, a little more strength in the second quarter than we would see in the first quarter based on the calendar date for Easter.So with that, let me take the opportunity to wrap up the call. Our 2012 results demonstrate the flexibility of IBM's business model. We had strong performance in our growth initiatives, especially in our higher value areas. We expanded our margins and had excellent profit growth which drove our 10th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. And we generated over $18 billion of free cash flow which is up $1.6 billion year-to-year and a record for IBM.So in 2013 we will continue to move our business forward, shifting to higher value and improving efficiency. We're going to buy businesses, we're going to sell business, we're going to rebalance our resources, align those to opportunities and continue to invest in innovation. Now, all of this is captured in our view of 2013. We are confident in our ability to deliver at least $16.70 for the year on our way to our objective of at least $20 in 2015. So, thank you again for joining us today and now as always it's back to work.OperatorThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark Loughridge.
Mark Loughridge
In the third quarter, we reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and increased operating earnings per share by 10% to $3.62. For the year, we're maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10, that's up 12% over last year.
Looking at our third quarter revenue by geography, Europe was fairly consistent with last quarter, Japan's revenues stabilized, the BRIC countries in total performed well again, but North America declined. When I look at our skew of business in the quarter, through the first two months, our revenue was fairly consistent with our second quarter performance. The third month of the quarter was more challenging. This quarter we delivered double digit operating earnings per share growth driven by our strength in our solutions offerings, a solid annuity base and our ongoing work on productivity.
First, we continue to drive very good results in our solutions offerings across software and services that address key demand areas like Smarter Planet, business analytics and cloud. Second, our annuity businesses which represent about half of our annual revenue and 60% of our profit provided a solid base of revenue and profit.
And third, we're continuing to execute on our productivity initiatives on track to deliver $8 billion of productivity over the 2015 roadmap. The benefit from these initiatives together with our mix to more profitable businesses helped to drive our margin expansion. Now before I get into the financial metrics, I want to remind you that this quarter we closed the sale of our Retail Store Solutions point-of-sales business to Toshiba TEC in most countries. The transaction results in a loss of revenue in profit for the divested operations, a gain on the sale and an impact to our tax rate. As we go through the presentation, I will clarify the impact of each of these.
In the quarter IBM's revenue was down 5% including a currency headwind of nearly 4 points. At constant currency we were down 2% or down 1% if you normalize for the RSS divestitures. But in spite of this revenue decline we had solid operating profit growth with pretax income up 7% and net income up 5%. Our margin expansion was driven by our productivity initiatives, improving business mix and the overall currency dynamics.
This quarter we expanded operating gross margin by 1.2 points with about 60% due to improvements in margins and the balance from mix. With good expense management we improved operating PTI margin by 2.5 points. This quarter our tax rate was up over 1 point year-to-year. The increase was driven by a higher tax rate on the gain from the sale of our RSS business. We now expect an operating effective tax rate excluding one-time items in the range of 24.5% for the year.
Bottom-line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.62 which was up 10% year-to-year. When you look at the year-to-year drivers of our operating EPS performance the 5% decline in revenue at constant margin impacted profit growth by $0.17 per share. Margin expansion was the largest contributor to our growth. Within that, the gain on the RSS divestiture contributed $0.23, gross margin expansion added $0.19 and our expense productivity another $0.16. On the other hand, we did have an increase in our workforce rebalancing activity for an impact of $0.24.
Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed the balance at a level fairly consistent with the first two quarters of the year. As you can see the dynamics are very similar to first half performance. Now I will get into the third quarter details starting with revenue by geography where I'll discuss the results on a constant currency basis.
America's revenue was down 3% with declines in both the U.S. and Canada. In North America, software was up 4%, services was down and we had a double digit decline in hardware. With revenue performance relatively consistent with last quarter, EMEA was stable. Looking at the performance by country, Germany and Spain grew; the U.K. was flat, while France and Italy declined.
Turning to Asia Pacific last quarter, I said that I expected our business in Japan to stabilize. This quarter our revenue in Japan was flat year-to-year, so certainly an improvement over the last several quarters. We had good performance in both Europe and Japan given the environment, and our growth market countries, which we refer to as GMU, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%.
We had double digit growth in Russia, which was up 11%, India up 13% and China up 19%. Brazil, however, was down 3%. Looking beyond the BRICs, Australia and Mexico were down double digits this quarter, while most of the other countries continued to do well. In fact, this quarter 35 of the growth market countries grew at a double digit rate, reflecting ongoing broad-based strength. Looking at IBM revenue and gross margin by segment, our total services revenue was flat as modest revenue growth from our backlog was offset by impacts from shorter-term and volume related activity.
Software performance is driven by double digit growth across our solutions area like business analytics, commerce and social business. Our Systems and Technology revenue declined each month though performance in September improved as we introduced our Next Generation System Z.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margins improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative performance of software.
Now, let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 10%. The primary driver was currency which drove 8 points from both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 3 points of expense growth, so consequently our base expense was better by 5 points.
Now I'll comment on a few expense items. SG&A includes a pretax charge of over $400 million for workforce rebalancing activity which at IBM's average tax rate impacted net income by about $310 million. Other income and expense had two drivers; first, of pretax gain for the sale of a Retail Store Solutions business, and second, we had a year-to-year impact from our hedging activity. The pretax gain for the RSS sale is almost $450 million with a discrete tax rate on that gain based on the countries closed the transaction contributed about $280 million of net income.
Turning to the hedging activity, we hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in our global cash planning. Last year hedging programs generated losses resulting in an impact to expense of about $175 million, while this year the programs generated gains of about $100 million in expense. Roughly 90% of our hedging activity this quarter was in expense, the balance is in cost. As you know, this hedging activity can't be looked at in isolation, as it mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.
Looking at how all of this translates into pretax margins by segment, we've provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics by removing the workforce rebalancing charges in both years to give you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segments. On this basis, you can see good profit growth and margin expansion in Global Technology Services, Global Business Services and Software.
Now let's turn to the segments starting with services. The two services segments delivered $14.5 billion in revenue and excluding workforce rebalancing charges grew pretax profit 9% and expanded pretax margins by just over 2 points. Backlog was $138 billion up 1% year-to-year. We continue to see strong performance in the growth markets with backlog up 15% at constant currency and globally transactional backlog was up 7% at constant currency.
Turning to the two segments, in Global Technology Services revenue was $9.9 billion down 4% as reported and up 1% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was flat at constant currency. As we have previously discussed there are three primary sources of revenue in outsourcing. First, revenue from backlog, which makes up the majority of the revenue in the year. Second, revenue from new client signings within the year; and finally, revenue from base growth, which comes from new business sold into the existing accounts and from volumes generated within the quarter.
This quarter we continue to get revenue growth from our backlog. However, we did see a decline in revenue from base growth after growing through the first half. Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 3% at constant currency with the growth markets up 13% at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered flat pretax profit growth in the quarter though excluding workforce rebalancing charges pretax profit was up 9% with 2 points of margin expansion.
This quarter there are a number of drivers of margin expansion. First, increased contribution from the growth markets, which continue to drive higher gross margins than our major markets; second, lift from our continued focus on automation and process primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives and finally, we continue to benefit from the work GTS has done to improve performance in a select set of lower margin contracts within strategic outsourcing.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, down 6% as reported or down 3% at constant currency. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to drive the strongest performance. Japan returned to growth this quarter with revenue up 2% at constant currency while North America and Europe are both down 6% at constant currency.
Looking at the GBS business by offering, the growth initiatives continued to drive strong growth. We had solid double digit growth in business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. Together these initiatives represent about a third of total GBS revenue. So, we continue to get great traction in these growth initiatives and we're seeing the benefits across IBM. The overall growth rate of GBS is being impacted by declines in some of the more traditional package application projects.
Turning to profit, GBS pretax income declined 5% year-to-year. However, when adjusting for workforce rebalancing, pretax income grew 9% and pretax margin expanded 2.5 points. Margin expansion benefited from prior year quarters workforce rebalancing, yield from enterprise productivity initiatives and a help from currency.
Software revenue of $5.8 billion is down 1% and up 3% at constant currency. Through August, revenue was up 5% at constant currency. However, performance in September was weak particularly in North America and the growth markets. Our portfolio of solutions offerings was up double digits year-to-year while the complementary infrastructure portfolio was essentially flat.
Now, let me take you through the drivers for the brands. WebSphere grew 5% at constant currency and continue to extend its market-leading position. We had good growth from our commerce offerings which target not only the CIO, but also the CMO, so we're reaching new buyers. This performance was bolstered our recent acquisitions of Tealeaf which enables clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices.
Information management was up 3% at constant currency. Performance was driven by strong growth in our business analytics offerings, led by Algorithmics which together with our deep analytics expertise helps our clients manage risk and better enable faster decision-making. Just last week Software announced new members of PureSystems family, the IBM PureData Systems. These expert integrated systems are optimized to deliver high-performance data services for transactional and analytics applications.
Tivoli software was up 9% at constant currency and gained share. Revenue from our storage portfolio was up 14% at constant currency reflecting the value of stored software. Tivoli Security was up 9% at constant currency driven by Q1 Labs which provides next-generation security intelligence. Lotus declined 7% at constant currency in the quarter although Notes declined we had strong performance in our social business offerings.
In the third quarter we announced the acquisition of Kenexa which further expand our solution portfolio for social business. We expect Kenexa to close late in the fourth quarter. Software pretax income was $2.4 billion, up 6% from last year. Normalized for the high level of workforce rebalancing, software pretax income was up 10% and pretax margin expanded 3.5 points. Systems and Technology delivered revenue of $3.9 billion down 13%. Adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store Solutions, revenue was down 11% or 9% at constant currency.
System Z revenue declined 19% at constant currency and MIPS declined 2%. Late in the third quarter we started shipping the zEnterprise EC12 server which delivers up to 25% improved application performance and up to 50% enhanced capacity making it the fastest and most capable enterprise system to-date. This new mainframe will be ramping through the fourth quarter.
Power revenue was down 1% at constant currency. We had strength again this quarter in Power high-performance computing solutions. We continued our success in competitive take outs. This quarter we had over 260 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business which came almost equally from HP and Oracle Sun. This initiative helped drive our 18th consecutive quarter of share gains in Power.
Early in October we announced a new POWER7 plus based servers. These new systems offer performance boosts of 30% to 40% compared to prior versions and new capabilities for cloud and security. System x revenue was down 3% at constant currency. Our storage hardware revenue was down 8% at constant currency, while storage software which is reported in Tivoli was up 14% at constant currency. We continue to see value shifting to software. Earlier this month, we announced the new high-end DS8070, which enables clients to take full advantage of the increased performance, in our new high-end enterprise servers. We are expanding our storage software capabilities as well. Last week we announced the Virtual Storage Center, which integrates multiple software solutions that deliver fast backup and restore in a virtualized storage environment.
As you look to the fourth quarter we have significantly enhanced our systems portfolio with our new zEnterprise EC12 mainframe, Power systems based on the new POWER7 plus architecture and new storage systems including the high-end DS8870.
Across all of our segments, we're continuing the strong performance in our key growth initiatives. In the growth markets, we're expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and focusing on targeted industries. For the year, revenue was up 7% at constant currency and we have gained share. Our Business Analytics Solutions help our clients to identify, manage and predict outcomes by leveraging huge amounts of data. Our broad portfolio of Analytics Solutions was up 14% in the third quarter, led by our GBS consulting practice.
Our SmartCloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements with strong growth across the offerings from private cloud to public cloud to our industry-based solutions. Cloud revenue so far this year has already exceeded our full year revenue for 2011. All of this comes together in our Smarter Planet Solutions. Through the third quarter, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, with traction and our smarter commerce and industry solutions. When you look at our offerings in our Business Analytics, Cloud and Smarter Planet about half of the revenue was software. So, the success we're having in these areas is improving our business mix and our margin.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Now, let me walk through the year-to-year drivers. Our operating net income was up $200 million year-to-year and GAAP income is flat. One of the non-operating items this quarter is a charge for U.K. pension. On October 12th, the U.K. Court issued a ruling regarding an IBM U.K. pension plan. We took a pretax charge of approximately $160 million or $125 million after tax, though the charge impacted GAAP net income, it did not impact operating income and since it's a non-cash item, it's reversed in a free cash flow analysis.
Looking at the items that impacted cash year-to-year, our cash tax payments increased $300 million. We had an increase of almost $100 million for our workforce rebalancing payments and our capital expenditures were also up year-to-year. So, though operating profit was up $200 million, free cash flow was down almost $350 million based on increased tax capital and restructuring payments. Through the first three quarters of the year our free cash flow was up $1 billion year-to-year to $8.7 billion. Our growth in net income was partially offset with increased capital investments. As I mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity.
Looking at the uses of our cash through September, we spent $2.3 billion to acquire 10 companies including Texas Memory Systems which closed in the third quarter. We returned almost $12 billion to shareholders this year. We paid out over $2.8 billion in dividends and spent $9 billion in share repurchase to buyback almost 46 million shares. At end of the third quarter, we had $6.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 million. Total debt was $33.7 billion of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at just over 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $10.3 billion and our non-financing debt to cap was 36% consistent with June.
We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long-term. Wrapping up our discussion on the quarter, we delivered 10% operating EPS growth and $3.1 billion in free cash flow. Within our operations, we had solid contribution from our annuity businesses and strong performance in our growth initiatives, Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and Cloud. Our productivity initiatives helped to drive margin expansion and our solid balance sheet and cash generation supported shareholder returns.
As we move into the fourth quarter we have new product introductions in our Systems portfolio not just in System Z but also in Power and storage. We have just announced PureSystems offerings that leverage our software capabilities and late in the quarter we expect to close the acquisition of Kenexa. Taking all of this into account we are maintaining our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS of at least $15.10. This keeps us on track to at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I ask you to refrain from multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session 

Operator
(Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Toni Sacconagh with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconagh - Sanford Bernstein
I was wondering, if you could provide some color, commentary around the quarter. Relative to your expectations revenues were short, your tone I think sounded a bit more cautious and you made several references to the U.S. being weaker and the third month of the quarter being more challenging. So specifically on those latter two points, can you help us understand what you think happened? Is this being driven by macroeconomic issues? Are these IBM execution issues and if we look forward, are you expecting either the execution of the macro issues to reverse or improve in the fourth quarter?
Mark Loughridge
So, if you look at the third quarter performance, we did start off the first two months to the quarter on a stronger trajectory than we saw for the full quarter as we saw a fall-off in our growth rates in the third month of the quarter. Now, within that, third month phenomena, I would point to look at it from a brand perspective that was really a fall-off that we saw in our GBS business, number one, and our software business, number two, and from a geographic perspective, it was really a fall-off that we saw in North America and our growth markets unit which we refer to as GMU.
Now, elementally, as you walk down those, the software content, I would attribute to a handful of deals that fell out of the quarter. Frankly, we thought we had those, right through the end of the quarter. They rolled to the fourth quarter. They would have accounted for about 2 points improved performance, which would have been more consistent with what we saw in the first two months of the quarter and those software deals were also part of the GMU performance.
So, just as a software business would have performed better in the quarter, with the rollover of that handful of deals so would our GMU performance. Now, as you look at our growth market performance, in addition, they were impacted really by a couple of very large countries that had disappointing performance on a year-to-year basis. So, that would be Mexico and Australia. They are both down double digit. Our BRIC countries as a whole were up 11% and within that plus 11% positive performance very consistent what we've seen historically. Brazil was in fact down 3% but on the other countries Russia was up 11%, India was up 13% and China was up very strong 19%.
Now let's look at the countries in GMU, outside of the BRIC countries. Again if we exclude Australia and Mexico, where we had the double digit decline, the balance of the countries outside of BRIC grew double digit, in fact we had 35 countries with double digit performance. So, I would not attribute some broader trend to either of those perspectives. In our GBS business, GBS once again produced very strong results on a solutions base, but we did have a more challenging environment for the more traditional packet solutions. The other solution content is linked to our key growth initiatives, so it's very important that we do well there. So, now if you take that data forward in the fourth quarter, I think on the software business and the hardware business outside of the impact of the Retail Store Systems divestiture, we should be seeing mid-single digit performance from both of them and driving double digit profitability. I think our services business will have a revenue base similar to what we saw in the third quarter, but let me add you know the services profitability that they each drove at 9% growth was right in midpoint of their model performance, and with that as well as the new announcement content that we're getting out of our hardware business, we have new z. We have a new POWER7 plus entry in our high end of our P Series. We have got new storage content. We feel quite confidence in the at least $0.15 for the year.
Patricia Murphy

Thanks Toni can we go to the next question please.

Operator
The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays
Mark you talked a bit about what could get better in the fourth quarter in terms of revenue. I believe you said the hardware and software revenue growth rates. Can talk about what could get better in the fourth quarter and even next year in costs? You had a very larger well put in perspective, your workforce rebalancing for us and what costs levers you have going into the fourth quarter and beyond please?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. I think the overall opportunity we have in costs really goes back fundamentally to the business model and how we drive that business model over longer periods of time. The workforce rebalancing that we have done this year in total that was about $800 million predominantly outside the U.S. and should have a payback of about 15 months.
Now we are constantly driving workforce rebalancing to tune our population to the best growth opportunities that we have. If you look at the overall cost and spending improvement that we saw in the third quarter, the first point I would make is that, in a period of currency headwind that impact that that has in the overall translational effect of currency that's mitigated and partially offset obviously by the hedge.
You could kind of see that in the margin performance in our business. Our gross profit margins were up 1.2 points while our PTI was up 2.5 points and that differential a large part of that is the offset of the hedge helping to offset the impact that we saw on the revenue line and this flow through to gross profit margin. The 1.2 points we add in gross profit that had a very solid mix component, about 0.4 points from mix and a very solid spend component, and I think both of those are strong ongoing plays that we should leverage as we go into the fourth quarter and 2013. 
That mix component is predominantly the mix that we see in the software that we've been driving for a decade and the spend efficiencies are part of that overall $8 billion plan that we have for 2015 roadmap. Obviously, to break that down by year, its $1.6 billion by quarter is about $400 million if we get 30% to 40% to the bottom line, that's an advantage about $150 million. The balance, I'd remind you, that really goes to making our offerings and our products more competitive. On a price basis, it gives the ability to move spend to more aggressive growth opportunities.
Patricia Murphy 

Thank you Ben can we please go to the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steve Milunovich - UBS
Given that the number of month weakness, could you talk a bit more about what customers are telling you in terms of the fourth quarter, I have seen some CIOs. There is some concern about not just the election, but fiscal cliff and questioning whether we're going to see the normal budget flush. Maybe you could tie into that, what you're seeing in verticals. It looks like finance in public slowed a bit, but it actually held in relatively well, so do you think there is much downside risk going forward?
Mark Loughridge
I got to admit this was cutting out a little bit, but I heard the substance to your question. So, let me answer that. I think as I'm not going to kind of comment on the environment as if I were an economist but I can you tell the facts that we saw in the substance of the business will take time to describe so far.
When you look at the overall issue of a fiscal cliff and a budget flush, I got to be honest, Steve, I kind of react to the position because I don't think it will be responsible kind of a performance for either public or private sector. I mean if we have spending requirements, I don't think people would rollout and maximize their spend rate this budget period to the expense of the overall spend requirements. I know if it was in my business and one of my controllers, the CFO was 'driving a budget flush' I'd be driving them out of the business. So, certainly the controllers that I have met in government, they are very responsible, they are driving to do exactly the right thing and if they see spending pressure, they are doing their work to help respond to that. To me, on a global basis, we look around the world, governments are under pressure.
The spending is under pressure. I don't think this is news to anybody, but I think Steve from my perspective when you look at this proposition that there will be a budget flush to me as I had said earlier, I kind of react to that because it implies I think that they wouldn't be responding to the base economic challenges they have and I don't think that's the case.

The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus
Mark, I'm wondering, I'm not sure if I heard you right, but I though you said that the outsourcing and the transactional backlog were up this quarter on a constant currency basis. Can you help us reconcile that with the continued loss of revenue momentum within the services unit?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. If you look at the overall backlog, our total backlog for the quarter was up 1% within that our outsourcing backlog was relatively flat. Our transactional backlog if you just do the math was up 7% now. There are some dynamics that are pretty compelling within that. So, when you look at that outsourcing backlog and you break that down by unit you see much more momentum in our growth markets. So, if you take the total backlog for the business and break that down between major markets and growth markets the backlog in our growth markets is up 15% and that's kind of an ongoing momentum that we have seen in our services business in the growth markets.
If you break this then down by unit, on the GTS base of business, I think they had a pretty good quarter there and actually the GTS business is up more than 1% as we enter the fourth quarter. I would also analyze the revenue performance in the quarter and remind you that we did take this very specific set of actions on the weak tail of the profitability distribution of our contracts and as we took that action on the weak tail that enhances and improves overall profitability. You saw it in the first nine months of the year of this year with the strong performance that we got out of the GTS business but it does have an impact on the other side to revenue. We knew that and we made that trade-off because our objective is to drive real gross profit and real profitability in those contracts in the backlog. It's not that hard to go through the services business and drive big signings but you have to live with that decision for a number of years in relationship with your customer. Our objective is to establish a strong relationship right up front with a profitable set of contracts that we know we can deliver over the longer term. So, I think I would caution you from looking at that GTS business, you got to recognize there was some revenue impact as we optimized to profitability.

Thanks Mark. Let’s go to the next question.

Your next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs
I have a question on the services segment as well. We're obviously seeing a pretty big dislocation in restructuring effort at one of your largest services competitors and more than we've certainly seen in a while in this sector. Is that having any noticeable impact on the competitive landscape, in outsourcing in particular, are you expecting to see any competitive tailwind as we go into 2013?
Mark Loughridge
Well, I do think as we look at the capability that we're able to put on the field, we've got a pretty strong hand of very disciplined and experienced managers and executives, employees in the services business and I got to say the services business is not like the software business. It's not like the hardware business. It is a specific skillset. So, to the point that there is an impact on one of our competitor's profile that certainly should provide us opportunity, but when you look at the kind of broader trends that I think are more significant. I think you got to look at the opportunity we're seeing in the growth markets. Again, when we look at an opportunity set in growth markets, where we have about 20% of our backlog to be up 15% that's a pretty strong statement at very strong levels of profitability where we want to see where we can really put talent on the field, differentiated from our competition, there are lot of examples in the growth markets.

Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan 
When I come to Software business for a second here if we could, I know IBM has been pretty active hiring a lot more sales force individuals that capacity, does that have any impact on business in terms of visibility or some of these deal push-outs related to the piece on the sales force?
Mark Loughridge
No, I mean, as we hire, we're going to continue hiring as we go through the fourth quarter. We take that resource and we train it and make it more productive and drive it into your overall sales organization, now that period of bringing that sales resource up to speed takes some time, but underneath that if you look at our Software business, the solutions contents underneath it had a very strong quarter, up double digit once again and the solutions contents is both organically generated as well as the implementation of the integration with our acquisition profile and that's been very strong across the portfolio of offerings. It was a little more challenging and new to performance on the infrastructure side, but as we look at the fourth quarter. I think we have opportunities across both and so again adjusting for that handful of deals in Software that fell out of a quarter, we were seeing performance more consistent with what we saw in the first two months of the quarter and I think we have the opportunity to close those deals and get back on a stronger trajectory as we go into the fourth quarter. So I think we have got a good software play here and I would look for them to generate mid-single-digit revenue growth in Q4.
Patricia Murphy

The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal
I wanted to ask you about GBS in particular and how you think growth can proceed as we look out and the context of the question is GBS on a constant currency basis has been down 1% each of the first two quarters, was down 3% this quarter on frankly an easier compare. You mentioned that Japan had stabilized, which is usually a positive impact on GBS. So it continues to disappoint. How does growth improve? What causes improve? Or is this the right kind of run rate for GBS as we look out over the next few quarters?
Mark Loughridge
I don't disagree with your comments. I can provide more of a background. Do think we certainly do have the opportunity to improve. I think the business did what we said we're going to drive in Japan. We did stabilize our business in Japan. I think the team in Japan did a nice job. What we really wrestled with a little here was the challenge that we had in those more traditional packet solutions and they were generally kind of third-party offerings and HR supply chain or ERP. On the flipside of the coin though we did a great job in GBS on those key growth initiatives and the solutions attached to those. So on one hand I would have liked to have seen, I know the team would have liked to seen, better performance in those traditional packet areas and we're going to be rebuilding capability as we go in the fourth quarter and 2013. But I thought they did a very nice job on the solutions business, which is so important because its cuts across our business profile into hardware, software and services business. Let me remind you as you all know, those solutions drive about 50% mix in overall software business. So, we can do better as we work on that, traditional packet solutions. But I think they deserve a lot of credit for the work they have done on the solutions business.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Keith. Can we go to the next question please.

The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley 
Can you talk a little bit more about what you expect out of the recently announced server and storage product, specifically are you looking for growth across all the server products in the fourth quarter? Do you think growth can carry into next year and is there a structural shift towards better margins just given that your innovation seems to focus on the higher margin categories within there?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. I would break the new announcements into kind of three categories, the first two we are introducing the new high end POWER7 plus and I think that has a lot of key technology offerings. It's only part of the product line, however, but it is the high-end. So, we look at that as real margin opportunity within the mix of their product line. Likewise, in the storage business, we're announcing the new high-end content introducing POWER7 to our architecture and we think that likely has real opportunity in the high-end for not just revenue, but margin contribution within their product line.
But clearly the big announcement for the quarter is the new z Series and as we look at the new z Series, now we have a full quarter of opportunity. In the third quarter, we're really only shipping the new z for about 11 days in the very backend of the quarter and in front of that, ship date, we only had about three weeks of selling time, so now is the opportunity for full quarters work, and as I look at it, I think they have a very strong case on a Hardware basis for the new z platform to generate 20% to 30% growth.
So, within all that, that gives us confidence within our objectives that the hardware base of business are to be generating about 5% revenue growth, our of the impact of divestiture of the Retail Store Systems content. Now that divestment has about a 4 point impact to the hardware base of business and about 1 point impact to IBM. But I think we do have good hand on that content and will see it improve the overall hardware performance not just in North America but as we go through the global rollout as well.
Patricia Murphy 
Thanks Katy. Let’s go to the next question please.

The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may ask your question.
Jim Suva - Citigroup
The question I have is on your bookings, they were up very meaningfully here at 8% year-over-year, the constant current up 11%. As you look into that, just curious if there is anything in that number that was one-off that was something it maybe slipped in from Q2 last quarter or pulled in from Q4, any special big one-time special booking and any changes of durations, just that we should be aware of?
Mark Loughridge
No I think that was capitalizing on the opportunities with the advantages that we can bring to the marketplace again. If you look at the backlog contents and I think that's the best metric to use here while backlog was up 1% overall it was up 15% in our growth markets. If you look at the components of total backlog between outsourcing and transactional, outsourcing is relatively flat while transactional is up 7%. I would not say there were some kind of very neat contracts that were inconsistent with our overall rollout contributed to that. I think one of the very powerful trends that we do see is how well our content and our capability plays in new opportunities as we look at growth markets. I think that's the more substantial trend line we see here.
Patricia Murphy 
Operator let’s take one more question please.
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank 
I wanted to come back to services margins one more time if I could. What I'm really trying to understand here is the dynamic between the pruning of some unprofitable contracts, is that nearing completion? Is there more room to the deal on the pruning side? Then secondarily most of the workforce rebalancing efforts targeted at driving services margins and if so can you frame a medium-term margin target for the services business there in 2013? Do you expect margins to improve further from these levels?
Mark Loughridge
Yes. So let's look at the overall margin dynamics for the Corporation. When you look at it we are driving that very focused piece of work that Linda Sanford took you through at the Analyst Meeting to generate about $8 billion of spend take-out across the business and as I'd said earlier if you just kind of mathematically break it down to about $1.6 billion a year or $400 million a quarter that content is in some respects outside of the business unit purview and it gets applied to those business units based on their kind of metrics in participation. So in other words if we take big spend rate out of the back office support organizations. The business units are the beneficiary of that spend take-out but they didn't have to drive a lot of the content since we manage on a globally integrated enterprise.
That's a very structured play that we are driving not only across our back-office content but now into systematic areas that span across our processes and also spend rates within business units that collectively have more opportunities. So, we intend to continue that overall spend dynamic and as I had said earlier our services business will certainly be a beneficiary there. Now in your question about the overall workforce rebalancing that we do just given the fact that the services business have the largest share of our overall population of course they are going to be the beneficiary of that as well. But to me on the longer-term basis, I think that the model base that we provided as part of the 2015 roadmap is the best criteria, the best content that you can see as you look at that long-term run rate. So if you look at how we would attempt to implement those as we go into 2013.
I mean believe me, this team is going to look at the actuals that we drive in 2012, we are going to draw a plum line to that 2015 objective and then we are going to base our profitability, our free cash flow all of those content in our budgets to support it as well as our compensation. So that's how we will be driving that.
So let me just take a moment now to wrap up the call. Despite facing challenges we did deliver a 7% growth in profit, 10% growth in our operating EPS and I think consistent with the last conversation that performance reflects our disciplined approach to delivering profit growth. For the quarter we had 10% growth in our software profit, 9% from our services businesses, both of which benefit from a large annuity base. We are continuing to move up the value chain shifting our portfolio to more strategic areas. Now we had continued momentum in our growth initiatives both Smarter Planet, Business Analytics as well as our Cloud, were all up strong double digits and this quarter we completed the divestiture of our retail store solutions business.
The benefits from our ongoing work on productivity showed through to our margin and we are returning value to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. So looking forward as we enter the fourth quarter, as always we need to execute and we need the growth market for the software to close those rollover deals that we discussed and then drive an improved trajectory in the fourth quarter. We need GBS to drive more of that traditional packet transactions content while maintaining the good momentum they have shown in our growth initiatives.
I think North America needs to capitalize on the great hardware product lineup we have for the fourth quarter with the new z, the new p and storage to drive transactional sales performance in the fourth quarter. So based on this we are confident in our plans to achieve at least $15.10 of operating EPS for the year. That's up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015. So once again thanks for joining us and now as always it's back to work.

Now, I’ll turn the call over to Mark Loughridge.

Mark Loughridge
Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter we reported $25.8 billion in revenue, expanded gross, pre-tax, and net operating margins, and delivered operating earnings per share of $3.51, up 14% year to year, and generated free cash flow of $3.7 billion, up 9%.
So when you look at it, our results demonstrate the strength of IBM’s business model, which is designed to deliver profiting cash on a sustainable basis. Consistent with this performance, we're increasing our full-year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10. This is up $0.10 from our previous view of at least $15.
I will comment on a couple of the second quarter highlights by segment. In software, we had mid-single digits constant currency growth in Europe and Japan, double-digit growth in the growth markets, while the U.S. growth was lower due to very stronger performance a year ago.
Services growth of constant currency was consistent with last quarter, with our annuity content providing a solid base of revenue on profit. Our backlog was flat year to year at constant currency, and we again expanded margins and grew our combined services segment profit by 18%.
Our hardware business declined as you would expect at this point in our product cycles though we continue to extend our share leadership in our two high-end server brands. In total IBM’s revenue growth at constant currency was fairly consistent with the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a currency headwind, but it got even tougher over the last 90 days, when you look at the reported revenue, currency impacted our revenue growth by almost 4 points or a $1 billion of revenue. But despite of this headwind we generated strong operating profit performance, with pretax and net income each of 8%.
Now an important element of our long-term model is to expand margin through a combination of productivity and mix to higher margin businesses. This quarter, we expanded operating gross margin by 1.5 with two-thirds due to improvement in segment margins and the other third from mix. We improved operating PTI margins by more than 2 points and operating net margin by 1.6 points, so this quarter again we demonstrated the flexibility in our model. Bottom-line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.51, which was up 14% year-to-year.
Turning to cash, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, that's up 9% slightly faster than net income, when you consider the last 12 months we’ve generated a record $18 billion of free cash flow. With this strong cash performance, we delivered significant returns to shareholders with $4 billion in share repurchases and dividends this quarter, and nearly $17 billion over the last 12 months.
Now I'll get into the second quarter details, starting with revenue by geography, where I’ll discuss the results on a constant currency basis. In the Americas, Canada was up, while the U.S. again was flat year-to-year. EMEA was also flat year-to-year slowing just a point from last quarter’s growth rate, but in total still relatively stable as in the past there is a good bit of variability by country. We had growth again in the U.K. and Spain, Germany was flat, while France and Italy declined.
Overall revenue on our major market countries was down 1% year-to-year. With 8% growth, our growth markets rate outpaced the major markets by 9 points. Even with the tough compare the BRICs had another good quarter combined they were up 12%. We had particular strength in Russia and China. In fact China was up over 20% this quarter again gaining share.
We’re continuing to build our capabilities here. We’ve expanded the number of branch offices and now have 68 phase to phase and over 100 virtual branch offices open across all of China. Across the growth markets this quarter more than 30 countries grew at a double-digit growth rate.
So our strength is broad based. We’re capturing the opportunity from these faster growing economies and importantly we’re taking share due in part to the acceleration of our market expansion initiatives. In fact this is our eighth consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets. So now let me add a little color to our revenue on gross margin by segment.
For total services both outsourcing and transactional revenues were up 1% of constant currency and we're continuing to deliver strong growth in our growth market countries. In software this quarter, we had good growth in our business analytics and storage management offerings.
Our systems and technology revenue decline was roughly inline with our first quarter rate. This quarter we again put share on power driven by competitive displacements.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 1.5 points driven by a combination of solid margin expansion in both services segment and an improving segment mix due to the relative growth of software.
Now let’s take a look below the gross profit line to our expense in spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 6% this is driven by currency for both translation and hedging dynamics.
Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove two points of expense growth. And our base expense excluding currency and acquisitions was down one point. I will comment on a couple of expense items.
First, it wasn't a significant driver year-to-year; we had about $150 million of workforce were balancing in the quarter primarily in Europe. Second, we had the year-to-year benefit from our hedging programs, which as you know cannot be looked at in isolation, as it mitigates the translation impacts across the P&L. We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in our global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated fairly significant losses and impact or expense of $195 million, while this year the programs generated gains about $85 million in expense. This represents over three quarters of our hedging activity, the balance is in cost. This is the dynamic you would expect given the year-to-year change in currencies, but again this hedge activity mitigates translation impacts throughout the P&L.
So now let me go into the segments. The two services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pre-tax profit by 18% and expanded pre-tax margin by three points. Backlog was $136 billion, down 6% year-to-year at actual rates and flat at constant currency.
Overall, services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with last quarter. The growth markets were up 10% at constant currency with good backlog growth and the major markets were down 1% at constant currency. Within the major markets looking at revenue North America was stable, Japan was still down that we did see some improvement over the last quarter and Europe decelerated compared to last quarter. And we continued the strong performance in our business analytics, Cloud and Smarter Planet offerings.
Overall profit performance was very strong, with 24% growth in Global Technology Services pre-tax profit, and 7% growth in Global Business Services profit.
Moving on to the two segments, in Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, down 2% as reported, and up 2% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% at constant currency. Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 4% at constant currency, with the growth markets up nearly 16% at constant currency.
Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin, with pre-tax income up 24%, and pre-tax margin up 3.6 points. Last quarter, I commented on the tremendous amount of work that GTS has done to manage their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Specifically, by taking a disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts. This work continues to yield benefits in both profit and margin, and accounted for about one third of the gross margin expansion in GTS this quarter. Although there will be some modest impact to revenue from this work going forward, we should see ongoing benefits to the portfolio.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, down 4% as reported, and down 1% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration revenues were flat year-to-year at constant currency and Application Outsourcing revenues declined 1% at constant currency. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well, with their fifth consecutive quarter of 10% growth or better.
North America was relatively stable, while Japan was down. This quarter revenue in Europe decreased 3% at constant currency after being flat last quarter. Now looking at the growth initiatives, within GBS, we have been remixing and shifting more resources to these higher value growth initiatives. This quarter, GBS revenue included strong growth in Business Analytics, which was up 28%, and Smarter Planet, up 15%. But GBS’ value extends beyond what is reported in the GBS segment. They play a key role in driving the growth initiatives across IBM, where we are seeing continued strong performance. And finally, GBS returned to a more typical level of profitability, as we indicated on our last call. So this quarter, pre-tax income grew 7%, and pre-tax margin improved by 1.8 points.
Software revenue of $6.2 billion was flat as reported, and up 4% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware, which accounted for 64% of total software revenue in the second quarter, increased 4% at constant currency, in line with the market. Software performed well in the growth markets where revenue was up double digits, and Europe and Japan both grew at mid single digits, all in constant currency. Growth in the U.S. was impacted by a very tough compare. We see great opportunity in our global software business and are hiring 200 to 300 sales representatives each month through year end.
Now, let me take you through the drivers for a few of the brands. WebSphere
grew 7% at constant currency, and gained share for the 15th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had good growth in our Commerce and Portals offerings. This quarter we acquired Tealeaf, a provider of customer experience management software, which enables our clients to analyze interactions on websites and mobile devices.
Information Management was up 3% at constant currency and held share. Netezza continued to expand its global footprint, with very strong growth in Europe, Japan and growth markets, and added nearly 70 new clients worldwide. This quarter we closed two more acquisitions expanding our business analytics and optimization software capabilities: Varicent, an analytics software company that helps optimize sales performance management; and Vivisimo, which enhances IBM’s Big Data initiative by helping clients analyze volume, variety and velocity of Big Data for strategic advantage.
Tivoli software was up 6% at constant currency and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 13% at constant currency. Tivoli Storage Management continues to perform exceptionally well, growing double digits at constant currency for the sixth consecutive quarter.
Within our security offerings, we are utilizing recent acquisitions such as Q1Labs to provide end-to-end risk management solutions to protect our clients against the latest threats, while reducing the costs and complexity of security.
Turning to profit, Software pre-tax income grew 8% to $2.5 billion, and pre-tax margins increased 2.7 points to 35.9%. Systems & Technology revenue of $4.3 billion was down 9%, or 7% at constant currency, following very strong growth across the portfolio a year ago.
System z revenue declined 9% at constant currency, and MIPS declined 8% with a mix toward specialty engines. System z profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the upgrade cycle. Power revenue was down 4% at constant currency this quarter. We had continued strength this quarter in Power high performance computing solutions. In June, IBM achieved the top speed rating in the world, and we earned three of the top four spots on the TOP500 project, which ranks the world’s most powerful computers. We continued our success in competitive displacements in the second quarter, with over 320 displacements that drive over $265 million of business. As you would expect, these came from a combination of HP and Oracle/Sun. This initiative has helped drive our seventeenth consecutive quarter of share gains in Power. System x revenue was down 5% at constant currency. Our high-end segment grew double digits. Storage hardware revenue was flat at constant currency, with the value continuing to shift to software, as you saw with the ongoing success we’re having in our Tivoli storage software offerings.
In the second quarter, we introduced and began shipping PureFlex, the first offering from our new PureSystems family of expert integrated systems. PureFlex optimizes workloads and drives hardware efficiencies. In the third quarter, the PureApplication system will become available and we expect volume shipments in the fourth quarter. PureApplication will do for software, what PureFlex does for hardware, by driving application efficiency and rapid deployment, to enable faster time to value.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $300 million year to year. Over the last 12 months, we generated a record $18 billion in free cash flow. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $5.5 billion was up $1.4 billion year-to-year. The growth was driven by net income. As I’ve mentioned previously, in the first quarter of last year our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity. But even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow.
Looking at the uses of our cash in the first half, we spent almost $2 billion to acquire eight companies, including Vivisimo, Varicent and Tealeaf which closed in the second quarter. We returned almost $8 billion to the shareholders in the first half. We spent $6 billion in share repurchase to buyback almost 31 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, we had $9.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. We took our dividend up 13% in April, and through June we paid out $1.8 billion. This is the 17th consecutive year that we raised our dividend, and the ninth year in a row of double-digit increases.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.2 billion. Total debt was $32.4 billion of which $22.6 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $9.8 billion, and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 36%. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Once again, margin expansion was the largest contributor to growth, as our continued focus on productivity and mix to higher value drove improvements in gross, pre-tax, and net margins year to year. And our ongoing share repurchase program contributed the balance, at a level fairly consistent with last quarter.
This quarter, we delivered 14% EPS growth and $3.7 billion in free cash flow, despite facing a couple of headwinds. First, we had a strong second quarter last year, with 12% revenue growth, so we had a challenging compare. And second, we are dealing with pretty significant currency dynamics, which impacted our revenue line by about $1 billion. But in spite of these, IBM’s business model enabled our strong profit performance in the current environment.
Now let me comment on a few of the key elements of our model. First, we have been investing to capture opportunities and deliver client value in high growth markets: emerging countries, as well as our key growth initiatives. In the first half, our growth markets countries delivered 9% growth at constant currency. Our business analytics portfolio of services and offerings were up 13% in the first half, led by our GBS consulting practice. In Cloud, we doubled last year’s revenue, with contribution from all areas, private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions. And in the first half, we had revenue growth of more than 20% in the Smarter Planet portfolio, driven by industry specific solutions and our Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities offerings. So we’re getting real performance from the investments we’re making in our growth initiatives.
Another important and unique aspect of our model is the balance between annuity businesses and transaction businesses. Our annuity businesses, which make up the majority of services and software, and reflect our long-term relationships with our clients, provide a solid base of revenue, profit and cash.
Third, we have had underway for some time a series of initiatives to drive productivity. These are real structural changes that improve our business and margins over time, on a sustained, durable basis. This quarter we again expanded our margins, and this year we’ll make further progress towards delivering the productivity savings included in our roadmap.
Finally, we continue to grow our free cash flow and have a solid balance sheet, which allows us to invest in the business while returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. So a combination of our strategy and our business model enabled us to generate strong profit growth in the current environment. And now looking at our first half performance, we’re increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15.10, on track to at least $20 in 2015.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I’ll turn the call back to Mark for final comments.
Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time we would like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi – Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.
Yes, thank you. Mark, you commented on a couple of headwinds namely the top comparison in currency dynamics. Absent from that was any commentary on the macroeconomic environment. And I’m wondering if you can comment on that, particularly in light of services performance because I think when we entered 2012 you said, 70% of services revenue in 2012 will come from backlog and that 70% will be up 3%, with your total services business in the first half is tracking well below that. So perhaps you can address the macroeconomic question in the context to the fact that the services revenue that you are generating this year appears to be very weak?
Mark Loughridge
Okay, Toni very good question. Let me start from a macro perspective for the second quarter. First of all, if you look at the kind of geographic breakdown going first quarter to second quarter, Americas was up 2% in the first one to 1% of the second quarter, really that differential was due to the software compare that we had in the second quarter of last year. And if you look at the third quarter just based on a compare basis, we’ll pick up another 2.5 points, so I feel pretty confident about that content, as it going to the third.
Europe was up 1% in the first quarter, relatively flat in the second quarter; we will talk about that a little more. In Asia, it went from plus 1% in the first quarter to up 4%, so real strength in Asia.
If you look at the distribution of that performance across the month, that was relatively linear; in other words, it didn’t have big fluctuations across the month, but if anything, it relatively strengthened as we went through the quarter, so June was little stronger than the rest of the quarter. In some of our transactional businesses like our hardware base of business, in fact, we noticed that against typical ways of performance had a pretty [down good] last week of the quarter, indicating momentum as we are going at the third. So that’s why I’d give kind of an overview.
Now from a markets perspective, let’s talk about the growth markets. They continue to perform well across the board; BRIC countries were up 12%, they represent about a third of our overall growth market business; within that China was up the very impressive 24%, and I’d remind you, we now have opened our 68th face-to-face branch in China, we have over 100 virtual branches. Total growth markets outpace the majors again by 9 points, this quarter up 8% on a constant currency basis and within that, we have 32 countries up double digits, every sector grew, every brand grew, software and services were up 10% our z business in the growth markets was up 11%, so I think this reflects really kind of broad based strong performance in those markets.
Major markets as you would expect little more mix, I just going to spend a little time on Europe; within Europe, we did see growth than the U.K. and Spain, U.K. for their 11th quarter in the row, Spain, the seventh quarter, Germany was flat and now this is the third quarter of either flat to modest growth at Germany, but again, Italy and France were down, so kind of mixed performance within the European geography.
Third, I kind of look at brand performance, so on a software base, we had strong performance in Europe and Asia. And in North America was really, as I said earlier, kind of an issue of compares which we can talk about a little later.
Hardware at this point in the cycle, no real surprises, and I said early, if anything z did a little better job as it went through the quarter. Again, real strength in z, up a 11% in growth markets. In services, I would say, really pretty consistent with last quarter.
Now to your services point, if you do the math, we had said, that opening backlog drives about 70% of revenue. So 70% of the 3% backlog run out would be about 2%. So if you look at GTS, certainly that a conformed with that kind of a relationship. In GBS, we are down 1%, we did see in GBS, some improvements in Japan in public sector but they were still down.
Now within the GBS business, what I’d point out within the organizational structure, as we move resource some kind of historical big rollout complex product structures, that are often times custom into our growth initiatives, you’ll see some impact in that translation, but what we see in those growth initiatives within GTS, really strong growth performance, up double-digit across the board within GBS, and likewise, then IBM, up strong double-digit across the board, pulling with it about 50% software mix. Within that GBS content alone, the margins within those growth initiatives are about three points richer than the balance of the business and that help, contribute to return to proper growth in the GBS in the second quarter, up 7%.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. Let’s go to the next question.
Operator
The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
Bill C. Shope – Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Okay, thank you. Looking at the guidance, can you help us understand your thoughts on both the earnings and revenue trajectory to the third and the fourth quarter? And regarding the sale of the point-of-sale business that you talked about last quarter, how should we think about the timing of that gain now and the timing of the work force for balancing charges that will periodically counter that gain?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Great question, Bill. So if you look at the full year we’ve taken our guidance up to at least $15.10 and that would imply for the second half about 10% EPS growth. Now within that EPS growth, it’s reasonably distributed across both the third and the fourth quarter if anything a little skewed to the fourth quarter of the new product announcements. Currency in the second half is going to be a headwind, about four to five points in the third quarter, two to three points in the fourth and that spot rates that would be a headwind for us, about $2 billion in the second half compared to the $1 billion that we just had in the second quarter.
On a third quarter basis, I would say that our constant currency revenue growth should be approximately equal to what we saw in the dynamics in the first half of the year with the fourth quarter really presenting opportunity with our new announcements for additional growth. So back to your second half of your question, we regard this really as an all in forecast. We realized that we do have some tax headwind as we entered the third and the fourth quarter. The divestiture of our retail store systems business should generate a gain of about $450 million to $550 million in the second half. We do expect to close that shortly with the major countries really closing first. So the gain will be recognized as we close those counties and get the cash. And I would expect that both of that to happen in third quarter, but based on country closing some may extend in to the fourth.
Now, as we’ve discussed a number of times in the past, when we get that cash inflow from a divestiture, we put that to good work to improve the productivity of our business and that’s why these divestitures are accretive to IBM. So constantly, we will also have workforce rebalancing in the second half, I expect slightly greater than the first half of 2012. Now that workforce rebalancing will be focused on our non-U.S. operations, very little, but really in the U.S. So all in all, we feel optimistic about our hand for the second half in spite of the headwinds that we see.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Bill. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Ben Reitzes – Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, thank a lot. Mark, when I look at your earnings year-over-year, you improved about $0.42 and I can get about $0.17 from share repo, but I get like $0.23 from GTS margin expansion considering revenue was down a little. That was a really good margin performance in GTS. I guess the question is how sustainable is this 3.6 percentage point improvement year-over-year, can you just – you went over it already in the call little bit, can you reiterate what you’re doing to make that sustainable in GTS and maybe how those rebalancings are working into the equation as well? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
Sure, sure, absolutely, Ben. So first of all in the context, as we go into the second half of the year for our services business, we see strong profit growth across services from both the GTS and GBS organizations. So I think we have a very good hand as we go into. Now you know we run this business for profit and cash contribution, a couple of key dynamics within that, within GMU, we had very good margin performance in our business there, our revenue in GMU, our growth markets unit is up 10%, that’s 10 points faster than we see in the major markets. In fact, over time that’s driven our backlog to also be up 10% in our growth markets unit.
Our transactional business, if you look at the growth initiatives, cloud is more than double, so consequently we see our backlog up to 6%. We have growth in really 14 straight quarters in our transactional business. And I want to return again to the work that we’re doing on ongoing basis in productivity because I think a lot of this is really leadership work on the part of our services organization, especially the GTS content that we saw this quarter driving that 24% increase year-to-year.
A lot of that is driven by automation and the partnering that they’ve done with research that gives us unique capability that I don’t think you’d see in our competitors. As well as utilizing the global scale, but once again I want to turn to the work that we’ve done on the distribution of profitability in our contract. So once again, if you imagine this as a normal curve distribution of the profitability within the services contracts, they did a very discrete piece of work on how to improve the value contribution in the context of those – contracts in that weaker end of the distribution.
And that contributed about a third of that 24%, we should see that ongoing to some degree as we go through the year, and I think as we continue to work on that weaker side of the distribution and move actually the average to the right, we continue to contribute. Again, if you wanted to put in a context of backlog, to generate that same level of profitability in our outsourcing business, our opening backlog this year would have needed to have been richer by about $5 billion to $10 billion. So once again you can see how the impact of that work, how it is relative to the backlog and I think it’s very consistent with our overall objective to manage these business for profit and cash generation.
Patricia Murphy

Thank you, Ben. Operator, can we take the next question please.

Next question comes from Scott Craig with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.
Scott D. Craig – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch

Hey thanks. Good afternoon. Hi Mark can you go through a little bit with regards to the systematic disciplined approach being taken with some of the lower margin businesses in the services side. So where are we in that process and how much of that been helping the margins and should we expect that to continue here for six months or 12 months, how do you think about that whole dynamic? Thank you.
Mark Loughridge
Well, first of all I want to point out that that work really driving that impact really is something that the GTS organization has been implementing relatively over the past six to nine months starting out. So, and the objective was, we do so much work in driving our competitive position on the engagement, what can we do to really help drive our level of productivity in a ongoing basis as well. And so to start that, it seemed very logical, let’s pick the contracts that really in that left tail of the distribution of contracts.
So that was the first starting point that they took. And then they applied kind of leadership delivery content, real value ad content and these are elements that when you apply them to the left hand tail of the distribution, if you can move that average it has tremendous impacts. So I think that that approach, that approach of really on an ongoing basis working hard to apply better value contribution to drive that margin is something that we can continue to apply both in our GTS and GBS businesses and they really had substantial impact that contribute to that operational performance that we saw in GTS.
Patricia Murphy

Thanks, Scott. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners. You may ask your question.
Robert Cihra – Evercore Partners Inc.

Hi. Thank you very much. I was wondering if I could, I guess, dig into the hardware a little deeper, and I guess there’s two things really, the mainframe although is down, was certainly down less than what I’ve thought. I’m just wondering if you can give some color there. And then, with System x, I guess that would be, it was weaker even with the new [runway] cycle and it looks like you’ve lost a little share. Is there anything positioning-wise going on there or do you think it’s just the product cycling or any change within IBM? Do you think that the high-end was strong? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge

Sure. Well, if you look at the high-end performance, I quite agree with your observation. For this position in the product cycle we do really have stronger z performance than you would have statistically kind of expected to have. A lot of that, in my opening remarks, we saw downward growth in our z content in the growth markets. And so, the growth market z content was up 11%. Well, you can drive 11% growth in the substantial part of your business in those growth markets that have new opportunities for us that obviously has substantial leverage in our business.
So the z performance did improve. Some of that was backend loaded in the quarter and we did see, as I pointed out earlier, that last week of the quarter we saw an uptick in our SCV business as we left the second entry and the third. On an x basis, they really did face a very tough competitor last year. If you remember they were up 15% in 2011. So that really did contribute to a lot of it.
The high-end, we did have a double-digit growth and we’ve had double-digit growth on the high-end for eight of the last nine quarters including the second quarter. So as we go into the second half, we do have some very good content the x series business will take advantage of their content within peer systems. And they will be part of the move as we go into our second half announcements of volume roll out.

The next question comes from Brian Marshall with ISI Group. You may ask your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, thanks. This is Stephen calling for Brian. We’ve been hearing a lot lately about the new public cloud offerings, and I was wondering if you could talk a bit more...
Patricia Murphy
Brian, it’s kind of hard to hear you. Can you start again?
Unidentified Analyst
Can you hear me better now?
Patricia Murphy
Much better. Thank you.
Unidentified Analyst
We’ve been hearing a lot lately about new public cloud offerings and I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about your progress with smart cloud, what kind of adoption are you seeing and are there any particular services that are driving your growth in public cloud?
Mark Loughridge
Well, if you look at our cloud offerings and we’ve been pretty pleased with the overall growth rates. So if you look at that first half, we had very strong performance with our roll out doubling, as we went through the first half. And that’s been a big part of the overall momentum we see across our growth initiatives business analytics, Smarter Planet or growth markets and our cloud performance. Now, within cloud, we do drive public cloud, but we also drive the enterprise attention for cloud and the mechanisms for our customers to set up their cloud operations within their business, and in sometimes are more responsive to their requirements for real security and which we can provide as well, but overall we think that the cloud business both in 2011 and first half of 2012 has been spot on for us.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Brian. Let’s go to the next question please.

The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
Steven Milunovich – UBS
Thank you. I was going to say that things actually have held up surprisingly well, you mentioned the constant currency growth by geography, Mark. In the back, you gave your industry numbers and constant currency I think finance is up 1, public is up 4, they are actually among your better performing sectors. So perhaps you can explain that and is there a risk that you have to see the cliff in a sense?
Mark Loughridge
Well, that’s a great – that’s really a great point, Steve. I think as you look across the sectors, it really gives an interesting perspective on our business. So if you look at general business GB, I mean that was up 5%. Frankly, within GB we have really 60% of our Smarter Planet references, so it’s a pretty strong sector in its own right, but it’s also a good vehicle for many of our growth initiatives. And that plus 5% is – representative of 10 consecutive quarters of growth.
Secondly in public, public was up 4%. And if you look underneath public sector government was up 4%, education was up 16% and our health and life sciences business was up 3% for the 21st quarter of growth in that area. Within our public sector and education, we installed the fastest computer in the world in the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. So very good performance in public and an indication of the kind of roll out our initiatives have had. In industrial, we were up 3% that was highly driven by automotive that was up 11%. And as you said, when you open financial services was inline with IBM; interestingly, within financial services, our growth markets unit was up 12%. So really, really strong performance in the financial service in our growth markets business.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Steve. Let’s go to the next question please?
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Mark Moskowitz – JPMorgan
Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon, Mark. I had a question regarding the software business, I think you said earlier that IBM expects to hire 200 to 300 new sales reps each month for the rest of the year, and you also talked about middleware – key brand of middleware growing inline with the market, what should we take from that, does that mean the run rate of above market growth is starting to peter out here, is there anything competitively speaking here going on, can you just kind of give us a little more color that is really appreciative.
Mark Loughridge
Yeah. No, I think, I think that’s a very important question. So if you look at the software business, let’s first look at the performance we had in the non-U.S. business, so for software outside of U.S., we had 4% growth in Europe, now that’s a very, very good performance in my book in Europe in the current conditions; in Japan, we had 6% growth in software; in growth markets, we had 10% growth in software. So all of those constant currency references all strong performance from my perspective all were meeting the objectives that we had set.
The U.S. organization really faced just the difficult compare in last year, I mean that’s kind of function of their achievement in the prior year, they’re up 17%. So that 17% historical achievement drove the performance last year for the total software business is 10.5% growth. So as we look at the compare for the third quarter that’s about 8% growth. So we’re going to pick up about 2.5 points just on a compare, as the software business moves into the third quarter.
Now the other point I wanted to make is, we are continuing to invest in the software business in a very big way, acquisitions to drive and integrate with those solutions, continuing the higher 1 to 200 software reps every month, so we think of anything we have a very strong hand as we go into the second half. I think the first half performance was very, very good; and in the third quarter, we should see growth rates so we are consistent with the first quarter performance.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Mark. Let’s go to the next question please?

The next question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.
Christopher Whitmore – Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the competitive environment in services and maybe ask the margin question in a different way. We heard from some of your competitors their pricing for new deals has gotten more aggressive and you are not growing your bookings and your backlog much on an organic basis. Is IBM making the decision to you to be less aggressive on competing for new deals in order to reap the gains from your productivity initiatives or is something else going on?
Mark Loughridge
Well, first of all, when you look at the overall performance in the business, our transactional backlog is up 6%, and we had growth in our transactional backlog now for 14 straight quarters. So I think that’s pretty good performance on that transactional side of the house. And if you look at the operating base for the – outsource inside of the house, we do have very strong growth, in our overall services business, in our growth markets. So I think we are driving aggressively around the world. I think we are driving leadership costs, I will say that consistent with the IBM business point of equation we are driving for real profit and cash generation and return on our investments, but I think we’ve got a good play with some areas of very strong performance.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Chris. Can we take one last question, please, operator?
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from David Grossman from Stifel Nicolas. You may ask your question. Sir, your line is open. Please check your mute button.
David Grossman – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. 
Sure, thank you. So Mark the emerging markets have been very resilient. Can you help us better understand the composition of the mix in that geographic segment, and the visibility over the next several months relative to the other geographies that you serve?
Mark Loughridge

Yeah, one way to look at that relative mix is to look at it both from kind of a sector stand – let’s look it from a sector standpoint, then let’s look it from a brand standpoint and then we’ll look at the distributed across the growth within country. So, first of all, if you look at the performance in the growth markets, I mean, I think for them they’re once again be stronger than we had seen in the major markets by nine points and that’s a trend line that we’ve seen in 2008, 2009, 2010. We’ve seen that for a long time, 2011, first half of this year that has been a very, very consistent phenomena for us. And if you look at the individual quarter it’s been pretty strong by individual quarters.
Now if you look at the BRICS, the BRICS were up 12%. Within that, as I have said, China was up a very strong 24%. Russia was up very, very strong. Within that mix of business we had real power within the z side of the house in China, but if you look at across the sector dimension, and the brand dimension, I mean we had really strong growth in our sectors, every single sectors had growth, strong growth in the growth markets. We had very strong growth across every single brand, our software business grew double-digit, our services businesses grew double-digit within our STG content, with z growing a 11%.
And I’d remind you that it’s not just constructed within the BRICs, that’s about a third of our business. So two thirds of our business was also going very, very well and we had this double-digit growth phenomena across 32 countries.
So I think the composition of their growth this quarter was balanced across the sectors, was balanced across the brands and indicative of both the BRIC countries and the broader view of the growth market. So with that let me ramp up the call.
I think our results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of IBMs business model delivering profit and cash on a sustained basis. And despite currency headwinds and a tough type line compare, we delivered strong performance, 8% growth in profit, 14% growth in operating EPS both in the quarter and for the first half. But I don’t want you to miss, what I consider to be the most important metric this quarter, and that’s our cash performance.
I mean, we generated $18 billion of free cash flow over the last 12 months, and that’s a milestone for IBM. Let me put that in perspective. We generated $16.6 billion last year. 10 years ago, we generated just under $6 billion, so in the last decade, we’ve increased the level of free cash flow generation by three times and I think that’s a real achievement because it’s left free cash flow that’s in fact the fuel that we use to power this engine. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15.10 of operating EPS. That’s up 12% from last year and on track to at least $20 in 2015.
So thanks for joining us and now, as always, back to work.

Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Loughridge.
Mark Loughridge
Thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we have reported $24.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.78, which is up 15% year-to-year. And now, 90 days into the year, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating EPS to at least $15. This is up $0.15 from our previous view of at least $14.85. 
Looking at the results by segment. We continued our strong performance in software as we aggressively address opportunities in analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet. Our software profit was up 12%. 
In services, we expanded margins and increased Total Services profit by 11% as we leverage our productivity initiatives and mix to higher margin offerings in markets. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 10% at constant currency. And our backlog in growth markets was up 14% at constant currency. 
As expected, our hardware business declined as compared to a very strong growth of 19% in the first quarter of last year. This quarter, we extended our leadership in the UNIX market as we continued our competitive displacements in POWER. 
And just last week, we announced PureSystems, the first new class of computing in over 20 years. This solution leverages IBM's decades-long investment in innovation and radically simplifies enterprise computing. This should start to contribute to the systems performance in the second half of the year.
Turning to profit. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. We expanded operating gross margin by over a point, led by services. And our operating net margin was up a similar amount, 1.1 points. Within net income, this quarter, we had a couple of unique items that impacted the dynamic between operating pretax income and our tax rate. 
You'll recall that in the first quarter of last year, our workforce rebalancing was essentially offset by one-time investment gains. This quarter, our workforce rebalancing was very similar to last year. But this year, the charge was offset by a one-time tax benefit associated with a tax restructuring in Latin America. Excluding this one-time benefit, we expect our full year annual effective tax rate to still be in the range of 25%.
So a very similar dynamic to last year: with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalance charges, though, this year, the offset is included below the PTI line in tax. So through margin expansion, together with effective use of cash, we delivered operating EPS of $2.78, which was up 15% year-to-year.
Turning to cash flow. We generated almost $2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, really strong performance. In addition to returning value to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, our cash flow is enabling the ongoing transformation of the business, acquiring key capabilities and focusing our portfolio on the areas where we can add the most value. 
This quarter, we closed 5 acquisitions for a total of $1.3 billion. The acquisitions increased our capabilities in analytics and cloud and our Smarter Planet initiatives. Now we'll get into the first quarter details starting with revenue by geography, where, as always, I'll discuss the results on a local currency basis.
In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency was very consistent with the fourth quarter and in line with our expectations. Revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. Within the Americas, performance was led by Canada, which was up 9%. The U.S. was flat, off of last year's strong growth of 7%. Europe, again, grew at 1%, in line with the fourth quarter, so we're seeing some stability there. 
The most consistent performance has come from the U.K. and Spain. With 10% growth, the U.K. has delivered 10 consecutive quarters of growth. And Spain continues to leverage its global relationships, now growing in each of the last 6 quarters. Germany posted modest growth, while France declined.
Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 10 points of revenue growth. Even with a tough compare, the BRICs had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with about 60% of our growth markets business outside the BRICs, altogether, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth markets countries. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of share gains in the growth markets, and we're accelerating our market expansion initiative to continue that success.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was very consistent with the last few quarters. And Global Business Services growth rate continued to be impacted by weakness in Japan and public sector. Our software business had another great quarter, driven by our offerings in business analytics, Smarter Commerce and storage management. 
In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a very strong first quarter, driven by product cycles in mainframe and POWER. So our growth rate this quarter reflects that difficult compare, though we continued to take share in UNIX.
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross profit margin improved 1.2 points, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength in software. Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 3%. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed 2 points of the increase. Currency from both translation and hedging dynamics reduced expense growth by 2 points, and our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up 3 points. I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. 
First, in last year's results, we had investment gains of over $200 million, primarily for the sale of Lenovo shares. This gain effectively funded the $220 million of workforce rebalancing charges in last year's first quarter. This year, we had a one-time tax benefit from a tax restructuring in Latin America, and the tax benefit offset the workforce rebalancing charges, which, again, were about $220 million. So the net effect to net income was negligible, both within the period and year-to-year.
Another expense item I'll comment on is a year-to-year help from our hedging programs. We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. Last year, hedging programs generated losses in the quarter. This year, our hedging was down $125 million year-to-year, as you would expect, given the year-to-year changes in currencies. Of this, about $85 million year-to-year is an expense, most of which is in other income and expense. Now keep in mind that you can't look at hedges in isolation. They mitigate the translation impacts across the P&L.
So now let me go into the segments. The 2 Services segments delivered $14.7 billion in revenue, grew pretax profit by 11% and expanded pretax margin by 1.3 points. Backlog was $139 billion, down 2% at actual rates and up 1% at constant currency. We started 2012 with continued momentum in our growth initiatives, margin expansion and strong profit growth. 
Revenue in the growth markets was up double digits at constant currency again this quarter, driven by strong backlog growth. Total growth markets' backlog was up 14% year-to-year at constant currency, reflecting strong demand for both our outsourcing and transactional services in these markets. We also had strong performance in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet offerings.
Moving on to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10 billion, up 2% or 3% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% or 3% at constant currency, and we gained share again this quarter. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 3%. We had great performance in the growth markets, up 14% year-to-year at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 20% and pretax margin up 2.2 points. 
There were 3 primary drivers of this margin expansion. First, we continued to benefit from efforts to deliver productivity and efficiency within GTS and in conjunction with the enterprise productivity initiatives. Second, we continued to get higher margins in the faster growing growth markets. And finally, GTS has done a tremendous amount of work managing their large portfolio of outsourcing contracts. Within that portfolio, there's a mix of contracts with different profit characteristics. We have taken a systematic and disciplined approach to solving problems in a select set of lower margin contracts, and we're seeing the yield from these efforts in our margin.
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.6 billion, down 2% or 1% at constant currency. We had modest declines in both Application Outsourcing and consulting and systems integration. I previously mentioned the strong results in business analytics and Smarter Planet, where GBS is leading many of the engagements across IBM. Within GBS, business analytics grew 16% and Smarter Planet grew 18%. These are very important initiatives for IBM. 
From a geographic perspective, the growth markets continued to perform well, with double-digit growth again this quarter, while the major markets continued to be weighed down by Japan and by public sector, which declined more sharply this quarter. Japan and public sector, which represent over 1/3 of total Global Business Services revenue, impacted the overall GBS constant currency growth rate by 6 points. GBS pretax income was also impacted by Japan this quarter. Two large contracts in Japan impacted our profit by almost $60 million. So Japan impacted both our profit growth and revenue growth in GBS this quarter. 
But as you know, we have a good track record of managing a broad portfolio of contracts. This quarter, our Total Services business delivered double-digit profit growth, and we feel confident that we can continue throughout the year.
Software had another strong quarter, with revenue of $5.6 billion, up 5% or 7% at constant currency. Key branded middleware gained share for the 18th straight quarter as our software revenue mixes to the faster-growing branded middleware. This quarter, branded middleware accounted for 62% of our total software, up a point from the same period last year. Gartner once again named IBM the worldwide market share leader in the application infrastructure and middleware segment, an announcement that marks the beginning of the second decade of software leadership for IBM.
Segment pretax income was $1.9 billion, up 12% from last year. Now let me take you through the drivers by brand. WebSphere had another excellent quarter, growing 16% and gaining share for the 14th consecutive quarter. Within WebSphere, we had a strong contribution from our application server products and continued momentum in Smarter Commerce. 
In the first quarter, we strengthened our Smarter Commerce integrated portfolio by completing the acquisition of DemandTec, a leader of pricing and promotion optimization solutions and our acquisition of Emptoris, which helps clients reduce procurement costs and risks. 
With 5% growth, Information Management continues to perform well and gain share. Business analytics had a very strong quarter, with double-digit growth in Cognos. Our acceleration in Cognos is driven by the successful integration of our predictive capabilities into recent product launches spanning both business intelligence and financial performance management. 
We continue to expand our global Netezza footprint, with about 2/3 of our new clients outside of North America. For the quarter, Netezza had a win rate of nearly 80% and head-to-head proof of concepts engagements.
Tivoli software was up 5%, and we held share. Within Tivoli, our storage portfolio was up double digits once again. Security, including Q1 Labs, contributed to our Tivoli growth, as clients turned to IBM for intelligence, integration and expertise across our comprehensive framework of solutions. 
Rational grew 1%, and we gained share. Performance was driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Telelogic. Overall, software had another terrific quarter, with revenue up 7% at constant currency, pretax income up 12% and pretax margins up 1.9 points. With this performance, software was a strong contributor to our growth initiatives.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.7 billion was down 7% following the very strong growth a year ago. System z revenue declined 25% versus last year's first quarter growth of over 40%. MIPS declined 5% this quarter, and we mixed towards specialty engines. System z gross profit margin was up again, which is typical at this point in the product cycle. 
POWER was flat and up 1% at constant currency. We had particular strength this quarter in POWER high-performance computing solutions. In POWER, we had over 250 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $200 million of business. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance from Oracle Sun. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
System x revenue was flat, and we held share. The System x revenue in the growth markets was up 17% at constant currency. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in these emerging markets. The storage hardware revenue was down 4%. The value continues to shift to software. And this quarter, storage software was up 18%.
Last week, we established a new category of computing with the introduction of PureSystems, a new family of expert integrated systems that leverages decades of IBM's innovation with market-leading software to help clients address the economics and complexity of deploying new IT infrastructure. These revolutionary systems will enable clients to implement and manage new IT capabilities quickly and efficiently. 
Currently, companies spend 70% or more of IT budgets on simple operations and maintenance. PureSystems has the potential to lower total IT costs by more than 50% over 3 years, allowing the business to reinvest these savings towards new projects and innovation. These new expert integrated systems demonstrate the breadth of our innovation and the value we bring to our customers. This will start to contribute to our performance in the second half.
Also, you may have seen we just announced the sale of our retail store solutions business to Toshiba TEC and the creation of a partnership to address the Smarter Commerce opportunity. The financial implications will be outlined on our investor website, including commentary on the expected gain and how we expect to offset it with additional workforce rebalancing activity, primarily outside the United States. But what's really important is the relationship going forward. We're partnering with the world leader in point-of-sale systems. At the same time, we'll continue to build out our Smarter Commerce capabilities and our sweet spot, managing transactions and data and applying analytics. Combined, we'll have the best platform in the market for commerce.
Moving on to cash flow in the quarter. We generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. In the first quarter of last year, our free cash flow was impacted by income tax payments, driven by audit settlement activity. Even if you adjust for the prior year tax impact, we had double-digit growth in free cash flow. The growth was driven by net income and working capital efficiencies. 
Looking at the uses of our cash. We spent $1.3 billion to acquire 5 companies: Platform Computing, Green Hat, Emptoris, Worklight and DemandTec. These acquisitions add to our capabilities in analytics and cloud and Smarter Planet. 
We returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including almost $900 million in dividends, and we bought back 15.5 million shares for $3 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had $5.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.3 billion, up $400 million from year-end. Total debt was $32.1 billion, of which $23.6 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $8.5 billion, up from $8 billion at year-end. At these debt levels, non-financing debt-to-cap was 33%, up 1 point from year-end. We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility, and our balance sheet remains strong to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with a summary of the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance this quarter. Our ongoing focus on productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance, with gross pretax and net margins all up year-to-year. And the lower share count contributed $0.15, fairly consistent with last quarter. 
In fact, when you look at this quarter, it's really very similar to the fourth quarter in terms of the revenue growth, margin expansion and contribution from share repurchase. Even at the segment in geography level, revenue growth was similar to the fourth. Once again, our growth initiatives led the performance. Our growth markets' initiatives is based on expanding into new markets, building out IT infrastructures and leading in targeted industries. We have consistently delivered powerful performance and share gains. This quarter, growth markets revenue was up 9%, with 40 countries delivering double-digit growth at constant currency. 
In business analytics, we have a broad portfolio of analytic solutions to help our clients deal with the massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Our solutions are built on decades of organic investments, 30 acquisitions since 2005 and more than 9,000 consultants in GBS. This quarter, IBM's business analytics revenue was up 14%.
Cloud provides an efficient and flexible delivery platform that improves the economics of IT. Our smart cloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements. Total cloud revenue doubled over last year, with strong contribution from all areas: private cloud, public cloud and our industry-based solutions. This all comes together in our Smarter Planet solutions. With over 25% growth this quarter, Smarter Planet continues to deliver strong growth driven by our new Smarter City solutions and continued strength in Smarter Commerce offerings. When you look at our offerings in business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of the revenue is software, so the success we're having in our growth initiatives is improving our business mix and margin. 
At the same time, we're continuing to invest in R&D, capital and acquisitions in support of these key areas. This investment is enabling us not only to expand existing markets, but actually create new markets and new categories of computing. Last week's announcement of PureSystems was a great example of how we're leveraging our organic research and development to create a game-changing solution for our clients.
So looking at our first quarter performance and all of these factors, we're increasing our full year 2012 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $15. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. Second, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. 
Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]  The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I was wondering if you could comment on the services business. I look at GBS and on a reported basis, it was down 2%, and I realize its public and Japan contributing very negative growth overall. But do you actually see that getting any better going forward? And in fact, it seems like it's getting marginally worse. And when I look at the outsourcing side, your backlog is now down 5% relative to a year ago. And backlog is a good leading indicator, especially in the outsourcing business. So perhaps you can help us understand how things get better from here. And on an as-reported basis, can GBS grow this year? And with a minus 5% backlog in outsourcing, how does that grow from here for the remainder of the year?
Mark Loughridge
Okay, Toni, a very good question. Let's start from first principles. First of all, when we started the quarter, we told you that the backlog run out we expected would be up 3% year-to-year. So in other words, we're looking at one, at the backlog for total services that it should influence revenue this year. And that backlog should affect about 70% of the revenue, so 70% of that 3% will drive about 2% revenue. And we had indicated that we felt confident that at that level of revenue, we could drive double-digit profit growth for the year. So let's look at it now by the individual units. If you look at GTS, I would argue they're right on track. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 2.6% performance from our GTS team, and I think it's an indication that we do have that model specified correctly. And with that 2.6%, what did they do? They drove 20% profit growth and 2 points of margin improvement. So again, very consistent with our indication. When you look at GBS, actually the mechanics underneath that more on track, but we did get clipped by a couple of contracts that were more challenging for us. I gave you an example of a couple in Japan that impacted our profit by $60 million. Now outside of those 2 contracts, frankly, GBS would have grown their profit on a year-to-year basis. So if you consider those 2 contracts, I would tell you, number one, I think from a financial standpoint, we had the bulk of that behind us. And I don't expect and I don't see contracts in the distribution that will have that kind of impact going forward. Now I can't predict the future, but I do have a pretty good purview to the contracts that we're working on. Secondly, I'll tell you that GBS has, generally, over a longer period of time, been pretty good at managing these challenging contract elements. So I think from my perspective, this is a bit of an anomaly, and GBS should get these 2 contracts behind them in the first and improve their performance to more typical levels as we go into the second quarter. By the way, just as an aside I'd add, that if you look at IBM's revenue growth for services, up 1%, we were shy of 2% by $7 million. That's $7 million on a $15 billion base, so obviously, very close to the 2% level to begin with. I would also reiterate that even in the face of that, we had double-digit profit growth in services for the quarter, and we feel quite confident, given all of the elements that we see in the business equation for Services, we should be driving double-digit profit growth for the year.
Operator
The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I have a question off of the profit comment you just made on services. How should we think about the drivers of pretax margin this year and frankly, beyond this year? You've had some pretty substantial improvements here. So how do we think about how much room you have left, a steady state on pretax services margins, which are certainly approaching record levels on an annualized basis? And frankly, where do you have room left to enact further savings?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. If you look at -- let's look of the drivers underneath the performance in our GTS business, again, profit up 20%, 2 points of margin. How did we achieve that and what do they have as far as sustainability going into the future? So number one, they -- GTS business, and frankly GBS as well, but GTS on a large part is a beneficiary of all the work that we're doing on productivity. Now you remember, at the Investor Day, Linda Sanford defined that and how we were  managing that across those elements. The objective is about $8 billion over the roadmap period. We felt that we did quite well on that base last year. And I'll tell you that our view is that we're right on track in the first quarter. GTS once again benefits from that work. And they are really part and parcel of all the elements that we drive for productivity and spend management. Number 2, with those advanced tools and intellectual property, we're also working on not only the margins in the overall distribution but also the margins in the products that I would call the tail of the distribution, so more challenging contracts. And this year, the GTS team did a great piece of work on those contracts in the low-margin tail in the distribution of thousands of contracts and generated a very meaningful improvement in profitability that we know analytically extends throughout the year. And then lastly, I'll tell you, as we look at the dynamics in that business, our backlog growth for Total Services was up 14% in the growth markets. And in the growth markets, what we're seeing is we have 2 points better margin actually in those deals as well. So those 3 are ongoing dynamics, in my mind, and give us confidence that we have a strong play going forward.

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Mark, by guiding to $15-plus from $14.85-plus in effect with the $0.13 of upside versus the street, it would seem like you're backing where the street is for the rest of the year in EPS perhaps by quarter, at least for the 3 quarters of the year. And I was wondering if you agree with that comment. And then otherwise, what would be the upside drivers to those? Would there be cost-cutting? And/or is there any potential for revenues to start beating expectations as you go throughout the year with this IT environment?
Mark Loughridge
Sure, Ben. Very good point. If you look at the performance in the quarter, EPS up 15%, a very strong performance in our overall net income. Our cash flow -- free cash flow in the business, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. Even if you take into consideration last year's tax payment, that was up $300 million or 16%. So to me, the characteristics of this first quarter are quite strong. And really, it was based on our confidence in characteristics of the quarter and the going-forward equation that encouraged us to take our view of the business up $0.15. Now remember, taking your view of the business, up $0.15 only 90 days into the quarter, I think is a real show of confidence. If you look at the next 3 quarters, we see them up about 10%. And that 10% is the underpinnings to what we view is an at least $15 for the year. Now that 10% across those quarters is reasonably uniform. I do think the third quarter is probably a little tighter for us, but reasonably uniform. And at 10%, given a $15 base of performance on  -- at the least basis for 2012, that's all the trajectory we need to get to $20 by 2015. So to me, I would say that to build base of the business looks like it's in pretty darn good shape and on track to achieve our longer-term objective in 2015. Now to your point, what do we see going forward? There's a couple of dynamics that I would remind you of. Number one -- and maybe a way to look at this is kind of headwinds, tailwinds. So as we look at it going forward for the second quarter or third quarter, we still will see the headwind from currency at about 3 points. We will still, as we go through the second quarter, have the compares challenged for us in the hardware base of business. As well, we will still be wrestling with the issues that we see in Japan in the second quarter. But I think, when we go to the second half, first of all, we have very strong software momentum. Second of all, we have a stable base of profitability and margin performance in our services business. But when you get to the hardware base of business, we have new announcement content that should drive that performance. We should regain revenue growth in the second half based on those new announcement, PureSystems being the first installment. And with that, we should see double-digit profitability in the second half from our hardware base as well. Rolling through all of that is the strength of our operating model and the strength of our growth initiatives. But I think stabilizing Japan in the second half and seeing the new announcement contribution from our hardware base of business, that's going to be a significant dynamic.
Operator
The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montréal.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Mark, on the PureSystems, could you give us a little better sense about where you think the opportunities set is? And I'll rephrase the question a different way. IT departments have fixed budgets a year, so if they use or buy PureSystems, what are they not going to buy either of your portfolio and or competitor's portfolios?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, I think that's a very good question. When you look at -- let's look at our IT budget within IBM. If we were sitting here in the meeting with the RCIO and Linda Sanford working on it, what do we work on? We work on the percentage of our IT budget that we're able to move into new content and new opportunity, as opposed to just maintaining our existing base of business. That's how we run it, and we've been doing this year after year after year. Why is that relevant in PureSystems? Well, if you look at it, in a typical IT department, you could be spending about 70% of that budget on these kinds of simple operations and maintenance. We think with the PureSystems content, you'll have the opportunity to reduce that over a 3-year period by over 50%. That's an enormous contribution to your productivity. And as we would interpret that, if we were having that meeting today in my conference room, we would drive even more of our spend into new announcement content and new categories of IT spend. So I think it's a very powerful opportunity for us on a financial base. That doesn't even get to the unique capabilities and patterns of expertise that it has, built-in expertise, then the complex of business, integration by design. I mean, this can be up and running in as little as 4 hours. So to us, PureSystems is a first new system in 2 decades to hit this kind of an industry rollout, and we're very confident that it would go into the second half and as a big element of our game plan going into 2015.
Operator
The next question comes from Joe Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division
I know you talked about Japan. I wonder if we could get the same type of color on what your expectations are for the public sector and Europe in the second half of 2012.
Mark Loughridge
Yes, sure. Let's talk about public sector first. As you could see, within public sector, we had 3% growth. In the quarter, if you break that down, the real strength in public sector was driven by 1, education. And frankly, within education, we have research laboratories as an example. We have a lot of very strong performance on our high-performance computing in our research centers. And secondly, we had real strength in health care and life sciences. They've had their 20th consecutive quarter of growth. So those 2 elements of overall public sector carried the business. On the government base of business, it's still pretty flat. And we see government spending, really globally, more challenged within that base of business. Your second question, really on Europe. Again, I would point out, as I think we've discussed before, Europe is not just a homogenous breakdown of countries. In the U.K., we had 10% growth, U.K. That's the 10th consecutive quarter of growth in the U.K. So it's not as if that's 10% on an easy compare. That's 10% on 2 years of real performance out of the U.K. business. So I think they've done a great job. Spain, we had growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. In Germany, we had growth for the second consecutive quarter. On the flip side, we're still down in France and down in Italy, but I think on balance, Europe to me, looks pretty stable. So if I would characterize it on a global basis going forward, I look at the major markets, we think they're relatively stable on a forward-looking basis. And the growth markets, I think, are showing some real strength.
Operator
The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Mark, you mentioned gain on sale from the point-of-sale business. Can you just give a little more clarity on the potential size and timing of that gain flowing through the P&L? And more importantly since the sale of POS gives you more confidence and flexibility to step up acquisitions and prepare for better top line growth and more mix benefits going into 2013?
Mark Loughridge
Yes. So if you look at the point-of-sale transaction, first of all, let me describe that as really a partnership between IBM and Toshiba TEC. So our objective with this is on a combined basis, to have the best commerce offering on the planet, so this is a real partnership for us. The gain associated with this is in the range of $450 million to $550 million. And we would expect to complete the transaction either late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter. Within that, we're going to maintain, for a 3-year period, a 19.9% equity again as a partner, and we're very confident about this combined offering going forward. Now with that gain, Katy, it gives us the opportunity, 1, to continue the workforce transformation and productivity initiatives we have going. And to your questions on acquisitions, I mean, look at the base free cash flow performance in this business. I mean, $1.9 billion in a first quarter, up $1.1 billion year-to-year. Admittedly, even if you took the tax payment of $300 million, believe me, we have sufficient free cash flow in the evidence of the base business we have today to continue to drive our priorities in our own internal capital, our acquisitions, share repurchase and dividends.
Operator
The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.
David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Mark, I'm just going to back to the GBS gross margins. If we add back the $225 million of rebalancing back to the GBS number, and I don't know if that's right but just assume you do, and take the $60 million, I guess my math is coming out that the margins in GBS would be up modestly year-over-year. And I guess, number one, is that math right? And if so, what really drives the GBS numbers up beyond that in the second half of the year?
Mark Loughridge
Well, first of all, all of that does not apply just within GBS, when you look at the workforce rebalancing number, so that's implied across IBM. And so you can't really look at it that way. You can however -- if you look at those 2 contracts that I described that were more challenging in Japan, that $60 million, if you strip that out, it would have grown on a year-to-year basis and obviously, given the  revenue characteristics, that would have been expanding margin. Now on a go-forward basis, we expect them in the second quarter to get a lot of those large challenging contracts, that we had in Japan behind us from a financial perspective, get back to more normal operating conditions. But to your question on the robustness of our margin performance, I would look at the total services base of business. I mean, this was a very powerful aggregate margin performance from services. And again, as I went through those characteristics that were driving the workforce productivity initiatives with Linda Sanford, the systematic approach to deal with low margin content, the higher margins that we're seeing in Total Services, not just GTS but Total Services and our growth markets unit put all those together, we feel quite confident that we will see margin expansion for the year and generate double-digit profit growth for services.

The next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA.
Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
You've referenced an 80% win rate on Netezza proof of concepts. Could you provide a bit more color on what you're seeing competitively elsewhere in the software division, as well as some of the dynamics around your contract renegotiations on the GTS side?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, well, software -- first of all, Netezza, since the acquisition, if you look at that combined effect over a longer period of time, what a success that's been, and that offering provides a more integrated approach to deal with our customer buying patterns. It's been a real win for us. In a way, I kind of look at it and say, what a good proof of concept that is not only its application in current deal pools, but as an indicator of the kind of opportunity we have with PureSystems going forward. So I think that's been very, very successful. On the software base of business, they had a great quarter. I mean, if you look at that performance, the profitability in the first quarter, $1.9 billion profit, up 12%; the base software content, up 7%; real double-digit strength in that WebSphere platform. I think we have a very, very competitive offering. So the software base of business is doing very, very well competitively. I think Netezza on that kind of integrated offering, really good proof point for us since the acquisition and again, gives us a lot of confidence on this integrated offering of PureSystems, which is not just hardware but hardware, software and services going forward into the second half.

The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division
I was actually hoping if we could go back just to the acquisitions discussion. And just the  -- you spent sort of, whatever, $1.3 billion year-to-date, but you only spent $1.8 billion, I believe, last year. So as part of your 2015 roadmap, you had, I believe, earmarked, call it, around $20 billion for acquisitions. But you're sort of 25% of your way time-wise there and you only spent about 15% on acquisitions. Does that signal any change in your view? Or is it simply that the reality of the math is never that linear and we should be still thinking about similar acquisitions strategy in something around $20  billion?
Mark Loughridge
Well, my advice to you is that the best indicator to use now is $20 billion for acquisitions through 2015. Now let's just go back to the math and the way we've describe this in the investment meetings that we've had in the last couple of years. As you look at it, if you look at that kind of $4 billion a year run rate -- and by the way, this is not going to be linear because it's dependent on how frothy the market or attractive the market is and how it integrates with our initiatives. But if you look at that, we frankly exited 2010 in a very strong position. Remember, we did well over $6 billion in 2010. So when we went through the model at that time, we said, we frankly have a pretty substantial head start. And if you have considered that we don't expect this to be linear. If you look at those -- that 2-year period of 2010 and 2011, $6 billion and $2 billion . On average, we did about $4 billion. So I think that run rate, on average, is a good indicator. I don't think it's going to be $4 billion every year. This year, $1.3 billion just for the first quarter, I would say we're kind of a hit pace [ph] on a run-rate basis. The second point I would make is given that we did get ahead of the profile in 2010 with a very successful set of acquisitions, 17 in total, that, frankly, put us ahead of the game as we looked at our EPS objective for acquisitions as part of the 2015 roadmap. Remember, we're looking for about $0.90. And given that the head start that we had coming out of 2010, we had to be able to hit that $0.90 at a spend rate of between $10 billion and  $15 billion as opposed to $20 billion. So that provides, I think, opportunity for us. But from my perspective, I'd tell you from what I'm doing, I am viewing this as an opportunity for $20 billion in our treasury and our capital planning processes, believe me, we're reserving about $20 billion over the roadmap.

The last question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Mark, you alluded to applying the funds from the point-of-sale to your workforce rebalancing. So that, combined with the $225 million you took this quarter implies $700 million, $750 million of workforce rebalancing charges. Can you talk about the payback on those efforts, the timing on the execution and when we should start to expect that to flow through?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, sure. If you look at the overall view, I would use the 2010 as kind of a guide here. Now this year, it could be a little richer than that, as you correctly pointed out. On a full year basis, the vast majority is going to be spent outside the U.S. So we'll have slightly longer payback periods. But in the dollars that we spent on workforce rebalancing at the first quarter, we expect that to payback in the year. So I think we have a good plan. We still have a lot of work to do. We just signed a deal. We've got a lot of work to do if you get to closing that deal. But I think I would use that as kind of a guide on the workforce rebalancing charges. 
So let me now just take a few moments to wrap up the call. From my perspective, the first quarter had a similar characteristic to the fourth and was a strong start to the year. We had great margin and profit and cash performance and continued the momentum in all of our growth initiatives. Remember, last quarter, I said that in 2012, we'll take a number of actions that position us to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective, including acquisitions and divestitures, investing in key growth initiatives and rebalancing our workforce to where we see the best opportunities. In the last 90 days, we've made great progress. We have a couple of strategic announcements that demonstrate our focus on higher value and ongoing transformation of our business. Our PureSystems announcement is a result of $2 billion of R&D and leverages decades of technology innovation and know-how. It's a new platform, and we believe it's a game-changing event for our clients. And we announced today a strategic partnership with Toshiba TEC that better positions us to address the important Smarter Commerce opportunity. So all of this gives us confidence to take up our expectation for the full year to at least $15 of operating EPS for the year. That's up almost 12% from last year and puts us on a good track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/505151-international-business-machines-management-discusses-q1-2012-results-earnings-call-transcript

Mark Loughridge
Thank you for joining us today. In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue, expanded growth, pretax and net margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $4.71, up 11% year-to-year. For the full year, we delivered revenue of almost $107 billion, which was up 7%, operating pretax income of $21.6 billion, up 9%, and operating EPS of $13.44, up 15%.
Our 2011 results put us well on track to our 2015 roadmap objective. Looking at the fourth quarter by segment, we continued to build our momentum in software, our performance reflecting both strong demand for our offerings and leadership sales execution. Our software revenue was up 9%, driven by aggressive growth in our focus areas like Smarter Commerce, business analytics and storage solutions. Our software profit was up 12%.
Our Services business delivered powerful margin and profit growth, with combined pretax income of 17%. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, which were up 13% at constant currency. Our total services backlog ended the year at $141 billion. At constant currency, that's flat year-to-year and up $5 billion since September.
Within Hardware, Power Systems was up 6% as we continue to drive competitive displacements. We've now had 15 consecutive quarters of share gain in UNIX. In fact, with the exception of mainframe, which was coming off of the biggest quarter in its history last year, each of our 16 brands across the company gained or held share.
Turning to profit, our ongoing focus and productivity, together with the relative strength of our software business, drove strong margin performance. Our operating gross margin was up 1.1 points to over 50%. We expanded operating pretax margins almost a full point and grew pretax income 6%. And while our tax rate was up year-to-year, we still expanded net margin above our model rate.
When you put this all together, we delivered operating EPS of $4.71, which was up 11% and $13.44 for the year, up 15%, making this our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Our strong earnings performance drove $9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $16.6 billion for the year. With that cash, we continue to invest in capital and acquisitions and we delivered significant returns to shareholders with over $18 billion in share repurchase and dividends this year.
Looking forward, we're confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand margin, grow profit, generate cash and return value to shareholders. And in 2012, we expect to deliver at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year.
For the fourth quarter, revenue at constant currency was in line with our expectations. While currency provided a benefit to revenue growth of about 25 basis points in the quarter, currency movement, since we announced our third quarter earnings in October, impacted our revenue by about 1 point of growth or $300 million.
Looking at the geographies on a constant currency basis, revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. In the Americas, Canada had terrific performance, up 13%. The U.S. grew 1% off of last year's very strong growth of 10%.
In Europe, our growth rate improved compared to the third quarter. Germany returned to growth, up 4%, and once again, we had good growth in the U.K. and Spain, which were each up 9%. We've now had 9 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth in the U.K. and Spain has now grown 5 consecutive quarters, leveraging its global relationships.
Our growth markets outpaced the major markets by 8 points of revenue growth. The BRICS had another good quarter. Combined, they were up 11%. And with nearly 2/3 of our growth markets business outside the BRICS, all together, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth market countries, so our performance was broad based.
We're continuing to expand into new countries and territories to build out IT infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key industries. This year, to drive market expansion, we opened 92 new branches and we added over 1,500 new sales reps. We gained 4 points of share in the quarter and 4 points for the year. In 2011, our growth markets grew 11%, which outpaced the majors by 10 points, and growth markets now make up 22% of our geographic revenue.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment, Global Technology Services constant currency revenue growth rate was consistent with the third quarter, while our Global Business Services growth rate improved. In both segments, we had great year-to-year performance in the growth markets, with double-digit constant currency revenue growth and expanding margins.
Our software business had another fantastic quarter, with strength across the portfolio, WebSphere, Information Management and Tivoli all had very good growth and gained share. In Systems and Technology, last year, we had a great fourth quarter with over 20% growth driven by a new mainframe that had almost 70% revenue growth. This quarter, we wrapped around that performance. And we had strength in POWER as we continued to extend our share gains.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margins improved 1.1 points to over 50%, driven by a combination of good margin expansion in both Services segments and an improving segment mix due to the relative strength of software. The services margin improvement was driven by a number of factors, including productivity improvements and mix to higher value offerings and markets. For hardware, our product mix negatively impacted margin.
Finally, our Global Financing business, which is better measured by return on equity, this quarter delivered return on equity of 42%. Now that's impressive. So now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was up 2%, in line with our revenue growth.
Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed a point of growth. And our base expense was up 1%. There was effectively no year-to-year impact from the combination of currency translation and hedging dynamics. I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. As you can see from our income statement, IP income was down $65 million year-to-year.
Second, we had an increase of about $55 million in our accounts receivable provisions, though our reserve coverage is down 30 basis points from a year ago and down 20 points since September. Typically, we talk about the impact of our hedging programs as a driver of expense. However, this quarter was effectively no year-to-year impact on expense due to our hedging programs, consistent with the fact that currency ended up being fairly neutral on a year-to-year basis.
So now let me get into the segments. The 2 Services segments delivered $15.3 billion in revenue, up 3%. The combined Services segments grew pretax profits 17%, and pretax margin was up 2.1 points. Total outsourcing revenue was $7.2 billion, up 4%, and total transactional revenue was $6.2 billion, up 3%. Overall growth was driven by the growth markets, with constant currency revenue up double digits in the outsourcing, transactional and maintenance businesses. Total backlog in the quarter was $141 billion. At constant currency, that is flat year-to-year and up $5 billion quarter-to-quarter.
Moving on to the 2 segments in Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.5 billion, up 3%. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 3% and we gained share in the quarter and full year. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 5%. We had great performance in the growth markets where we're seeing the benefits of geographic expansion in offerings like business continuity and resiliency services.
Global Technology Services delivered very strong profit and margin this quarter, with pretax income up 18% and pretax margin up 2.3 points to 18%. This margin expansion was driven by productivity and cost management, along with a mix into higher-margin growth markets. We had gross margin improvement in all lines of business, outsourcing, ITS and maintenance.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.9 billion, up 3%. Application Outsourcing revenue was up 5%, led by strong performance in the growth markets. Consulting and Systems Integration, which includes consulting, AMS systems integration and the U.S. federal business, grew 2%. At constant currency, our growth rate improved over last quarter.
Overall GBS revenue continued to be impacted by Japan and public sector. So total GBS revenue, excluding Japan and public sector, was up 9% at constant currency and up 8% for the year. And although declines in Japan and public sector continued, we did see some improved performance in public sector. Global Business Services delivered very strong profit and margin performance again this quarter. Pretax profit was up 14% year-to-year, with pretax margin up 1.8 points to 16.6%.
Now I want to spend a minute on backlog and runout as we begin 2012. Last year, in the fourth quarter, we took you through an analysis of the key drivers of Services revenue. We focused the discussion around outsourcing, and in particular, the revenue generated by the runout of the outsourcing backlog.
This year, we have expanded that analysis to give a view of the Total Services backlog runout. This view is more comprehensive and more indicative of the Total Services business as we start the year.
There are 3 primary drivers of Total Services revenue: backlog, sales into our existing contract base and new client signings. A very high percentage of services revenue, roughly 70%, comes from the runout of the backlog we start the year with. In 2012, we expect about 3% revenue growth from that backlog. This gives us a very solid base of revenue to begin the year, with the remaining revenue coming from sales into our existing accounts, which have been on a good trajectory, and new client signings.
So with that, let me wrap up the year in Services. We had very consistent revenue performance in the year driven by stability in the backlog. We continue to build out our services within the growth markets, with Total Services revenue up double digits in those markets and strong margins, with gross margin 2 points higher than that in the majors.
We continue to get good traction in the growth initiatives, cloud, business analytics and Smarter Planet. And we had great profit and margin performance in both Services segments, with GTS pretax profit up 14% and GBS up 18% as we mixed a higher value offerings and markets and continued to drive productivity.
Software had another great quarter, with revenue of $7.6 billion, up 9%. Key Branded Middleware grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter and gained share for the 17th straight quarter as we continue to extend our lead in the middleware market.
Turning to brand performance, WebSphere was up 21% and continues to gain share. Each of WebSphere's 5 product areas grew 10% or better, including our Smarter Commerce offerings, which were up over 25%. This contributed to IBM's performance in the retail industry where we have grown in each of the last 9 quarters. Information Management grew 9% and again gained share. Our distributed database grew double digits, led by strong performances from our Netezza offerings, which were up nearly 70%. This appliance complements and extends our Business Analytics portfolio with a rapidly deployed low-cost of ownership solution for high performance queries and analytics.
For the quarter, almost 1/3 of the transactions were with new Netezza clients. Since acquiring Netezza, IBM has expanded its customer base by over 40%. And when we go head-to-head against competition in proof of concepts, we had a win rate of over 80% this quarter. Our Business Analytics software offerings, most of which are part of Information Management, continue to outpace the market with double-digit growth. IBM's acquisition of Algorithmics in the fourth quarter further strengthens our business analytics and optimization offerings by providing risk analytics capabilities that help customers make informed business decisions.
Tivoli software was up 14% and gained share, driven by storage software growth of 30%. Security solutions also delivered strong growth. With the recent acquisition of Q1 Labs, we can now offer clients a new level of intelligence around security to enable them to better predict, prevent and detect all types of security threats. Rational grew 4% and gained share, driven by strong performance in Telelogic. The fourth quarter wrapped up another powerful year for our software business.
In 2011, software revenue grew 11%, gross margin expanded by 0.5 point and software delivered nearly $10 billion of pretax profit. Systems and Technology revenue of $5.8 billion was down 8%. This performance reflects very strong growth last year, driven by mainframe growth of almost 70%. Gross profit margin was down 3 points year-to-year, with a significant impact from product mix.
Now let me take you through the brands. System z revenue declined 31% as we wrapped on the successful launch of our zEnterprise 196 last year. MIPS declined 4% this quarter. System z gross profit margin was up, reflecting a higher proportion of microcode upgrades, which is typical at this point of the product cycle. POWER grew 6%. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of share gains in POWER.
We continued our success in competitive takeouts. In the fourth quarter, we had over 350 competitive displacements which resulted in over $350 million of business. This is our strongest quarter in terms of competitive displacements since we started tracking this in 2006. Roughly 60% of this business came from HP, with most of the balance coming from Oracle/Sun.
2011 was the second year in a row we had over 1,000 competitive displacements, which this year generated over $1 billion of business. System x revenue declined 2%. We anticipate this is in line with the market. Storage hardware revenue was down 1%. When combined with the storage software growth of 30%, the total grew 5%. Retail Store Solutions had a great quarter, up 9%, and we continued to grow share.
When you look at the full year, Systems and Technology delivered solid performance, with revenue up 6%, gross margin up 1.6 points and $1.6 billion in pretax income, up 12% year-to-year.
Turning to cash flow on a full year basis, we generated $16.6 billion of free cash flow, which is up $300 million over last year. Excluding the impact of the income tax payments driven by audit settlement activity, which I discussed in prior quarters, full year free cash flow would have been up $1.1 billion, roughly in line with our net income growth.
We continue to invest in our business, spending another $4 billion in capital expenditures. When I look at the uses of cash for the year, we returned $18.5 billion to shareholders, including $3.5 billion in dividends, and we bought back almost 89 million shares for $15 billion. At the end of the year, we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
In addition, we spent almost $2 billion to acquire 5 companies. Over the last 2 years, we spent almost $8 billion. In addition, we've announced several acquisitions that didn't close by year end, including Emptoris, DemandTec, Platform Computing and earlier this month, Green Hat. With $9 billion of free cash flow generation in the quarter and $16.6 billion for the year, we're positioned to continue to invest in innovation and return value to shareholders.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.9 billion, up $600 million from September. Total debt was $31.3 billion, of which $23.3 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was $8 billion, up $600 million from the third quarter and up $2.2 billion from a year ago.
Now let me spend a minute on our retirement-related plans and the impact to the balance sheet. Despite volatile market conditions in 2011, we had good returns on global assets. The discount rate environment was challenging, which resulted in an impact to equity at the end of the year. This took our debt-to-cap up to 32%. And we're comfortable operating in this range of 30% to 40%.
At the end of 2011, our defined benefits qualified plans were well funded and our cash requirements remained stable. We have supplemental charts that show the specific performance in rates, as well as a forward-looking view of the P&L and cash implications based on year-end 2011 assumptions with sensitivities. Suffice it to say that as we look forward, while changes in the return on assets and discount rate may drive some volatility in nonoperating elements of the P&L, there is little implication to our cash requirements.
So now let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Knowing that we faced a tough fourth quarter on revenue, we drove other elements of our model, productivity, mix and cash utilization to deliver our earnings performance. Our revenue growth contributed $0.07 to our earnings growth. Our solid gross margin expansion more than offset a higher level of expense and an increase in the tax rate.
Gross margin drove $0.19 of EPS growth, while we had a $0.02 impact from expense and a $0.04 impact from a higher tax rate. All in, margin expansion contributed $0.13. And a lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed $0.26. Bottom line, we delivered 11% EPS growth in the quarter. And for the full year, we delivered 15% growth. Revenue growth was the largest contributor to our earnings growth, though we had good contribution from share repurchase and margin expansion.
So 2011 was another very good year for us, with solid revenue performance, continued margin expansion, strong profit and cash generation and effective use of cash. Our focus on key growth initiatives and investments in innovation are enabling us to expand into new markets and capitalize on trends like analytics and cloud.
Our growth market strategy to expand into new markets, build out IT infrastructures and lead in specific industries is driving powerful performance and share gains. These countries contributed almost 2/3 of IBM's constant currency revenue growth and now represent 22% of IBM's geographic revenue.
Our Business Analytics solutions help our clients leverage massive amounts of data and content to gain insight and optimize results. This year, Business Analytics grew 16%. Our Smarter Planet initiatives generated close to 50% growth. Smarter Commerce, in particular, is gaining momentum by helping companies buy, market, sell and service their products and services. We're not just addressing an existing market, we're actually making markets. And in cloud, we're helping our clients improve the economics of IT.
This year, we continue to expand our offerings. And our cloud revenue in 2011 was more than 3x the prior year. With powerful contribution from these growth initiatives, we delivered 7% revenue growth. We said at the beginning of the year that we expect the growth in the first half of the year to be higher than the second half. By leveraging all of the elements of our model, productivity, mix and utilization of cash, we delivered operating pretax and net income growth of 9% and operating EPS growth of 15%, with double-digit growth in each of the 4 quarters.
So now, as we enter 2012, we expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $14.85 for the year, with the growth rate more skewed to the second half. So we've just completed our centennial year. And as we reach this milestone, we've learned that you have to continually transform and reinvent yourself to be a leader in your industry. IBM's performance is the result of a transformation we started years ago.
We've been shifting our business to higher-value areas, improving productivity and investing to drive future growth. These changes contributed to 9 consecutive years of double-digit earnings per share growth. But more importantly, they strengthened our business and put us on track to achieve our 2015 roadmap objective of at least $20 of operating EPS.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
[Operator Instructions]   Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]   The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Can you comment on your perspective on customer budget activity throughout the quarter and what that may tell you about overall spending intention into 2012? And I guess related to that, outside of currency, how should we think about your overall revenue growth potential this year?
Mark Loughridge
Okay, if you look at our business equation, I mean, to be honest, Bill, we don't really judge that based on what our customers are doing with their budgets. To be honest, I don't know what they're doing with their budgets. I do know what we do with our budget, and it's very similar to the conversations that I have with other CFOs. They're looking for the best value to move their business and move their business rapidly. And so I think it's a measure of our ability to bring value to those clients. If you look at our business and evaluate that now and give us a report card on just those key investment priorities that we had, we did very, very well, I think. Business Analytics, up 16%; cloud computing, more than tripled; Smarter Planet, almost 50% growth. And you look -- now you look at the GMU, another very strong quarter from GMU, BRICS up 11%, GMU, 8 points faster than the majors. So obviously, we are satisfying value considerations within our customer set. You can see that, I think, in the surprising mix, in some respects, of our penetration within individual countries. So when you look at Europe. Europe at 1%, let's take it though and look at it by country, some pretty interesting statistics. Number one, we had Spain growing 9%. That's a fifth quarter of growth sequentially from Spain. We had the U.K. growing 9% for the 9th consecutive quarter. Germany returned to growth, up 4%. Let's look at North America. You look at the U.S., up 1%. That's on the back of that 10% growth last year, driven by our big mainframe announcement. If you look at that on a 2-year basis, that's a 5% compound growth rate, which is pretty strong performance. Canada, up 13%. Strong growth statistics on our growth markets, 40 countries at double-digit. So that's, I think, the best measure of our value, and you can see it in the individual countries. This isn't just a homogenous base across these individual geographies. You can also see it as you look at our overall share performance. So if you look at it and break down from a brand perspective into the 15, 16 composite brands in the business, I mean, we gained or held share in 15 of the 16. So we gained in ITS, Integrated Technology Services, we gained in global process services. We gained in AMS, both SO and SI. We gained in WebSphere, in Information Management, in Tivoli, in Rational, in POWER, Retail Store Solutions. The only brand that we lost share was in mainframe. Now who do you think we lost share to? We lost share to POWER series, our own product line. Every other brand held. So I think that's also a good view of how we're adding value really pretty consistently across the product line as we enter 2012. Now if you look at 2012, your second part of your question, we move into '12 starting with the software business. We had 9% growth in the quarter, about 12% profit growth, very strong performance out of our software base of business. And I’d remind you that software now in 2011 is almost $10 billion of profit. That's up from the beginning of the decade when they were $2.8 billion. Big success, and we move into 2012 with a strong set of opportunities. So I would expect to see similar performance from our software business. When you look at the overall Services business, we gave you, I think, a much more comprehensive metric on revenue. This year, looking at the total backlog of $141 billion, and within that backlog, the runout of the total backlog should be up 3%, covering about 70% of the revenue we need in the year. And you look at our Hardware business, though the Hardware business was -- face a difficult compare in the first half of the year, with new announcement content by the time we get to the second half of the year, I'd expect them to generate mid-single digit growth. So once again, I think we entered the year on the value side, both brand and geographic, with a pretty strong hand.
Operator
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the margin expansion you're seeing in the Services business. This quarter, revenues were up 3% and operating profit was up 17%. If I look at your operating margins, GTS is 18%, GBS is 14%. Those seem extremely high relative to non-Indian peers. I know you spoke to productivity enhancements, but I'd like to, a, better understand what that is. Is that just a code word for labor migration, off-shoring as a result of the headcount reductions you did at the beginning of the year, or what does it mean? And secondly, more importantly, given that you appear to be at best practice, how much room is there and how much confidence do you have that Services operating margins can continue to expand?
Mark Loughridge
Okay, first of all, very good question. Within Services, first of all, I think the Services business did a very, very good job in the year of driving towards higher value offerings and higher value content for their customer set that is able to bring in the other elements of the IBM equation from both software content and hardware business that our competitors are not able to bring to the table. So within the Services businesses, once again, they did a very good job on both the GBS side and the GTS side to continue to improve that value equation to their customer set. And as we look at the contracts that they're now moving and carrying into 2012, they've already done a very strong job on big contracts where we have more challenging financial dynamics that we know we're going to deliver in 2012. But the other point I'd make, Toni, we were very specific in the overall business model for both the 2010 roadmap and the 2015 roadmap of our attention to pull spend and drive productivity across the corporation as a global corporation. That's the $8 billion that we identified in the last Analyst Meeting. And we've done our first down payment on that right on track. Now, who do you think is a beneficiary of a lot of that structural takeout? The Services business. The Services business are a big beneficiary at that large corporate structural takeout. And to a large degree, I think a lot of that operating leverage that we get is unique to IBM and differentiated from our competition and is not given away necessarily in price. So that structure element is a big assist to our overall services margin, right on track for the objectives that we had set and a strong complement. As far as opportunity and headroom, let's look at it from the IBM equation. I mean, we’re still not in the top quartile of the S&P in the tech universe. There's no reason, with the value that we bring to our customer base, that we shouldn't be in that top quartile. It's a very integrated part of our business model that we've integrated into our budgeting systems. And as I said, I do believe we ought to be able to achieve an overall economy of scale of a large corporation, and a lot of that displayed in our Services business. So as our game plan for IBM as a whole, we're going to drive that software mix within IBM, and you can see from the segment results that the PTI for our software business runs between 40% and 50%. We're going to continue to work to spend reductions and productivity, much of that delivering within our Services segment and drive value add in the customer engagement with assets, research and value-add approach.

The next question is from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Mark, would you mind just talking a little bit more about your comment about EPS growth getting higher in the second half? What are the drivers? You grew 11% in the quarter, it would seem, then you decelerate for a few quarters and then reaccelerate to well above that in order to hit your targets. What are the drivers? Is it HDDs being alleviated? Currency cost-cutting or any product cycles that allow you to reaccelerate?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, sure. Let me now take that from the IBM level and then I'll go specifically to your question on kind of the skew in the drivers and the SKU. So as I had said in the earlier questions, if you look at the software-base of business, I think we've got real momentum going into 2012. You saw that in our fourth quarter achievement. Additionally, within that, I can tell you that our acquisition performance for the $6.2 billion of spend that we did in 2010, plus the $1.8 billion that we did, those business case and the performance of those acquisitions against the business case was about the best I've seen in years. Real traction. And I think we entered 2012 with traction on our software business. And I believe they ought to be able to generate double-digit profitability once again. I explained that in our Services business already, in the backlog runout, now against the total backlog for Services, that we already have about 3% in the backlog runout, which would comprise about 70% of our revenue. The balance of the revenue coming from new signings and base growth, even if that new signings base growth were flat, which I don't believe it will be, but even if it were, 70% of the 3 would drive 2% revenue growth in Services. And we showed last year that we could drive double-digit profitability on that base, and we will run the same plays to deliver against that again. So driving for double-digit profit growth in our Services business. The question you asked and the distinction between first half and second half, that's really the STG equation. So STG will have a tough compare in the first half compared to last year's announcement cycle on the high end. But when we get to the new announcements, we get into second half, I would expect that STG should return to mid-single digit revenue growth, and with that, double-digit profit growth. So that, all together, gives us a good handle. Now if you can compare that first half to second half, I'm talking about a couple of points difference between the growth rate that we would see in the first half and the second half. It's not like a major difference, but I do think it has a couple of points differentiation based on that hardware platform. This is, overall, very consistent, once again, with our model. Revenue growth, margin expansion on mix to software and productivity and improved usage of our cash to drive investments, acquisition and our balance sheet for share repurchase. Now like all years, we're going to acquire and we're going to divest businesses. We're going to invest in market opportunities and we're going to drive productivity wherever it's more challenging. We're going to rebalance our workforce to opportunities and skills aligned with our key investments and hire to drive in those growth initiatives. When you look at workforce rebalancing, I think it should be roughly consistent with what we've seen over the last 4 years. More specifically, I think, it would be more like 2010. Once again, if there's a charge associated to that, it would be offset above net income. But you put that all together, and I think we have a good hand as we enter 2012.

The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Mark, you highlighted on this call a number of important areas that IBM is taking share, which highlights the expanding distribution and the focus on value-add offerings. You also commented that the return on recent acquisitions has been the best you've seen in some time. So I wonder why not be more aggressive on acquisitions in 2012 relative to what was a pretty quiet year in 2011 and, frankly, even potentially get more aggressive than you were in 2010 when valuations were high in some sectors.
Mark Loughridge
Well, I think that's a very fair question. I still think the best guide over the longer period, Katy, we had said that in the 2015 time frame that we saw about $20 billion of acquisition spend. In that specific calendar time frame, we've only done about $1.8 billion. I still think the $20 billion is a realistic number. We are pretty tough on the financial returns in the cases. We're very, very tough on that. If it doesn't make very strong financial sense then we're either going to hold or we're going to walk. And there have not been exceptions to that rule, at least since I've been in the job. Consequently, we're there to perform against those. Now when the market gets more reasonable on a price level, we'll move in, in a bigger way, and when it gets pricier, we’ll peel back. In 2010, I thought prices were pretty reasonable. We had a lot of good candidates. We did 17 acquisitions, as I'll remind you. Things got a little frothier as we went into 2011. We did pull back, but we still had some very strong acquisitions. You've seen in the last -- in the fourth quarter, we had about 4 acquisitions. We've already done 3 this year. Within that, one aspect of that improving performance, I think, and I can't give you a precise variance analysis on it, but we've built a tool with research based on the analytic performance in all of the acquisitions that we've done since 2000. You've got to imagine that's a pretty rich database to drive that. So now when we go in and do due diligence in an acquisition, we use that analytical tool, this is called ""eating your own cooking,"" we use that analytical tool to improve our performance. So when you do an acquisition, you’re going to put that team on the ground, we now know the 5 or 6 key elements that we have to actually -- absolutely nail to perform against that, and we can hit those very, very quickly. Analytics, I think, has really paid off for us. But I do think the acquisition play is a good one, and I do think the market’s in a more reasonable position.

The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.
David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Mark, if I understood your commentary earlier about the backlog in Services, you've got about visibility on 2% growth in the Services business going into the year. And if that's true, the transactional business, I assume, on the margin is a big component of making up any difference over and above that. And now that we're anniversary-ing the issues that you were having in Japan, as well as public services, do we have some tailwinds in that transactional business as we get into 2012?
Mark Loughridge
Well, I -- when you look at the -- your view of tailwinds, I don't know if I would call them tailwinds. But against the way we kind of plumbed the plan, I do think they present some opportunities. So if you look at -- let's discuss that, kind of on the GBS base of business. On the GBS base of business, they were impacted in the year, and I think it was -- it would have been very difficult for them to offset this because about 1/3 of their business is in public sector in Japan. And with the difficulties in both of those, if you airlift them out of their results, in the fourth quarter, GBS did about 9% growth. So a bit of an acceleration off the 8% that they would have done on that basis in the first, second and third quarter. So we exit the year, I think, with the balance of that business performing pretty well. As we go into 2012, we should start to wrap on the public sector performance. We should also start to wrap on the issues in Japan. And so I do think that gives us an opportunity to improve performance, but we haven't banked on that as we built our budgets and our structure.

The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Mark, considering the margin improvements in both Software and Services, I want to get a sense if you could help us understand the buckets of cloud, Smarter Planet and Business Analytics? You talked about or referenced a really nice growth there in terms of revenue. How are the 3 key components of hardware, services and software represented in those buckets? Are they similar to the corporate average? Are they below or above? Because I'm trying to get a sense of as those 3 initiatives continue to grow faster and faster, they're more service- and software-laden, are you going to get even a better margin momentum story down the road?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, well, that's a very, very good question because if you look at the construct underneath that, boy, I can't tell you how structured we are on those growth initiatives, GMU, Smarter Planet, Business Analytics, cloud computing. And within that, if you look at -- let's take consulting and consulting's role. Is consulting's role in those simply to provide consulting content and value add? That's part of it, but it’s also to create the entrée for our software value add and our hardware content as well. So if you look at that construct behind Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and cloud computing, more than half of that is software. And that's what we're looking for. More than half of it is software. Software, again, you can see this segment, as well as anybody, that's come in at very high PTI margins, very high value add to our customer set. Some of the plays we've called there on security, on commerce, commerce has been a very, very -- Smarter Commerce is very, very successful for us in that blend of our organic spend and the acquisitions that we've done. So that's the objective, good question. Big software mix within that, over half of the revenue, software revenue.

Next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montréal.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Mark, I wanted to ask on services-related questions. Number one, at the end of 2012 -- the backlog runoff charge is helpful. At the end of 2012, would you anticipate that the backlog that you report will be higher or lower based on the runoff schedule? And I know that backs into some of the signings. And related to that, is -- the transaction businesses were a little bit weaker for IBM this quarter and I think have been weaker for all the service providers. And so to get back to a previous question, with the backlog runoff, can you do constant currency growth in services, more broadly if 2% to 3%, if there is a persistent weakness in the transactional side?
Mark Loughridge
Well, I think, actually, you look at the fourth quarter performance, I thought we did pretty well on the transactional content. I think to pick one, we entered 2012 with our stronger positions in our ITS transactional services as we go into the year. And actually our transactional backlog on a year-to-year basis was pretty strong. So one way to kind of look at that is if you look at that backlog runout that we described in the presentation, last year, had we analyzed that, more of the backlog runout would have been driven by our outsourcing business. This year, consistent with year-to-year dynamics in backlog, more of that backlog runout is driven by the transactional businesses. So I think it's part of -- it's reflected in both of those metrics, which are quite consistent. And once again, I think it does put us in a good position as we enter 2012.

The next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I wanted to go back to Bill's question earlier, Mark, and just ask you specifically whether you've seen any of the lengthening of sales cycles or additional levels of approval that one of your major competitors on the software side talked about during the December quarter. And then maybe just a comment about -- I think you've talked about this a little bit, but how you feel about the pipeline for Services and Software as we head into Q1?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. When you look at the overall -- let's start with the pipeline. When you look at the overall pipeline going into 1Q for Software and Services, I mean, I think they looked pretty good. The Software has a very strong set of offerings. And I think the strength and momentum we've seen in the offerings is most conservative. On the Services side, I mean, we've already had a very large win-back from one of our competitors that's driven pretty good quarter-to-date performance in our business. So I feel pretty good about those. As far as lengthening of the sales cycle and more approvals, I do think people and CFOs are cautious about their business, and they want to make sure they have the right processes engaged. And we did see that. But on the other hand, they're also looking for value to apply to the business equations. And I think if you can bring real value to apply to those business equations, it puts you in a stronger position. So that's why I think, in our fourth quarter, we saw a pretty good performance in our business, especially in those key investment categories and our software business.

Next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.
Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research
Mark, in your prepared remarks, you talked about share gains in just about all the key software brands. And you specifically mentioned an 80% win rate in bake-off situations. Can you remind us what this had been in prior quarters? And specifically, can you share any details from your win-loss analysis versus Oracle and whether anything is changing there?
Mark Loughridge
Well, I mean if you look at -- let's look at this from a couple of perspectives. One way we can look at it is from the Netezza perspective. Now Netezza turned out to be a very, very strong acquisition for us. In fact, the revenue was up 70%. We were sold out. I mean, we could have done even better on Netezza but we sold out the box. Behind that, in each of the proof of concepts that we ran versus Oracle, we won 85% of the time. So that's a pretty strong statement. Now let's look at it from another dimension. Let's look at it from pSeries performance. If you look at the competitive displacements that we had in the quarter, we had 350 competitor displacements, driving $350 million. That's 1,000 for the year and $1 billion for the year. $350 million -- or 350, that's the best quarter we've had since we started tracking this in 2006. And if you look at the content between those competitive displacements, 60% came from Hewlett-Packard, and 40%, the balance, was primarily driven from Oracle.

The last question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners.
Robert Cihra - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division
I was hoping to ask a question on the premium growth from your growth markets in Q4, but also sort of within the context of your 2015 roadmap. And I guess 2 things, one is you’re only 1/5 of the way into that roadmap, but I'm wondering if you feel like ahead of that plan to reaching 30% of revenue. And then more specifically, is that dependent on kind of emerging market economies simply outgrowing mature economies? Or is there a lot of IBM specifics that go into it in terms of your investments there in footprint, OpEx, CapEx, et cetera?
Mark Loughridge
Okay. Well, if you look at the growth market performance for the quarter, as we said, 8 points better than the majors for the year or 10 points better. At 10 points better, we did 10 points better this year, we did 10 points better last year but the prior 2 years were both 8 points better. So that differential, it's hard to look at that differential and not conclude it's relatively improving for the last few years and driving our mix equation. So we do feel pretty good about that mix performance. What I really feel good about is the profit performance behind that growth because they are a big contributor. So if you look at the performance that we saw in the quarter, at their relative mix, they drove about 42% of the profit growth that we had on a growth -- so that was a very strong contributor. If you look at the dependencies there, number one, I think we bring a lot of value to those geographies. So if you look at that value construct, I mean, a play like Smarter Planet plays in a very big way in our growth markets. Secondly, we're able to roll out with our structural advantage on the back-office, the central structure of the business, we can move into new cities without recreating that back-office. It's as if you have a -- kind of a -- for lack of a better word, a branch in a box and you plug in the back-office. And the back-office is running the systems across the geographies. I think that gives us an advantage. And then third, not to be -- plus we have a very good reputation, very good reputation and very good brand image in our growth markets as well. So we feel pretty confident in that play. So a lot of good questions. Let me wrap up now, just make a few comments. We just delivered a great quarter to cap off what I think was a great 2011. For the year, we generated 7% revenue growth to almost $107 billion. We expanded margin in line with our model and delivered $13.44 of operating EPS, which is our ninth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Looking forward to 2012, we see good opportunity in our growth markets and in our higher value solutions like analytics and Smarter Planet, where we believe our enterprise clients will continue to focus. And we'll leverage the strength and flexibility of our business model, driving productivity, improving mix and using our capital effectively. So this all supports our expectation of at least $14.85 of operating earnings per share for the year. That's up 10.5% and keeps us right on track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. So thanks for joining us, and now it's back to work.

Mark Loughridge
Thanks for joining us today. In the third quarter, we drove 8% revenue growth, expanded gross pretax and net operating margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $3.28, up 15% year-to-year. We're increasing our full year 2011 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $13.35. This is up $0.10 from our previous view of at least $13.25 and up $0.35 from the beginning of the year. 
Looking at the drivers of our performance, our software profit was up 12%, driven by Key Branded Middleware revenue growth of 17%. Hardware profit growth of 8% was led by Power Systems, where we had outstanding revenue growth and margin performance. We're continuing to drive competitive displacements and extend our share gains in UNIX.
Services delivered strong profit growth, with pretax income up 13% in both segments. Services revenue growth was again led by growth markets, up double digits at constant currency. Our growth markets' performance was terrific across all of our segments. Revenue from these countries was up 19% or 13% at constant currency. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth in growth markets, with double-digit revenue growth in 40 countries. Consistent with our model, growth markets, along with our other key growth initiatives, are driving our revenue performance.
Turning to profit, we expanded operating gross margin by 0.5%. The improvement was broad-based, with strong performance in systems and technology. With 10% growth in operating pretax income and 9% growth in operating net income, we expanded pretax and net operating margins as well.
Our third quarter operating tax rate reflects an updated view of the full year rate to 24.5%. The rate in the quarter is up 60 basis points year-to-year, which impacted EPS growth by $0.03. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.28, which is up 15% year-to-year. Our strong earnings performance resulted in $3.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and in the last 12 months we've generated over $16 billion of free cash flow. And we've delivered significant returns to shareholders, with over $4 billion in share repurchase and dividends this quarter and more than $18 billion over the last year.
Now I'll get into third quarter details, starting with revenue by geography. Our geographic performance was again led by the growth markets in North America. I'll discuss the geographic results on a local-currency basis. Revenue in our major market countries was essentially flat year-to-year. The U.S., our largest market, was up 4%, and Canada was up 7%, driven by continued momentum in our software business and great performance in Power Systems. In Europe, we had good growth in Spain, which was up 9%; and in the U.K., up 5%. We've now had 8 consecutive quarters of constant currency revenue growth in the U.K.
Our growth markets, again, had fantastic performance, outpacing the majors by 12 points. With 13% revenue growth, this is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in share gains compared to a strong third quarter last year. Performance was broad-based. As I mentioned, we had double-digit growth in 40 growth market countries including each of the BRICs. Our success is broad-based from a segment perspective as well. In fact, growth markets led the performance in each segment, with strong growth and expected share gains in GTS, GBS, Software and Systems and Technology. Within growth markets, we're expanding into new countries and territories to reach new clients and enterprises. And so far this year, we've opened over 80 new branches.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. The total services revenue growth rate was 8% or 2% at constant currency. This constant currency growth was consistent with the second quarter growth rate. We had great year-to-year performance in the growth markets, with double-digit constant currency revenue growth and expanding margins. Our software business had a great quarter. Growth was led by our Smarter Commerce and business analytics initiatives. In Systems and Technology, we had double-digit growth in our growth markets, while major markets declined. As I mentioned earlier, we had terrific revenue growth and margin expansion in Power Systems. While our System z mainframe wrapped on new product introductions a year ago.
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross margin improved 1.5 points, with growth across our major segments. The largest contribution came from Systems and Technology, which was up over 3 points, driven by improvements in POWER, System z and System x.  
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was up 12%, with over 1/2 of the growth attributed to currency from both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed 3 points of the increase. Because this is a view of our operating expense, it excludes the impact of amortization. Our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up 2 points. 
I'll comment on a couple of expense items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. First, we had a $60 million decrease in investment gains, which increased our expense year-to-year. This is driven by a gain in the third quarter of last year associated with the disposition of a joint venture.
Another driver of expense growth is the impact of our hedging programs. We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. With the year-to-year change in currencies, hedging programs generated losses in the quarter, which mitigate the translation benefits elsewhere in the P&L. Of the roughly $250 million year-to-year impact in cost and expense from these programs, $190 million is an expense, almost entirely in other income and expense. 
So now let me go into the segments. The 2 services segments delivered $15.2 billion in revenue, up 8% as reported and up 2% at constant currency. Both services segments grew pretax profit 13%, and combined pretax margin was up 80 basis points year-to-year. Total outsourcing revenue was $7.1 billion, up 9% as reported or 3% at constant currency. Our total transactional revenue of $6.1 billion was up 7% or 1% at constant currency.
Overall growth was again driven by strength in the growth markets, with constant currency revenue up double digits in both the outsourcing and transactional businesses. Total backlog in the quarter was $137 billion, up almost $2.5 billion year-to-year. 
Now let's move on to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.3 billion. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 9% or 3% at constant currency, and we gained share again this quarter. Growth was led by our performance in the growth markets, with revenue up 10% at constant currency. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 11% or 5% at constant currency. This 2 point improvement over the last quarter's constant currency growth rate was driven primarily by the major markets. In ITS, we had strong performance in our software support services and business continuity and resiliency services. The growth in our higher-value offerings helped drive overall gross margin expansion for ITS. Global Technology Services pretax income was up 13% year-to-year and pretax margin improved to 15.9%. Margin expansion was driven by improved gross profit in Strategic Outsourcing, ITS and maintenance. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.8 billion. Application Outsourcing revenue was up 11% or 5% at constant currency, led by strong performance in the growth markets. Consulting and Systems Integration, which includes consulting, AMS systems integration and the U.S. federal business grew 4% as reported and was down 1% at constant currency. Declines in Japan and public sector continued to weigh on good performance in the remainder of the C&SI business. They impacted our C&SI constant currency growth rate by 7 points this quarter. In fact, if you look at total GBS revenue, excluding Japan and public sector, revenue was up high-single digits at constant currency for the third consecutive quarter. Global Business Services did a great job driving profit and margin again this quarter. Pretax profit was up 13% year-to-year, with pretax margin up 1 point to 15.4%. This is the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion.
Now let me close the services discussion with a few comments on the key drivers of services contribution to the  2015 roadmap. First, we're building a great services business in the growth markets, with strong revenue growth across our outsourcing, transactional and maintenance businesses, good backlog growth and expanding margins, with gross margin nearly 3 points higher than the majors. Second, we continue to get good traction in all of our key plays: cloud, business analytics and Smarter Planet. And finally, we continue to expand margin and drive solid profit growth. We're seeing the benefits of mixing into higher value offerings in the yield from our productivity initiatives, consistent with our long-term objectives.
Software had another great quarter, with revenue of $5.8 billion, up 13% or 8% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware grew 17%, gaining share for the 16th straight quarter and extending our leadership of the middleware market. Segment pretax income was up 12% to $2.2 billion. 
Turning to brand performance, WebSphere had another terrific quarter, with over 50% revenue growth, driven by both our base business and acquisitions. Revenue from our Smarter Commerce offering more than doubled year-to-year, as we bring together our WebSphere Commerce business with the Sterling, Unica and Coremetrics acquisitions. Business process management, which helps our customers drive new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the business, grew nearly 50%.
Information Management was up 12% and gained share. I'll comment on 2 key contributors to this performance. First, Netezza, which grew 36% over last year. Since its introduction in 2009, the Netezza appliance has won over 80% of the head-to head proof of concepts against competition. Second, data management. Last month, Gartner reported that IBM is the market leader in data archiving, Master Data Management and data integration. Both Netezza and Data Management are key components of IBM's business analytics growth initiative, which grew double digits again this quarter. Tivoli software grew 8%, driven by strong performance in storage management. Lotus grew 6% year-to-year, with strong growth in our social business offerings. And with 7% growth, Rational gained share. Overall, software had another powerful quarter, with revenue up 13%, driven by branded middleware growth, gross profit margin up 0.2 point and pretax income up 12%.
Going forward, we continue to expand our software business both organically and through acquisitions, with a focus on higher growth segments such as Smarter Commerce, business analytics and security. We closed on the acquisition of i2 earlier this month. i2 helps customers in the public and private sectors address crime, fraud and security threats. We expect to close on the acquisition of Algorithmics and of Q1 Labs later this year. 
Algorithmics expands IBM's capabilities in the financial services industry by helping clients quantify, manage and optimize their risk exposure across a range of financial risk domains. Q1 Labs helps clients more intelligently secure their enterprises by applying analytics to correlate information from key security domains and creating security dashboards for their organizations.
Moving on to Systems and Technology, revenue was $4.5 billion, up 4% or 1% at constant currency, and profit was up 8%. Growth markets grew 12% at constant currency. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in growth markets. Gross profit margin expanded 3.4 points to almost 40%, driven by margin expansion in POWER, System z and System x. 
Now let me take you through the brands. Systems z revenue declined 5%, and MIPS were down 11%, as we wrapped on the successful launch of our zEnterprise 196 in the third quarter of last year. Since the z 196 started shipping a year ago, we've added over 80 new System z customers, with more than 30% of these in the growth markets.
We had great performance in POWER, up 15% year-to-year. We've gained share in each of the last 14 quarters, and now, for the third consecutive quarter, IBM's strong performance accounted for all of the UNIX industry's growth. We continued our success and competitive takeouts. This quarter, we had over 250 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $225 million of business. Roughly half of this business came from HP and the other half from Oracle/Sun. 
Storage hardware revenue grew 8% year-to-year, with constant contributions from both disc and tape. When combined with storage software, total storage grew 12% this quarter. System x revenue grew 1%. System x revenue in growth markets was up 15% at constant currency. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in growth markets. Overall, System and Technology revenue grew 4%, gross profit margin expanded over 3 points and pretax income was up 8%.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $300 million year-to-year. The year-to-year improvement was in line with our net income growth. Through the first 3 quarters, our free cash flow of $7.6 billion was flat versus last year. Excluding the impact of income tax settlement payments, which I discussed in the first quarter, year-to-date free cash flow would've been up $800 million. Our collections continue to be very strong. 
Looking at the uses of our cash through the first 3 quarters, we returned $14 billion to shareholders. We paid over $2.5 billion in dividends, and we spent $11.5 billion in share repurchase where we bought back 69 million shares. At the end of the third quarter, we had $5.2 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash balance of $11.3 billion. Total debt was over $30 billion, of which $22.8 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7:1. Our nonfinancing debt was $7.4 billion, with a debt-to-cap of 28%. With this amount of leverage, we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility. Our balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Our revenue growth of 8% contributed $0.22 to our earnings growth. Our solid gross margin expansion more than offset a higher level of expense and an increase in tax rate. Gross margin drove $0.23 of EPS growth, while we had a $0.17 impact from expense and a $0.03 impact from a higher tax rate. All in, margin expansion contributed $0.03, and a lower share count contributed $0.18 consistent with last quarter. So this quarter, our EPS growth was driven by revenue growth, margin expansion and share repurchases.
When we introduced our 2015 roadmap, we identified 4 key initiatives that would deliver most of our revenue growth over the next few years. We've had terrific performance in these growth plays. Our growth market strategy is driving powerful growth and share gains. So far, this year, these countries grew 20% or 13% at constant currency and contributed over half of IBM's constant currency revenue growth. In business analytics, we're helping our customers manage and optimize tremendous amounts of data. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our business analytics revenue is up 19%, reflecting a strong portfolio of integrated software and consulting capabilities. Our enterprise cloud initiatives help clients improve the economics of IT. Year-to-date, we have already doubled last year's cloud revenue as we extend our offerings. In fact, just last week, we announced new and enhanced cloud capabilities for service delivery, the data center and business model innovation. 
We continue to have strong growth in our Smarter Planet offerings. Through the first 3 quarters, we're up 50% over last year. This quarter, growth was again driven by solutions in our retail and telecom industries, and our Smarter Commerce initiative is gaining momentum. So we're leveraging our growth plays while expanding margin. For both the quarter and year-to-date, we've expanded our net operating margin by 20 basis points.
At the same time, we're driving investment of R&D, capital and acquisition spend, along these same growth themes, from optimized systems to business analytics to Smarter Commerce and Smarter City. So now through the first 3 quarters of 2011, we've delivered revenue growth of 9% or 4% at constant currency, operating pretax income growth of 10%, net income growth of 11% and operating EPS growth of 18%.
We've generated over $7.5 billion of free cash flow and returned $14 billion to shareholders. With 3 quarters behind us, we're once again increasing our full year 2011 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $13.35, a good start towards our 2015 roadmap. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I'd ask you to refrain for multipart questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Mark, I guess currency is going to be a less of a positive impact in the fourth quarter and should revenue slow markedly, could you remind us of your cost levers, not only for the quarter, but then maybe some that will continue in to next year? And if you want to quantify any, that will be great.
Mark Loughridge
Well, Ben, I think when you look at the overall levers, to use your terminology, I would start with the overall business model. The business model is a balanced set of operational degrees of freedom from our base revenue performance, mixing into higher revenue sources like our growth markets unit, revenue from our acquisition base, mixing into higher profit elements of our business, continuing to drive productivity with our spend takeout initiatives and using our balance sheet to both repurchase our own shares and pay dividends to our customer set. And those same degrees of freedom we apply right down through the business units. So as we looked at the business as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year, we'll certainly take advantage of those alternatives. Now I'd also remind you, especially as we talked about the 2015 model, that we are driving our business units towards a higher level of revenue performance. In the spend takeout, you remember we have modeled it in the at least case that we drive $3 billion of spend takeout to the bottom line. But I can assure you we are chasing $8 billion, but there's another $5 billion of opportunity there. And lastly, if we achieve our free cash flow objectives by 2015, we'd have another $40 billion of financial flexibility. So those all give us additional options. But I would come back and step back looking at the fourth quarter and the full year. I think we've got a pretty good hand. As I look at our performance outside of STG, which has a very difficult compare, we should see pretty good performance on a revenue and profit base at the balance of our businesses. GTS should have a similar quarter in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. GBS should have an improved performance in the top line. And our software base of business has a very strong pipeline, and they should be running for a similarly strong performance in the fourth quarter compared to the third. The issue really is on STG. They just have a massive compare. I mean, they have 22% last year. So on an absolute dollar basis, we're going to have a great quarter on our STG business, sort of a lot of revenue, lot of profit, a lot of free cash flow, but they have a very tough compare.
Operator
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
I guess this is somewhat a follow-up to the first one. I'm wondering if you can comment at all on what you're seeing in the macro environment and now we should be thinking about your revenue growth in light of that and the tough compares you face. So I asked that because I see several things, your major markets growth rate decelerated meaningfully. It was flat this quarter. Financial Services, after quarters of 8%, 10%, 15% in the last 3 quarters, decelerated meaningfully this quarter. And you commented on how public was a big drain in consulting. So there definitely seems to be some areas that are less strong. Overall, you grew 2.8% in revenues this quarter, including acquisitions and your comparisons get a lot tougher. So I guess the question is: Can you comment on the macro, and can you comment on the things that you're doing? And given the comparisons, shouldn't we be expecting constant currency growth rate to actually decelerate going forward rather than accelerate?
Mark Loughridge
Now if you look at the -- I think that's a very good question. I'm going to start from where I left off the last question. First of all, as we look at the fourth quarter, it should look very similar to the third quarter outside of the STG compare. So just to reiterate, GTS should have a very similar quarter. GBS should have improved revenue performance in the low- to mid-single digit, and software should have another strong quarter base in the pipeline that we can see. I don't expect STG to be able to overcome the compare given that they grew 22% last quarter, but they should do -- book a lot of business, a lot of profit and a lot of cash, as I said. But I want to make very clear, though, as we look at the performance in the third quarter, really, the performance on the software side and the services side was very consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. And we're driving those businesses for profit achievement using the degrees of freedom that they have in their individual business models just as we do at the IBM level. So just to recount, I mean GTS, 13% profit growth in the quarter; GBS, 13% profit growth in the quarter, 20% year-to-date; GTS is 13% year-to-date; Total Services has 15% profit growth on a year-to-date basis. Even in STG, that began to wrap on the mainframe cycle, drove 8% profit growth in the third quarter, and we had very strong performance once again out of our software base of business. So I think it's going to be another quarter where we'll be driving for similar, if not improved, level of performance in the software services side of the house. STG does have a difficult compare, but I think we've got a strong book of business. Now to your other question, let's look at it on a geographic standpoint. I mean, first of all, the U.S. was up 4%, Canada was up 7%, Latin America was up 17%. Within the overall growth markets unit, it was up 13%. I mean 13% is very, very strong, a very strong quarter for us. You mentioned the FSS in your question as well. Well, let's look at FSS. FSS grew 10% in the third quarter compared to IBM at 8%, so a little better. If you look underneath FSS, they grew 14% in GMU and 16% in GMU on a year-to-date basis, and those growth rates are at constant currency. So I wouldn't look at the overall Financial Services sector through a major market lens. I mean some of the issues we're all reading about in the periodicals that affect the Financial Services sector in the major markets, we don't see that in the growth markets. We see a very strong book of business growing in a very rapid rate in margin and profit opportunities for us that are very powerful. Again, it's growing 14% FSS and GMU in the quarter and 16% on a year-to-date basis.
Operator
The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Well, I hate to add -- ask another macro-sensitive question, but I think it's certainly top of mind for investors. Obviously, I think some of the comments you've made in the past few minutes are all coming to the same point, which is that your model tends to be supported by a fairly healthy dose of perpetuity, revenue and profit streams. But when we look at the near term, the fourth quarter can obviously be fairly sensitive to transactional volumes, particularly within the hardware segment. Can you understand -- can you help us understand how we should think about recent macro economic uncertainty and normal seasonality for the fourth quarters that we don't get off-base when we're forecasting in the near term for you?
Mark Loughridge
Well, when you look at the year, at $13.35, it's a very strong year, up 14%. That 14% is ahead of the growth rate required for our business model, that's 11%. So it's already ahead of that trajectory. Now I will agree to some degree to your point that we are less than 90 days away from the end of the year, so there's probably less variability around that at least $13.35, but that is an at-least number that we see for the year. And again, going underneath this on a more macro basis, we do see a very good pipeline in the fourth quarter for our software business. I think they had a very good quarter in the third, and they've got a very good pipeline to extend that performance into the fourth. As I said earlier, we see very similar performance for GTS as we go from the third to the fourth, and we can see improved performance on our GBS business growing to low to mid-single-digit growth rate. As well, a lot of those same characteristics that help us expand margin so substantially within the quarter are going to be able to -- we'll take advantage of those as well as we go into the fourth quarter.
Operator
The next question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I also wanted to ask one question on the macro environment, this time focusing on the services business. Are you seeing anything in terms of sales cycles elongating, competitors getting more aggressive? Any of the more anecdotal indicators that would suggest things are getting more difficult in the services side of your business, any color there?
Mark Loughridge
No, I don't think I would say that. I mean, if we look at the services base of business, as I said, from a GTS side going into the fourth quarter, we would expect that GTS would have a similar quarter in the fourth quarter to what they had in the third. I guess from a macro standpoint, we could talk a little more about GBS. I mean, on a GBS basis, one thing from a macro position to remember, they have kind of an outside distribution of their business in Japan and public sector. In fact, within GBS, well over or just over 1/3 of their business is in Japan and public sector. So when you look at the GBS performance, I think it's fair to look at how do they perform outside of those 2 areas of business. And if you extract Japan and public sector from GBS performance, you'd see that the revenue in the third quarter was up 13% for the balance of the business. The revenue for GBS on a year-to-date basis was up 13%. And if you look at that performance on a constant currency basis, it was roughly identical 8%, 8%, 8% for the first, second and third quarter for sustained performance. So I think outside of those areas that have proved difficult for global economies, GBS really performed pretty well. And I would also add, when you look at those 2 areas, we indicated at the beginning of the year that we thought at the IBM level, we would be able to continue to overcome those, and we demonstrated that in the third quarter. So I think going forward, we should still be able to overcome the overall economic issues that we see in Japan given the natural disaster that they suffered underneath and the government issues that we see and read about that I would restrict. That's a major market phenomena, not a GMU phenomena. But at the GBS level, given that it's over 1/3 of their business, I think it's fair to extract that by looking at their performance outside of that. And I'd remind you that both services have year-to-date profit growth of 13% in GTS, 20% in GBS and 15% overall.
Operator
The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
This growth in System z revenue growth decelerated a little earlier and more than I would've expected. Can you just talk about whether you saw particular regions or verticals of customers that pulled away from those larger deals?
Mark Loughridge
Well, I would interpret it more as a kind of characteristics mainframe cycle. If you look at it versus the last 3 mainframe cycles, this falls right in the middle of that. So I would explain it, Katy, that really this is a fairly consistent mainframe cycle. Now the one area I guess we could comment on, if you look at Europe, actually, on the services and software side in Europe, the third quarter revenue performance is actually stronger than it was in the first half of the year. The issue in Europe really was that they had the STG, the mainframe wrap, and some countries in Europe like France, tend to have a very high adoption rate on a mainframe cycle, and consequently, France was flat. But even Europe, I wouldn't wrap into a one homogenous view of country performance. As an example, at the total IBM level, Spain was up 9%, and we could see that 9% was driven by the linkages Spain has built with Latin America banking industry. The U.K. was up 5% now for the eighth quarter in a row. In the U.K., it's really the services business driving the investment themes in Smarter Planet business analytics. That is accounted for. So Europe is not one homogenous grouping of countries, but I do think you'll see in the performance that even though there was a year-to-year issue on the compare given the announcement of mainframe and some faster adoption cycles in Europe affecting the STG side, actually, the services and software growth rate were stronger in the third quarter than they were in the first half of the year.

The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montréal.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Mark, I want to go to services, if I could, as well. Could you talk a little bit about why backlog was down sequentially. It's the first time I think in 5 years, the only exception was the '08 period where backlog is down in September, and it doesn't appear that currency was a driver. So can you talk a little why it was down? And then secondarily, given your comments on both GPS -- GBS rather and GTS, how we should be thinking about the growth of backlog as we look out over the December quarter?
Mark Loughridge
Okay. If you look at the quarter-to-quarter backlog performance, that differential, in fact, was entirely driven by 2 sources. It was dominated by currency within the backlog, number one. And then there also was some effect of seasonality in the backlog, but those 2 accounted for all of that differential.
Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
What would be different -- sorry, Mark. What would be different about seasonality in this particular September versus, say, the last 5 years?
Mark Loughridge
Actually, if you'd look at it over the last 4 years, you'd see that it's actually very -- a portion of it that was very consistent with that. So again, the delta was, in fact, dominated by currency, but the balance was, in fact, very consistent with the seasonal view of the world. Now on a backlog basis, the other point that I would make is when I made the comments that we see improved performance on the GBS side of the business going into the fourth quarter, all mid single-digit revenue growth, that backlog growth on a year-to-year basis, that 137 up $2.4 billion. All of that $2.4 billion can be attributed to the transaction side of the businesses. And that transaction, the balance of it outside of outsourcing is driven by transaction maintenance, and the big driver of that performance is the transaction business. That's why we feel that we have a good hand going forward in the GBS business since you see improved growth rates out of the backlog.
Operator
The next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America.
Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Mark, can you delve into the System p in Power Systems a little bit more? You've obviously been gaining share there for quite a while now. How much longer do you think this can go on, and can you describe the sort of competitive dynamics that you're seeing there?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Well, as you saw in the results, our P series or our POWER series had 15% revenue growth in the quarter. And I'll tell you, they had a likewise very strong performance in their margin in the quarter as well. In fact, if you look underneath that 15%, the high end of P series grew about 50%, so really strong performance. Now on your point on the industry, I mean we gained 6 points a share in the quarter, which is strong performance, and that's now 14 quarters in a row of share gain. I think more interesting underneath that, IBM once again in the third quarter drove all of the unit's market share growth, all of it. So I think this has real opportunity to extend as we go into the fourth quarter in 2012. I'd also say, point out underneath this, we did take about $225 million from a competition this quarter, pretty balanced between HP and Sun on a kind of a 50-50 basis. So it's a strong competitive platform for us as well. But I think most impressive, at least for me, and I know this is going to be a very CFO view of the world, but you're talking to a CFO. So if you look underneath that, very strong revenue performance, but also very strong marketing performance at the same time.
Operator
The next question from Louis Miscioscia with Collins Stewart.
Louis R. Miscioscia - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division
Thanks, Mark, for being very helpful, a lot of color on things. Maybe you could give us some more of a breakdown on Financial Services and public sector  maybe from an industry vertical perspective, for example, there's, obviously, insurance and Financial Services or maybe also a geographic -- both of those will be helpful.
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Let's start -- when you look at the Financial Services sector performance, I want to reiterate some of the points I've already made, but I think they're important. One, with IBM going 8%, the FSS business grew 10%, so better than the average. But I think more interesting is if you look at the growth market's performance in the Financial Services sector, I mean, up 14% in the third quarter on a constant currency basis and up 16% on a year-to-date basis. So just as IBM is rapidly mixing in these growth market businesses, obviously, each of the industries are doing the same, and we do not see the same level of concerns certainly in the Financial Services and banking sector in growth markets that we see in the major markets. Quite contrary, we see a lot of momentum, a lot of opportunity. From an industry standpoint, though, stepping back from Financial Services sector, I'd remind you, we had terrific growth in general business. So this is generally small-, medium-sized business, up 16%. In that industry, that's larger than $5 billion. It's our second largest industry. Likewise, distribution grew 11%, so pretty strong performance in some of our other areas as well. From a breakdown underneath that, I was most impressed with our ability to still drive that customer standpoint in our engagement with the customer base. This turned out to be the sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth with growth in all industries. And as I said, in the growth markets, along with the very powerful performance, the banks are really focused on increasing their service coverage and expanding offerings in business model transformation. So I really want to emphasize that, that growth market potential is substantial.
Operator
The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Mark, just given the sensitivity around the macro environment, I want to come back to software for a moment. You talked in prior quarters about the big pipeline, and you guys definitely delivered in terms of the growth. But I just want to get a sense, if you can help us out here, in terms of the 4Q pipeline or even looking into early 2012, how much of the pipeline relates to new projects that have already started in software at your customers versus new projects that have the green light but you have not started actually rolling out those products? Because I'm concerned here, if we do see new products start to come under pressure because of the macro, those that have not started could be tabled or delayed versus those that have already started. So any sense that you can give us qualitatively will be great.
Mark Loughridge
Yes. First of all, within software, we had a number of deals that we are right on the cusp that rolled over into the fourth quarter. So a pretty strong engagement, and those didn't roll because of some kind of pullback in the businesses, but all of it was just the contract signatures and the negotiation process pulled it over the line. So number one, we start with the pretty strong number of deals that have rolled over. Number two, we also have a lot of opportunity in our current customer set and their structural dynamics and contracts that is growing on a year-to-year basis and is not just dependent on new product content and new product rollout. Now that said, I think we have a very strong set of offerings in that new product content, not only organically, but through our acquisitions. But I certainly wouldn't look at the fourth quarter and say that the fourth quarter is dependent on new products that rolled out.
Operator
The last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.
David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
[Indiscernible] it's clearly been a driver for us in most of the segments, and it's over 20% of the mix.
Patricia Murphy
Sorry, David, can you start again at the beginning of the question?
Mark Loughridge
Can you start again?
David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Sure. It was really a question about the growth markets. It's over 20% of the mix. It's having a fairly dramatic impact on your growth rate across all segments. Can you -- if global economic growth continues to slow, can you remind us of how the growth markets performed back in the '08, '09 time frame? And just help us understand how you'd expect it to trend again if global economic growth is, in fact, slowing.
Mark Loughridge
Yes. I mean, the differential between major market performance and growth market performance over -- since 2008, which is the date I have most clearly in my head here, I mean in 2008, the growth markets grew 8 points more rapidly than the majors. In 2009, they grew 8 points more rapidly again. 2010, they started to move away from the major markets and grew 10 points faster. The first half of this year, they grew 10 points faster. In here, in the third quarter, they grew 12 points faster. If you just looked at it on the relationship of growth markets to major markets, you see kind of an acceleration of that differential. So I think that kind of gives you a characterization. But I also want to add, growth markets, they've got a lot of margin capability within that mix of business. This is big iron rollout that we see, big banks in China, big banking Financial Services sector, telecom sector in India, industrial sector that general business content is a huge part, a huge part of that GMU opportunity set. So if anything, we see expanding potential there. I'd also add that when you look at our growth in the growth markets unit, it's not simply capitalizing on just the growth within the geographies, which we certainly do, but it's also expanding into that next tier city. So on a year-to-date basis, we've opened 80 new offices, 8-0, 80 new offices move into new cities and new capabilities. That is also a very strong suit for us. And then the last point I'd make, when you look at the performance in growth markets, though we did well in the BRICs, and the BRICs are a very strong part of our overall offering, 2/3 of the growth market revenue, almost 2/3, lies outside of the BRICs business, almost 2/3. And that's why we mentioned we had 40 countries with double-digit performance in growth. So this isn't just Brazil, Russia, India, China. It's also a strong way of another 36 countries going double-digit with 2 -- almost 2/3 of that overall growth markets business outside of the BRICs. So let me just make a few comments to wrap up the call. Our third quarter performance reflects the execution of our innovation-based strategy and the strength of the business model. The investments we've made in key growth initiatives are paying off and drove our revenue performance this quarter. Smarter Planet was up 50% year-to-date. Business analytics was up almost 20% year-to-date. Cloud revenue has already doubled -- through the first 3 quarters of the year, has already doubled the full year 2010 results. And, of course, as I just pointed out in the last question, 13% growth in our growth markets, 12 points faster than majors. So all of these initiatives performed really well. We expanded margins, leveraged our cash generation, deliver 15% growth in operating EPS. And with at least $13.35 EPS for the full year 2011, we're on track for a great year and a good start to our 2015 roadmap. So thanks for joining us. Now, as always, it's back to work.

Mark Loughridge
Thanks for joining us today. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 12%, and operating earnings per share of $3.09, up 18% year-to-year. 
With this performance, we're increasing our full year 2011 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $13.25, which is up $0.10 from our previous view of at least $13.15, and up $0.25 from the beginning of the year. The 12% revenue growth was driven by our transactional businesses in hardware and software. Software growth was driven by key branded middleware, which was up 21%. Our systems revenue was up 20%, with strong performance in System z, POWER and System x servers. 
In services, our total backlog increased to $144 billion. That's up almost $15 billion from last year with $13 billion from currency and $2 billion of constant currency performance. Services revenue was up 10%. Within this, growth markets were up 22% or 10% at constant currency. 
Overall, growth markets performance was strong, and revenue from these countries was up 13% at constant currency, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency performance. In fact, we had continued momentum in all of our growth initiatives, growth markets, business analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet. 
Turning to profit. We increased operating pretax income by 10%, and operating net income 11%. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $3.09, which was up 18% year-to-year. 
Our strong earnings performance resulted in $3.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and in the last 12 months we've generated $16 billion of free cash flow. With this strong cash performance, we've delivered significant returns to shareholders, with almost $5 billion in share repurchase and dividends this quarter and almost $19 billion over the last year. 
Now I'll get into the second quarter details, starting with revenue by geography. Our geographic performance was very consistent with the first quarter, with growth markets and North America, once again, providing the biggest lift. I'll discuss the geographic results on a local currency basis. 
Major markets revenue was up 3%. The U.S., our largest market, was up 6%, and Canada was up 11%, driven by momentum in our server and software businesses. In Europe, we had a modest improvement in the year-to-year growth rate, with continued growth in U.K., France and Spain. And this quarter, Germany and Italy returned to growth. Rounding out the G7, in Japan our revenue was down 5%, consistent with the first quarter growth rate. 
Our growth markets continued their very strong performance, outpacing the majors by 10 points. Since we announced our growth markets unit in the beginning of 2008, the revenue growth rate has outpaced the major markets by an average of 9 points, again on a local currency basis. With 13% revenue growth, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and share gains. We also had double-digit growth and share gains in each of the BRIC countries. The combined revenue in the BRICs was up 21%. But our success goes beyond the BRICs, we had double-digit growth in almost 40 growth market countries. 
Our growth is broad-based from a segment perspective, as well. This quarter, we had 24% growth in hardware, with great performance in all system brands. These are high value offerings, not low end content. For example, we have 24 new mainframe customers in growth market countries just since the introduction of the zEnterprise last year. Think of it as planting the flag, which provides a great base for future growth. 
Our software business supports the growth markets build out, with WebSphere providing key underlying infrastructure capabilities. This quarter, WebSphere grew almost 40% in the growth markets.
And our services revenue was up 10%, with terrific performance in both GTS and GBS. Our globally integrated business model allows us to rapidly deploy expertise and capabilities. And with our decades of know-how, we can provide a state-of-the-art IT platform that can scale in fast-growing environments. This is showing up in our backlog. The services backlog in growth markets is up about 50% at actual rates over the last 2 years. 
What's driving this performance? We're continuing to expand into new markets and build out IT infrastructure in support of economic growth. For example, we're expanding our base of business in regions like Africa, where we recently announced the extension of a relationship with Bharti Airtel to provide IT solutions to its employees across 16 African countries; a strategic agreement with Commercial Bank of Ethiopia to modernize core banking systems; and a collaboration agreement with the University of Ghana to foster new entrepreneurial approaches to education and R&D, and to support the adoption of new technologies such as cloud computing and business analytics. 
There's a lot of opportunity for us to capture, and we remain confident that growth markets will approach 30% of IBM's geographic revenue in 2015, and drive half of IBM's revenue growth with strong margin performance.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. The Total Services revenue growth rate was 10% or 2% at constant currency. In services, we had great year-to-year performance in the growth markets, with double-digit constant currency revenue growth and improved gross margin, which was 2 points higher than the services margin in the major markets. 
Systems and Technology had another great quarter, with 17% revenue growth. System z mainframes were up about 60%; System x, up 15%; and Power Systems were up 12%, as we continue to displace competitive systems. Our Software business also grew 17%. Once again, growth was led by our business analytics portfolio, storage management and business integration.
Turning to gross profit. Our operating gross profit margin improved 1.2 points. The largest contribution came from Systems and Technology which was up 5 points, driven by improvements in every system brand and an improving mix. We also expanded gross margins in Software and Global Business Services. 
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was up 20%, with about half of the growth attributed to currency, from both translation and hedging dynamics. Acquisitions over the last 12 months contributed 4 points of the increase. Because this is a view of our operating expense, it excludes the impact of amortization. Our base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up 6 points. 
This quarter, our workforce rebalancing charges were up about $160 million year-to-year, predominantly in Europe. Another driver of expense growth is the impact of our hedging programs. We hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. With the year-to-year change in currencies, hedging programs generated losses this quarter, as compared to gains last year. Of the roughly $300 million year-over-year impact in cost and expense from our hedging programs, approximately $220 million is in expense, including $180 million in other income and expense. Keep in mind that these hedging losses mitigate the translation benefits elsewhere in the P&L. 
So now let me get into the segments. The 2 services segments delivered $15.1 billion in revenue, up 10% as reported and up 2% at constant currency. Global Technology Services grew 11% or 3% at constant currency, and Global Business Services grew 9% or 1% at constant currency. Total outsourcing revenue was $7.1 billion, up 12% as reported, or 3% at constant currency. This was driven by revenue from backlog, which was up 3%, and growth from sales into our existing base accounts. Our total transactional revenue of $6.1 billion was up 9% or 1% at constant currency.
We had outstanding performance this quarter in the growth markets, with constant currency revenue up double digits in both the outsourcing and transactional businesses, driving significant share gains for Total Services in the growth markets. Total backlog was $144 billion, up $15 billion year-to-year, with $13 billion from currency and $2 billion for performance.
Now let's move on to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.2 billion. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 12% or 3% at constant currency. Growth was led by our performance in the growth markets, with revenue up 10% year-to-year at constant currency. We gained share this quarter in total GTS outsourcing in both the growth markets and the major markets. 
Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 11% as reported and 3% at constant currency. Here too, the growth markets were the key driver, with revenue up 14% at constant currency. And revenue for cloud-related services within ITS was up over 200%. Global Technology Services pretax income was up 1% year-to-year. A significant portion of the workforce rebalancing charges this quarter were for services. Normalized for the workforce rebalancing charges, GTS pretax income was up 8%, more in line with revenue.
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.9 billion. Application outsourcing revenue was up 12% as reported and 4% at constant currency. Consulting and Systems Integration, which includes Consulting, AMS systems integration and the U.S. Federal business, grew 7% as reported and was flat at constant currency. 
We continued to have strong performance in our growth initiatives in GBS. In the first half, business analytics revenue was up over 25%. From a geographic perspective, GBS revenue was up 10% at constant currency in the growth markets, with balanced performance in both outsourcing and C&SI, while major markets revenue was down 1% year-to-year due to declines in Japan. 
From a sector perspective, growth was led by distribution, communications and general business. Public sector revenue was down again this quarter, driven by declines in government spending. So although public sector performance had minimal impact on IBM, it did impact the overall GBS growth rate. In fact, excluding public sector, the remainder of GBS grew in the mid-single digit range at constant currency. Global Business Services pretax profit was up 11% year-to-year, with 0.3 point margin expansion. 
So let me close the services discussion with a final comment on the growth markets. We're making a lot of progress in these markets, as we work with businesses to build out the infrastructure required to support future growth. As I mentioned earlier, the backlog in the growth markets was up almost 50% in the past 2 years. That backlog is now approaching 20% of Total Services backlog, and was a big contributor to services growth and the share gains we are seeing in these markets. We see a lot of opportunity ahead of us in the growth markets, which is a key driver of services performance in the 2015 roadmap.
Software had a terrific quarter with revenue of $6.2 billion, which is up 17% year-to-year or 10% at constant currency. Key branded middleware grew 21%, gaining share for the 15th straight quarter and extending our leadership in the middleware market. Key branded middleware accounted for 64% of total software revenue, as we continue to mix into higher growth areas of the business. Segment pretax income was $2.3 billion, up 12% year-to-year. 
Now let me take you through the drivers by brand. WebSphere had another powerful quarter, growing 55% year-to-year and gaining share. Our growth is driven by our base business, as well as acquisitions. For example, business process management grew 30%, driven by the synergies of our combined Lombardi, ILOG and WebSphere products. Smarter Commerce software, which extends our capabilities in B2B integration, commerce solutions and enterprise marketing management, had an excellent quarter, driven by the combination of Sterling Commerce, Unica and Coremetrics acquisitions with our WebSphere Commerce base business. 
Information Management grew 18% year-to-year and gained share. Our distributed database had another terrific quarter with strong double-digit growth. Netezza again performed well, transactional volumes were up 70% year-to-year. IBM Netezza has more than a 10x price/performance advantage over Exadata for running analytics workloads. Since its introduction in 2009, when going head-to-head against competition in proof of concepts, the Netezza appliance has an 80% win rate. This quarter, we've expanded the number of proof of concepts by 60% year-to-year. Information Management provides the foundation of IBM's Business Analytics and Optimization capabilities. In the first half, the software component of business analytics grew over 15%, in support of IBM's overall business analytics growth of more than 20%. 
Tivoli software grew 9% year-to-year, and we held share. Within Tivoli, storage grew nearly 25%. Lotus was up 12% and gained share. This was driven by strong performance from IBM's social business offerings. IDC recently ranked IBM #1 in worldwide market share for social platform software. In summary, software had another very powerful quarter, with revenue up 17% and branded middleware up 21%, gross profit margins up 0.4 point and pretax income up 12%. 
Systems and Technology revenue was $4.7 billion, up 17% year-to-year or 12% at constant currency. This performance was driven by double-digit growth in System z, POWER, System x and Storage, and continued growth in Retail Store Solutions and Microelectronics. Growth markets grew 24% at constant currency with double-digit growth in all brands, while major markets grew 7% at constant currency. Globally, Systems and Technology gained 3 points of market share in total servers, driven by strong increases in System z and POWER. Gross profit margin expanded 5 points year-to-year to 41%, driven by margin expansion across the server and storage portfolio, and pretax margin increased 3.6 points. 
Now let me take you through the brands. System z revenue grew 61% year-to-year and MIPS were up 86%. Over the past 4 quarters, revenue was up 49% year-to-year and MIPS up 59%. This has been the best 4-quarter period in the past 5 years. Since the z196 start shipping in the third quarter of 2010, we've added 68 new System z customers, with more than 1/3 in the growth markets. Last week, we announced the zEnterprise 114 mid-range server, which costs 25% less and delivers up to 25% more performance than the previous z10 business class system. It utilizes up to 14 processors running at 3.8 gigahertz and can consolidate workloads from up to 300 competitive servers on a single z114. 
Power Systems grew 12%, driven by strong growth in both entry and high-end systems. We, again, extended our market leadership this quarter, the 13th consecutive quarter of year-to-year share gain. IBM's strong performance accounted for all of the UNIX industry's 5% growth. We continued our success in competitive take outs. This quarter, we had over 250 competitive displacements, which resulted in over $300 million of business. Roughly 60% of this came from Oracle and 30% from HP. Since the beginning of 2009, IBM drove nearly 2,300 competitive displacements for about $2.3 billion of business. 
Storage hardware revenue grew 10%, driven by disk, which was up 13%. System x revenue grew 15% year-to-year with high-end growth of 26%. System x revenue in the growth markets was up 27% at constant currency. Retail Store Solutions grew 8% and held share, and Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 4% year-to-year. Overall, Systems and Technology had a great second quarter, with revenue up 17%, with strength across the portfolio, gross profit margin of 5 points, pretax income more than doubled and pretax margin up 3.6 points.
Turning to cash flow. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which is up $350 million year-to-year. The year-to-year improvement was in line with our net income growth. Through the first half, our free cash flow of $4.2 billion was down $300 million year-to-year. The decline is driven entirely by an $800 million increase due to income tax settlement payments that I discussed in the first quarter. Excluding this impact, free cash flow would have been up by $0.5 billion year-to-year. Our inventory continues to be well managed and collections remain strong. 
Looking at the uses of cash in the first half, we returned almost $10 billion to shareholders. We spent $8 billion in share repurchase, where we bought back almost 50 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. We took our dividends up 15% in April, and through June we paid out $1.7 billion in dividends. This is the 16th consecutive year that we raised our dividend, and the eighth year in a row of double-digit increases. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash balance of $11.8 billion, up $100 million from the end of last year. Total debt was $29.8 billion. $23.4 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. Our non-financing debt was $6.4 billion, and our non-financing debt-to-capital was 24%, consistent with year end and with a year ago. With this amount of leverage, we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility. Our balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term.
So now let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Our revenue growth of 12% contribute $0.33 to our earnings growth. The $0.04 deterioration from margin reflects a $0.10 year-to-year impact from higher workforce rebalancing charges. And a lower share count contributed $0.18, fairly consistent with last quarter. So this quarter, revenue led our earnings per share performance.
With revenue growth of 12% or 5% at constant currency, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth. This quarter, we had great growth in our transaction businesses and continued success in our 4 key growth initiatives. Our growth markets strategy to expand into new markets, build out IT infrastructure and focus on leadership in specific industries is resulting in solid growth and share gains. Our growth market countries grew 13% at constant currency in the second quarter and the first half, and contributed about half of IBM's geographic revenue growth.
In business analytics, we're helping our customers optimize the massive amounts of data they're dealing with. Through the first half, our business analytics revenue was up over 20%, with good contribution from both software and services. 
In cloud, we had over 2,000 wins year-to-date. In private cloud, our average transaction size has tripled from a year ago. In the first half of 2011, cloud revenue has already exceeded our full year 2010 results, keeping us on track to double our cloud revenue for the year.
Our Smarter Planet revenue growth in the first half was over 50%. This quarter, growth was driven by solutions in our telecom, healthcare and retail industries. We're also gaining traction in our Smarter Commerce initiative launched in the first quarter and ramping our key Smarter Planet services contracts. 
So we have good momentum in our growth plays and are continuing to invest in solutions and the go-to-market capabilities to drive future growth. In the first half of 2011, we've delivered revenue growth of 10% or 5% at constant currency, operating net income growth of 12%, operating EPS growth of 19% and returned $10 billion to shareholders.
So midway through the year, we're increasing our full year 2011 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $13.25 on our way to operating EPS of at least $20 in 2015. 
Now Patricia and I would take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. 
Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Mark, can you walk us through the current competitive landscape in services and outsourcing in particular? You mentioned that you're gaining share here. Where, specifically, do you think you're seeing the most market share momentum, and are you seeing any signs your competitors are responding to that now?
Mark Loughridge
Well, let's look at some of the dynamics that we have in our services business. First of all, when you look at it from a backlog perspective, a really strong backlog quarter for us. Now at a $144 billion, up $15 billion year-to-year, and if you look at that balance on backlog growth, it was pretty strong on both sides, so 11% backlog growth. Within that, though, I'd like to point out that we really had strong performance in GMU. So if you break down that backlog growth in total, up $15 billion, about $7 billion was in major markets, but $8 billion of that $15 billion was in the growth markets. So growth market backlog is now about 20% of the total and over the last 2 years, it's doubled -- it's up 50%, excuse me. So within that 50%, then you look at the margin content, the margin content for Total Services in GMU was 2 points richer than we see in the major markets. So frankly, underneath those dynamics we're seeing real strength as we move into growth markets with a lot of opportunity that comes at good margins given the capability that we bring to the table. If you look overall in the services business, now looking towards the second half of the year, we expect to see yield off of that workforce rebalancing that we did have in the second quarter. And with the yield off that plus the ongoing momentum, because frankly, without that restructuring, workforce rebalancing charge, we had 10% profit growth in services in the second, balance of the 10% revenue. Now getting the yield off that momentum in the second half, we should see margin expansion and double-digit profit growth from our services business. So I think we've got a pretty strong hand, and I would like to reemphasize how encouraging we've seen the performance in GMU.

The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.
Mark, I was wondering if you could comment on pretax margins. I think this was the first time in 15 quarters that they declined year-over-year. I know that currency and acquisitions were a factor, but you have those benefits on the cost side and on the revenue side. You've also mentioned workforce rebalancing several times. Is that really the driver? And if so, can you dimension the size of the workforce rebalancing this quarter relative to other quarters, and where that impact was felt most in the P&L?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. So if you look at it, as you know, as we detailed the business model going through to 2015, within that roadmap, we're looking for a margin expansion on a net income basis, and we're looking for a kind of magnitude of say, 0.3, 0.4 point. In the second quarter, in fact, if you exclude the workforce rebalancing, and within the quarter it was about $175 million, that's up about 160 year-to-year with the bulk of that in the services part of the business, without that effect in the second quarter, we were, in fact, 0.3 point margin expansion on net income. If you take it to the first half, then the first half was expansion of 0.2 point, and without the second quarter restructuring, alone, we would have been up by 0.5 point. Now, again, going into the back half of the year, we'll see some yield against that restructuring. But I feel pretty confident that the margin performance we're seeing in the business is going to be improved as we go into the second half of the year. And frankly, the run rate underneath our performance, I think, is right on the model. So I think it's simply a matter of the workforce rebalancing charges, Toni.
Operator
The next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital
Mark, could you talk a little bit about the financial services vertical? It's 29% of sales the last 2 quarters, still grew 8% at constant currency in the quarter. Obviously, we're all feeling the stock prices and the pressures that are out there in the financial services segment. So could you talk about how IBM is going to continue to grow in that sector maybe throughout the year, what your initiatives are to grow in the financial services and whether you can, and any other detail around that?
Mark Loughridge
Yes. Well, we had really positive performance, as you pointed out, Ben. Financial services, up 17% at actuals. That's the fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth for the financial services sector. And I'd add, when you look at that performance, big placements around the world. The financial services sector is certainly not just deploying by major market participation, some of our biggest banking customers now are, frankly, in the growth markets. Some indicators of that, let's look at the 68 new customers that we brought to the zSeries platform since we introduced zEnterprise, 1/3 of those 68 are in the growth markets. So I think we've got real momentum in the financial services sector. It's a strong play for us. But I would expand that a little bit. We didn't just have strong performance in the financial services sector, up 17%. GB, General Business, was up 16%. Our overall communication sector was up 16%. Those 3 alone account for almost 2/3 of IBM's business. So if you look at the volume of business that we have, exiting the second quarter, we've got real momentum across those largest sectors.
Operator
The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Mark, given the strong growth in IBM transaction businesses, generally, and strong consulting results at your peers, are you surprised by the downtick in constant currency growth within transactional services? I know you mentioned the impacts from government spending, but can you talk about the other factors that drove that deceleration?
Mark Loughridge
Well, let's -- when you look at it on a Total Services basis, we were about 3% constant currency in the first quarter, 2% constant currency in the second quarter. I don't know if I'd call 1% change in the trajectory a deceleration. But if you look forward, really, I would now go back to where we see our sales competitively in our backlog performance. And the backlog performance, once again, we had strong backlog in total, up $15 billion, that's 11% growth, but the transactional backlog was up 16% and the outsourcing backlog was up 9%. Now all of those have different contract lengths and extend over a multiple time periods, but I think it puts us in a pretty good position as we go forward. Now within that, I want to remind ourselves as we look at that performance, the business model is to drive profitability growth, and the GBS business did a great job on profit growth in the quarter. In fact, if you look at Total Services again, adjusting for workforce rebalancing is up 10%, we see that services engine going forward generating double-digit profit growth in the second half. I would also point out that the real mission that we're looking for from our GBS organization, our consulting organization, is to lead our key growth plays. We've already talked about the growth that we've seen in GMU. But I want to reiterate, a big part of their job is to drive that ongoing momentum in Smarter Planet. Smarter Planet was up 50% in the first half. If you look at business analytics, we're up more than 20% in the first half. Cloud computing, we've done as much work in cloud in the first half of this year as we did all of last year. So they are driving that momentum, that's a big play for the IBM Corporation. GBS is on their model on a profitability basis, and we see that yield from the second quarter restructuring moving into margin expansion in the second half.
Operator
The next question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG
Mark, the weaker dollar contributed to 7 points of revenue growth in the quarter. You gave us some details around hedging losses, but can you take or quantify the weak dollar impact on earnings? And in addition, can you comment on how IBM would be impacted if the dollar were to materially strengthen from here?
Mark Loughridge
Yes. Well, Chris, that's a really, really good question. Let me give you an answer on it, but I want to start with kind of the operational aspects of movements in currency. So when you see movements in currency, especially when you see sustained movements over longer periods of time, the competition adjusts, the marketplace adjusts. We use some of that advantage, especially in consecutive quarters of a weakening dollar, to improve our position competitively at the table and, essentially, pass some of that currency advantage to our customers. And I want to keep that operational aspect of competing in a global business in mind as we go through this explanation. When we do the calculation of currency, that's a straight mathematical analysis, translational impact netted for the hedge. When we do that analysis, that really kind of defines the theoretical maximum that currency would be. I don't think it's that much. I know in my business work, when I was pricing PCs, we were adjusting special bids for changes in currency every single day. And we're doing that because competition was doing the same at the table and rolling some of that advantage into their price point to win the business. So if you take that simple mathematical calculation and remember that, that's a theoretical maximum netted for the hedge, that's about $300 million. Now within the quarter, we also had a unique event with the amount of restructuring that we had. Again, $175 million. If you net those 2, the difference of that theoretical maximum on currency netted for restructuring, that's about $125 million. So now with that $125 million in mind, let's return to the operational example I gave of how much is really a pass-through to your customer set to win the deal at the competitive table. Is it 20%? How much benefit did we get on the revenue line? It was about $1.7 billion. Did we pass 20% of that through? Did we pass 30%? Would you pass 1/2 through? I mean, we see it not only in transactional businesses, but we see it in annuity business over sustained periods of time as well. Well, frankly, just to kind of bookend the argument, all you'd need is about 5% to 10% at that $1.7 billion theoretical maximum to be pass-through to your customer set, and that adjustment, alone, would mitigate all of that net benefit of currency relative to a restructuring. If it was more than that 5% to 10%, in fact, the net effect would have been a hurt to the P&L within the period. So I think it's -- Chris, a long answer, but it really is the way currency rolls out, and there are real operational aspects of that, that we need to consider as we analyze the effect.

The next question comes from Scott Craig from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Scott Craig
Mark, I was just wondering if you could go into the software margins and sort of expectations there as you go forward. They were, roughly, flat to slightly down year-over-year, so just curious, you talked about the services margins and the impact from some of the items, what was their impact in there, and sort of your outlook going forward for margin expansion?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Well, if you look at the software businesses, as you know, as we ran through that business in 2010, we had a lot of acquisition content. In fact, we did 17 deals for well over $6 billion. It was really one of our largest years ever on a dollar amount and on a number of deals. So -- and the bulk of those, the majority of those deals, all flowed into software. So software had a lot of work to integrate these businesses into those key plays that we're running. When we do that integration, we're adding resource, we're adding expense for the integration. We're building those teams to grow those deals. So actually, that acquisition integration process was the biggest element in analyzing the margins for the software business. Now I'd reiterate -- I mean, software grew their profitability at 12%, so that was a very strong case to begin with. But as we look at -- going into the second half and we start to yield the growth rates against the software acquisitions, we expect to see margin expansion in the software business on top of the revenue performance. And one point I would also add is the software acquisition based in the second quarter, they did a great job, a great job.

The next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc
Mark, I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more detail on competitive placements in UNIX, and just talk about whether you're actually seeing that rate of competitive placements pick up based on some of the actions of Oracle in the market, or has it been pretty steady here of late?
Mark Loughridge
Well, when you look at it overall, I mean as we've pointed out in the script, it's just quite remarkable, I think, that since beginning of 2009, we're talking about 2,300 customers, $2.3 billion of business that we pulled away from our competition, with 60% of that Oracle and 30% Hewlett-Packard. We've had growth in the UNIX business now for 2 quarters in a row, 8% in the first quarter, 5% in the second quarter, all of that growth was driven by IBM. And if you look underneath it, not only are we gaining very good key pSeries performance, from strong deals with the major markets, but boy, we're getting really strong performance in growth markets. So within the growth markets, we're expanding that platform into new customer sets. So I think the pSeries is going to be an ongoing source of strength. And when you kind of divide it down by the elements, we had more than 20% growth in the high end of pSeries, the entry model pSeries, I mean that more than doubled year-to-year. So it's a pretty strong play. It's going very well in the marketplace. And I think we've done a good job versus competition, but we've also done a good job as we expand that marketplace, especially in growth markets.

The next question comes from Robert Cihra with Caris & Company.
Robert Cihra - Caris & Company
Kind of similar, I guess, to the last question but on mainframe, just obviously, you're having a great up cycle here, but the comps get a lot tougher in the second half. I guess, I'm just curious if your thoughts, if you feel this is simply product cycle, how long the product cycle will go for, or do you think there really is kind of structural mainframe strength that maybe there is some growth to this market beyond cycling, any sort of sense you have on that?
Mark Loughridge
Well, we, as you pointed out, I mean, we had a really powerful quarter in our mainframe. I mean, goodness gracious, when you're up 61%, I mean that's a pretty powerful quarter in the mainframe business. And as you look at those mainframe new customers that we've brought to the platform was zEnterprise, I mean 68 new customers. That's 68 new flags we planted that are going to be a source of business on financing and software, services, all down the road, so it is a very good indication. Now it's not that different from a typical mainframe cycle, the front end of the mainframe cycle defined by new placements and new placement growth as we go into the back half of the cycle. It's more defined by microcode upgrades, less revenue, but more profit margin performance. As we go into the second half of the year, we do start to wrap on that substantial performance that we saw out of the mainframe last year. But for the overall momentum that we see in the STG business across pSeries, which grew 12%; xSeries up 15%; Storage up 10%; Total Services up 20%, we see, again, double-digit profitability from our hardware business in the third quarter. And a difficult comparison going on to fourth quarter, albeit, but a very, very strong year from the unit.
Operator
The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMC.
Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Mark, I want to come back to the software business. I wonder if you can give us a little more color about what's driving this impressive growth. Clearly, IBM is tracking at or above market now for consecutive quarters with respect to software, which is a good thing. So just trying to get a sense, how much of that could be driven by maybe some transitory benefits, either from competitor displacement or as you talked about earlier, the Oracle-Sun displacement versus just a broader trend where you're just winning new customers in general?
Mark Loughridge
As I look at the momentum that we're seeing across the software business, we do have advantages in the marketplace that I believe are playing out. First of all, we don't go to the marketplace with just the software business. It's a very strong, robust software business, but it has this terrific linkage into our GBS consulting business and terrific linkages into the hardware business. So we now can advance those key strategic themes. And those strategic themes are really important to our ongoing business equation. So what we're really focused on is how we're driving software through those key plays of Smarter Planet, business analytics, cloud computing, acceleration in these new opportunity spaces. Underneath the software, again, the way I would look at this, software now has the opportunity to continue to expand of the new placements, the new flags that we have planted on a global basis in our hardware base of business. So it's not as if the minute you close that hardware deal, all your software rolls into the account. That software rolls in over time, and it has opportunity from those new placements. Our real focus is on driving those key strategic plays consistent with our 2015 roadmap.

The last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.
David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Mark, you seem more optimistic about Europe, and if, in fact, that's an accurate read, can you help us better understand the need to take another rebalancing action in Europe after a similar action taken in the first quarter?
Mark Loughridge
Well, let's -- I do feel that we're in a more stable position in Europe. The growth rate in Europe went from 2% to 3%. Within that, we returned to growth in Germany. We returned to growth in Italy. We've got some very strong plays in Europe. Our business, though, is a business of resources and capability, and we're constantly refining that mix of capability through workforce rebalancing. That's simply a part of our business model and the ongoing equation, and that will continue through all businesses and all years, I think. 
So let me take this opportunity now to just make a few comments as we wrap up the call. So this quarter, we continued our strong performance. Revenue growth at 12% was driven by our transaction businesses, with hardware and software, both up 17%. We had fantastic performance across our growth initiatives, Smarter Planet, business analytics and cloud, and, of course, our growth market countries, which were up 13% and grew 10 points faster than the major markets. We delivered 18% growth in operating EPS this quarter and 19% for the first half. 
We're exiting the second quarter with a lot going for us, a strong systems portfolio, continued momentum in software, growth in services backlog with a lot of opportunity in growth markets, momentum in all of our key growth plays and a very strong balance sheet. We've taken our expectations for operating EPS up to at least $13.25. That's up $0.25 since January. 
So as IBM enters its second century, we have our eye on delivering performance over the long term. And the first half of 2011 is a good start towards at least $20 of EPS in 2015. 
So thanks for joining us, and now, as always, it's back to work.

Mark Loughridge
Thanks for joining us today. In the first quarter, we drove 8% revenue growth, expanded gross pretax and net margins and delivered operating earnings per share of $2.41, up 21% year-to-year. With this performance, we're increasing our full year 2011 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $13.15, which is up $0.15 from our previous view of at least $13. This is a great start on the road to our 2015 objective.
Looking at the drivers of our 8% revenue growth, Systems and Technology was up 19% with double-digit growth in every platform led by our System z mainframe and POWER offerings. Our Software revenue was up 10% without the divested PLM operations or 8% at constant currency. Our Total Services revenue was up 6% with Outsourcing up 7%. 
Our Total Services revenue growth rate improved from the fourth quarter. As we’ve discussed the last couple of quarters, the revenue is more influenced by the backlog dynamics than current period transactions, and our total backlog ended the quarter at $142 billion. That's up $8 billion year-to-year or $1.5 billion at constant currency.
From a sector perspective, our 2 largest customer sets, Financial Services and General Business, were each up double digits. Combined, they represent about half our revenue. 
Our key growth plays had fantastic performance. We once again had a very strong quarter in the growth markets, up 12% at constant currency with almost 40 countries up double digits. 
Business Analytics revenue was up 20% with strong contribution from both Software offerings and our Consulting business. Cloud revenue was up by a factor of 5, and Smarter Planet was up about 20%.
Along with IBM's strong revenue growth, we had great margin performance. We expanded operating gross margin by 80 basis points. The improvement was broad based with particularly strong performance in Systems and Technology. With operating expense growing in line with revenue, we improved operating pretax and net margins by 6/10. This quarter, we really demonstrated the leverage in our model. Bottom line, we delivered operating EPS of $2.41, which was up 21% year-to-year. 
Our strong earnings performance generated $800 million of free cash flow in the quarter. And in the last 12 months, we've generated over $15 billion of free cash flow. 
In terms of use of capital, we've had a robust program to return value to shareholders. We returned almost $5 billion in share repurchases and dividends this quarter and almost $19 billion over the last year. 
Now I'll get into the first quarter details, starting with the revenue by geography. With 5% constant currency revenue growth, we had strong performance in major markets and growth markets. I'll focus the geo comments on constant currency. 
Major markets revenue was up 3%. The U.S., our largest market, was up 7%. And Canada was up 9%, leveraging the value of z, POWER and Software offerings. 
For the second consecutive quarter, Europe's performance was led by double-digit growth in France. Our growth markets continued very powerful performance, up 12%, outpacing the majors by 9 points. The combined revenue in the BRICs was up 22% with growth in each of the 4 countries and particularly strong growth in China, which was up 33% and Russia, up 53%. 
We're continuing expansion into new markets. And this quarter, we had double-digit growth in almost 40 growth market countries.
We're leveraging our high-end systems in our Software portfolio and implementing transformational services projects. So this quarter, we had 19% growth in Hardware with great performance in mainframe and POWER and System x, and we had 16% growth in software. 
In Services, we had outsourcing growth of 12%, and our outsourcing signings more than doubled. Recall that last quarter, our signings in the growth markets were up about 250%, so we have continued strong performance in Services. With this performance, we gained share in Hardware, Software and Total Services and in growth markets overall. 
Now while we're discussing our geographic results, I want to spend a minute on Japan. We have 11% of our revenue in Japan with the bulk of our business in Services, which is predominantly annuity based. And so it tends to be more stable through various market conditions. Looking at the dynamics in the quarter, we had some deterioration in March, but it really wasn't that different than we saw through February. So we didn't see a big change in the trajectory of the business. Our employees did a great job working with our clients in a very challenging environment, and I want to congratulate them on their tremendous effort.
Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment. The Total Services revenue growth rate improved to 6% or 3% at constant currency. Global Technology Services led the improvement with higher revenue from backlog and growth from our existing accounts. Systems and Technology again had powerful performance with almost 20% growth. We had strong growth in every platform. All were up double digits at actual rates. 
The most impressive growth was in our high-value systems. System z mainframes were up 41%, and POWER was up almost 20% as we continue to displace competitive systems. Our Software growth was also very strong, up 10% or 8% at constant currency, both excluding the divested PLM operations. Growth was led by Business Analytics, Storage Management and Business Integration, and Netezza is off to a great start. 
Turning to growth profit, our operating gross profit margin improved 80 basis points, led by Systems and Software. The largest contribution came from Systems and Technology, driven by improvements in every systems brand and improving mix. We also expanded gross margin in Software, Global Business Services and Global Financing. 
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and other income was up 8% in line with our revenue growth. The increase was driven by acquisitions over the last 12 months, which contributed 4 points of the increase. This is an assessment of our operating expense and so excludes the impact of amortization. Base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up 4 points driven by a higher level of expense to support this quarter's revenue performance. 
Now I'll comment on a few items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit. First, we had investment gains associated with the asset sales in the quarter, which totaled about $200 million. In our call in January, I mentioned that the investment gains would be relatively offset by a charge for workforce rebalancing actions. This quarter, our workforce rebalancing charges were about $220 million with the majority of the spending in Europe. 
And if you recall, in the first quarter of last year, we had a gain of almost $600 million associated with the sale of our PLM operations to Dassault. And this was effectively offset by a workforce rebalancing charge of $560 million. So we had a very similar dynamic with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalancing charges. 
Now in fact, when you look at the combined impact of the 2 unique items last year and the 2 this year, there is minimal impact on IBM's year-to-year performance in the first quarter though it does impact the segment dynamics. This is because the workforce rebalancing activity in both years was incurred in every segment, but last year's PLM gain was booked in Software. And the investment gains this year were primarily booked above our segment level. 
We provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics by removing last year's PLM gain and workforce rebalancing charges from both years. This gives you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segments. You can see our profit and margin performance is broad based, with strong pretax profit growth in every segment. 
So let's get into the segments. The 2 Services segments delivered $14.6 billion in revenue, up 6% as reported and up 3% at constant currency. Global Technology Services grew 6% as reported, and Global Business Services grew 7% as reported. Both were up 3% at constant currency. 
Looking at a different cut of the revenue, total transaction revenue was $5.9 billion, up 6% or 3% at constant currency. And total Outsourcing revenue was $6.8 billion, up 7% as reported and 4% at constant currency. 
Last quarter, we showed you a chart that described the revenue dynamics of our Outsourcing businesses. We have included that exact chart again as reference. You can find it in our supplemental charts. 
We described how roughly 85% of our annual Outsourcing revenue comes from the backlog at the beginning of the year with the remaining 15% coming predominantly from new sales into our existing client base and a very small fraction coming from new signings. 
We saw those dynamics reflected in the Outsourcing results this quarter. Revenue from backlog was up over 3%. And revenue from sales into our existing base accounts was up as well, driving total constant currency outsourcing growth of 4%. Total backlog was $142 billion, up $8 billion year-to-year and up $1.5 billion excluding currency. 
As we have discussed the past few quarters, backlog is a more stable and comprehensive metric with performance characteristics more similar to revenue, especially for Outsourcing. This quarter, backlog growth was driven by an increase in the opening backlog, lower levels of erosion, growth in our base accounts and currency. 
Now let's move on to the 2 segments. In Global Technology Services revenue was $9.9 billion. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 6% as reported and 3% at constant currency. Revenue growth at constant currency improved by 2 points over last quarter. This was driven primarily by increased revenue from backlog and double-digit growth in add-on business in our Strategic Outsourcing base accounts. 
Growth markets continued to drive strong performance with revenue up 11% year-to-year at constant currency. Integrated Technology Services revenue grew 7% as reported and 4% at constant currency. Here, too, ITS was up 11% at constant currency in the growth markets. 
Global Technology Services pretax income, normalized for the workforce rebalancing charges in both years, was up 10% with 0.5 point of PTI margin expansion. 
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was $4.7 billion. Starting this quarter, we will provide the outsourcing and transactional revenue elements for Global Business Services. We believe this will give you better insight into our revenue dynamics. 
Application Outsourcing revenue, which was just over 20% of GBS revenue, was up 10% as reported and 6% at constant currency. In Consulting and Systems Integration, which includes Consulting, AMS systems integration and the U.S. Federal business, grew 6% as reported and 2% at constant currency.
From a geographic perspective, we had good performance in GBS in North America, which was up 6% at constant currency. From a sector perspective, growth was led by Distribution, General Business and Communications. And we continued to have strong performance in our growth initiatives in GBS, with Business Analytics revenue up over 30%. 
Global Business Services normalized pretax profit was up a very strong 19%, with 1.5 points of margin expansion. This expansion was driven by improved utilization, delivery excellence and improved spending management. 
Software had a strong quarter with revenue of $5.3 billion, which is up 6% or 4% at constant currency. Adjusting for the divestiture of PLM, which is a more appropriate view of our ongoing business, our revenue was up 10% or 8% at constant currency. 
Key Branded Middleware grew 16%, gaining share for the 14th straight quarter and the clear leader of the middleware market. Key Branded Middleware accounted for 61% of our total Software revenue. So we're mixing in to a higher growth element of the business. 
Gartner once again named IBM the worldwide market share leader in the application infrastructure and middleware segment, extending our lead to nearly double that of our nearest competitor. 
Now let me take you through the drivers by brand. WebSphere had another strong quarter, growing about 50% and gaining share. Application Servers and Business Integration, two of the largest product sets in WebSphere, each grew nearly 30%. Sterling Commerce, Unica and Coremetrics were also strong contributors to WebSphere's performance. 
Information Management had another good quarter, up 13%. Business Analytics software was up double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our distributed database had an outstanding quarter, with double-digit growth in our base business complemented by exceptional performance by Netezza. Netezza's transactional volumes were up 50% versus a year ago before we acquired them. We know that when we go head-to-head against competition and customer proof of concepts, we win 80% of the time. So this is a really strong offering. 
Tivoli software grew 8%, and we held share. Tivoli Storage grew 20%, driven by over 60% growth in software for XIV [IBM XIV Storage System]. Rational software grew 5% year-to-year in the first quarter. Rational's Jazz-based products grew 64% year-to-year, the fifth consecutive quarter of year-to-year growth over 50%. 
Software delivered pretax income of $1.7 billion and margin over 28%. PTI is up 9%, normalized for the prior year gain on the sale of PLM to Dassault, as well as charges for workforce rebalancing activities in both years.
Systems and Technology revenue was $4 billion, up 19% year-to-year or 16% at constant currency. This is the best first quarter growth in over a decade. Revenue was driven by double-digit growth in all brands: System z, POWER, System x, Storage, Retail Store Solutions and Microelectronics. 
Growth markets grew 19% at constant currency, and we had double-digit growth in the major markets as well. 
Globally, we gained 2 points of market share in total servers, with strong share gains of 4 points in both mainframe and POWER. Gross profit margin expanded 5 points year-to-year to 38%, and normalized pretax margin was up 7.5 points. 
Now let me take you through the brands. System z revenue grew 41% year-to-year. MIPS grew 34% year-to-year. That's the highest first quarter MIPS growth since 2004. Power Systems grew 19% year-to-year. Entry systems more than doubled year-to-year. And high end grew over 30%, reflecting the strong market acceptance of our POWER7 product line. 
We extended our market leadership this quarter, the 12th consecutive quarter of year-to-year share gain. IBM's strong performance accounted for almost all of the UNIX industry's 8% growth.
In the first quarter, we had 210 competitive displacements, which results in over $200 million of business. Roughly 60% of these wins came from Oracle's legacy Sun installed accounts and 30% from HP installed accounts. Since first quarter 2009, IBM drove nearly 2,000 competitive displacements for about $2 billion of business. 
In February, IBM demonstrated how an optimized, commercially available mid-range Power 750 system we call Watson could interpret natural language and answer complex questions in real time. We did not invest in this just to play the game of Jeopardy. We invested to provide business applications leadership to our clients. 
Storage Hardware revenue grew 10% year-to-year driven by Disk, which was up 13%. In the growth market, Storage revenue grew 14% at constant currency. System x revenue grew 13% and held share. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. High-end systems x grew 42% and gained share. Retail Store Solutions grew 18% and extended IBM's leadership position as a point-of-sale provider. Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 23% year-to-year.
Overall, Systems and Technology had a great start to 2011 with a strong performance, with revenue up 19%, gross profit margins up 5 points and normalized pretax income up nearly $300 million, with margin of 7.5 points.
Turning to cash flow. We generated $800 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which is down $600 million year-to-year. The year-to-year decline is driven entirely by an $800 million increase due to income tax settlement payments. Excluding the impact of tax payments, free cash flow would have been up about $150 million year-to-year. 
In addition, we continue to invest in our business to drive future growth. Net capital expenditures were up $150 million year-to-year and supported new services contracts and investments in semiconductor tools. Our inventory continues to be well managed, and collections were strong. 
Looking at the uses of our cash, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders, $800 million in dividends and $4 billion in share repurchase, where we bought back 25.5 million shares. At the end of the first quarter, we had $4.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $13.2 billion, up $1.6 billion from year end. Total debt was $30.3 billion, of which nearly $24 billion was in support of our Financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. 
Our non-financing debt was $6.5 billion, and our non-financing debt-to-cap was 25%, up from 23% at the end of the year. With this amount of leverage, we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility. Our balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term.
So let me start to wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. This quarter, 8% revenue growth made a strong contribution to our earnings growth, $0.15 year-to-year. Margin expansion, in this case driven by gross margin, added $0.11, and lower share count contributed $0.15. So we had fairly balanced contribution from each. 
Now let me put our first quarter performance in the context of the drivers of our 2015 roadmap. Our revenue was up 8%, led by our transaction businesses and Outsourcing. Our growth plays are providing good lift. Revenue in the growth markets was up 12% at constant currency and represented almost half of our geographic revenue growth. We had strong growth in System z, POWER, System x, Software and Outsourcing. 
Our Business Analytics revenue was up 20%, with 15% in Software and over 30% in GBS. We're continuing to build our capabilities, and Watson is a great example of our continued innovation in analytics. 
With revenue from cloud offerings up by a factor of 5, we're on track to double our cloud revenue in 2011. Last week, we announced both new private cloud software and the IBM SmartCloud designed to run production applications. We believe this differentiated offering will be a leader in the enterprise cloud segment.
In Smarter Planet, which grew about 20% this quarter, we’re applying IT outside our traditional market areas. We're combining our deep industry expertise with software and services capabilities to deliver solutions that range from improving automated manufacturing productivity to optimizing core retail processes to intelligent transportation. So we have good momentum on our growth plays and are continuing to invest in the innovation to drive future growth.
The second major contributor to our roadmap is margin expansion. This quarter, we drove significant margin improvement with operating pretax and net margins each up 60 basis points. This profit performance allows us not only to invest for the future but to return significant value to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned almost $5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends. 
With this start to the year, we're increasing our full year 2011 expectation for operating earnings per share to at least $13.15 on our way to operating EPS of at least $20 in 2015.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.
Yes, thank you. Mark, I wanted to talk about Services signings, which you uncharacteristically did not discuss in your prepared remarks but are in the exhibit in the supplemental slides. The signings were down 18% year-over-year at constant currency. And I think that was a surprise given you had very strong signings last quarter, and you talked about signings momentum at your analyst day and on your last earnings call. Now I realize that one quarter signings doesn't make a trend, but it looks like your last 4 quarters’ trailing signings are actually down. Your total backlog is up 1% year-over-year. So I guess the questions coming out of that are: can you make some comments around signings, why your short-term signings were down 5%, extensions were up 12%? And is it really realistic to think you're going to have accelerating Services revenue growth as you had previously talked about given your backlog is only up 1% year-over-year at constant currency?
Mark Loughridge
Okay. That's a great question, Toni. Let's start with performance. I mean, in the first quarter, you did see, in fact, that we did have an acceleration of performance in our Services business. I mean, overall, revenue for our Services business was up 1% in total. Our Outsourcing business was up 2%. We had 1% increase in our transaction business. In fact, Outsourcing, the actual rates was up 7%. So we did see the acceleration that we had discussed. Now let's break this into its components. Let's start with Outsourcing. Now first of all, let's acknowledge the fact that Outsourcing in the fourth quarter was up a very strong 25%. In fact, in total, we signed in the fourth quarter $22 billion. So on the Outsourcing business, I think it's quite logical to anticipate that we'd be rebuilding the pipeline in the first quarter. And in fact, that base of business in the fourth quarter with the growth rate that we have, that's our seasonally largest quarter and a very strong performance. So that's driving a lot of what you see in our Outsourcing revenue performance. We characterized this in the last call by saying it was more logical on this base of business to look at backlog. And in that call, we showed the backlog runout, which we've included in the supplementals. Now in the backlog runout, we said that base backlog runout would drive 85% of our Outsourcing revenue performance for the year. And in fact, we said that, that rollout was up 3% in the backlog. In fact, that came right through as we had discussed. The balance of 15% in the Outsourcing business is really driven by base growth. And this signings content in the year on the Outsourcing content really has very little to yield within the -- in that calendar year. That's why backlog is fundamentally a more important metric. That yield from our base account, you look at that growth in our Strategic Outsourcing business, it was up 19% in the fourth quarter for the first time in a long time. And again, in the first quarter, we had very strong growth in our base business at 11% for Strategic Outsourcing. So if you look at that content and the stability of that overall backlog, again, first quarter was $142 billion, and at actual rates, that's up $8 billion year-to-year. We've got a strong base of business going into the year. There will be volatility, especially in that Outsourcing component in signings. But the better metric, I think, and the way we characterize our comments and I think it came through in the quarter to demonstrate that that's fundamentally a better metric, is backlog did yield on revenue growth. And if you look at that overall Outsourcing business, I think we did pretty well. When you look at the transactional business, transactional business in the quarter was impacted by public sector. Now public sector, I think you had all realized, is driven by the events that we're all reading in the newspaper. So let's just airlift public sector out of the transactional revenue and signings. And there you'd see that our transactional business, in fact, was up about healthy mid-single digits in both revenue and signings performance, not inconsistent with the kind of actual rate performance that we saw in the fourth quarter. Going into the balance of the year, we expect to have good yield against the pipeline that we see and the ongoing stability in our backlog driving the Outsourcing business. Funny thing -- fundamentally, when you step back again and say, ""What's our objective,"" our objective is to move to higher value offerings in higher value solutions across the business unit. And I think you saw that in our Services business, with profitability in Services up 13% in total and GBS, a very strong 19%, while our GTS business was up 10%.

The next question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG
Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on that last question with respect to the pipeline you see in the competitive environment. We've seen some mixed execution by some competitors. Have you seen any changes to the pricing environment and the competitive environment? That's #1. And then #2 is around the pipeline. You mentioned you expected yield on the pipeline you see. Can you give us a little more color there? Thanks a lot.
Mark Loughridge
Yes. When we look at the pipeline going forward in our Services business, we see good year-to-year performance in the pipeline. And then when you look at kind of other in the -- from an industry dimension behind that, let's look at growth markets. I mean the GMU content -- remember, for Outsourcing signings was up 250% in the fourth quarter. That's an enormous year-to-year growth rate as we see these big opportunities open up in the growth markets element of our business. This quarter, signings once again were up more than 100%, so doubling year-to-year. So we do see the Outsourcing business, especially the Strategic Outsourcing content, opening up in a big way in growth markets. And we're looking at that trend not unlike the trend that we see in other parts of our business. So growth market, a very solid base growing quite substantially in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter as we see more and more business migrate to that growth market envelope. The second thing that I would comment on, the real business and the real job of our Services business is to drive performance in those key growth investments that we have covered for the last 2 analyst meetings. So how did we do on the base of business? Well, if you look at Smarter Planet, Smarter Planet was up 20%. Let's look at Business Analytics. Business Analytics as well was up 20%. Within GBS, GBS supporting Business Analytics was up 32%. So you could see that momentum in those key areas. If you look at our GTS business driving the cloud investment, we saw cloud up 5x, and we feel pretty confident that that's on track to double this year. And if we double this year, that's the kind of trend line we need to generate $7 billion in cloud by 2015, of which 3 will be incremental. And lastly, I can't say enough about GMU. Here we are, GMU in the growth markets content outpacing major markets again by 9 points; coming off of 2008 with an 8-point premium; 2009, again, 8-points faster; 2010, 10 points faster; and another confirmation in that data point in the first quarter.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Chris.

The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Thanks. Mark, I want to get your thoughts on acquisitions this year. Some of the next generation technology companies seem to be hitting tougher growth comps and could stand to benefit from broader distribution from the likes of IBM. How do you think about leveraging your balance sheet to help take these companies to the next level versus sitting back and allowing some of your other large technology peers pick up these assets?
Mark Loughridge
Well, that's a very good question, Katy. We're quite focused on driving that acquisition element of our overall game plan. As we went through analyst day, we had pointed out that we expected within the 2015 roadmap to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions. Now that will not be a straight line. It's not going to be a kind of linear relationship. Those acquisitions are key business investments for us. And the #1 metric we're looking for is when we do the acquisition, we want our cash back. It's very simple. The Chairman's emphasized that, and we make sure that's our primary metric. As far as our ability to drive that acquisition envelope, we did very, very well this quarter on our acquisition base. And you remember that we did $6.5 billion last year. That was 17 acquisitions. So for me, looking at it, that was a very good proof point on our ability to integrate a number of acquisitions simultaneously. And very few businesses, I think, could integrate that many acquisitions. You have to have a very large well-trained team to be able to do that, and they accomplish it with real commitment. So we did a large base of business in the 2010 calendar year: $6.5 billion, 17 acquisitions. As we said in the analyst day, that relatively put us ahead of pace going into the 5-year period for 2015. In fact, just analytically, we would only need about 1/2 of that $20 billion to hit the financial objective we had from acquisitions. So I believe that as we go through this and go through the 2015 roadmap, I would anticipate that we'd stay on that $20 billion objective. And with that, we should be able to overachieve our financial objectives from acquisitions.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy.

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital
Yes, thanks a lot. Mark, wanted to ask about Japan. You've said it's 11% of sales and mostly Services. So I guess: a, what is the impact in the upcoming quarters? I would assume that revenues there would be pressured more in upcoming quarters, but you didn't mention that. And then in particular, you grew over 6% combined in both your Services segment. And if Japan is mostly Services, even more so than other geos, then wouldn't that lend credibility to 6%-plus this quarter being the high watermark for Services growth for the year? Or am I looking at that completely wrong? Thanks a lot.
Mark Loughridge
Well, thanks, Ben. That's a good question. First of all, when you talk about Japan, I want to take it in steps. Now #1, all of our employees are safe, and that's certainly our #1 priority. Number 2, our infrastructure content within the geography is also in very good shape. I mean, if you look at the impact that we had on infrastructure, the damage was about $20 million, which is a very low level of impact. Number 3, if you look at the supply chain, our supply chain is in very good shape. Frankly, most parts today are dual sourced, so you're not dependent on just one line. But we were not impacted in the quarter based on supply chain impact, and I don't expect that will have any appreciable impact going forward. So then you do come back to the point looking at the Services profile. About 3/4 of the business in Japan is Services. Services -- as we've seen over the past 3 years, when we took the entire corporation through the recession, Services tend to be more stable in those kind of turbulent times. And I think we expect to see that in Japan as well. In the profile in Japan, as you go from the trajectory they were on for January and February into March, March eroded about 1%. So we did see some erosion, but it wasn't a lot of erosion. And that 1% erosion on the kind of magnitude of corporation I think is easily absorbed by the business. I'd also point out one other thing. When you look at Japan's performance in the quarter, they were also negatively impacted by about 2 points based on the PLM compare. There was a lot of PLM business in the country of Japan. Going forward, they won't have that issue in their compares. So relatively, they'll have about a 2-point tailwind compared to the first quarter on their business. So as I look at it, I don't see anything in the performance in Japan that we should have difficulty dealing with as we go through the year, but we're going to have to keep a close eye on it and see how it plays out. Now I do want to close out with our comments on Japan and commend our employees in Japan for their courageous performance in these difficult times and the terrific performance they did supporting our customers.
Patricia Murphy

The next question comes from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Scott Craig
Thanks. Mark, with the great numbers coming out of z [zSeries] and pSeries, typically, you get some pretty good product cycles, better than expected growth as the product cycles continue. So how much longer do you think we've got some good outsize growth in that business given your performance here recently? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
Okay. Well, let's take those in turn. First of all, both zSeries and pSeries picked up 4 points a share. And for the pSeries business, that's our 12th consecutive share gain that we had in that business. As well I'll point out that we had 19% growth in our pSeries this quarter, and as we estimated, the UNIX business had about 8%. So given that we have over 40% share in that business, if you just do the math, you could kind of conclude that we had -- we drove in IBM the majority of the revenue growth in the UNIX business. So for us, I see real opportunity to continue this rate of performance on our pSeries base of business. And if you look at pSeries, it's not only a really strong platform in the major markets, it's very strong in the growth markets. When you look at those growth market placements, they've done very, very well as we expand that base of business. zSeries, likewise, did well in growth markets and major markets this quarter and should have ongoing growth potential, especially in the growth market. Now to your point on our product cycle, I think on the zSeries product cycle, this year will be a strong year for us. It will be driven more by box placement and customer acceptances. Next year will be driven more by upgrades. As we get to the fourth quarter, I do expect that the zSeries will now wrap on a very strong quarter last year. But I'd point out that STG had a terrific quarter across every one of their product lines. And I really think it's only zSeries that I would expect to ramp as we go into the fourth quarter. The balance of the businesses, I think, have very healthy prospects throughout the year.
Scott Craig
Okay, thank you.

The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMC.
Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co
Yes, thank you. Mark, quick question here on the Software as we try to kind of contextualize some of these puts and takes to Japan and what it could mean from a Services perspective if there is any sort of impact down the road. Your Software business, really here globally, is tracking to the broader software market for the first time in a while now in the last 2 quarters. I just want to get a sense if you can kind of convey confidence in terms of can that be sustained. And how should we think about the displacements in terms of your new customer accounts versus legacy in terms of what you're selling into with Software?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. When you look at that business against my comments, excluding PLM, we had a 10% growth in the quarter. The Key Branded Middleware was up 16%. Good profit growth on that base, up 9%. So I think once again, we had a very strong quarter from our software base of business, especially if you go down the brands within that. I mean, WebSphere up 51%; Information Management, up 13%; Tivoli, up 8%; Rational, up 5%. I mean, good strong performance across that content. But as you look at the second quarter and look at the pipeline in the second quarter, we've got a very robust pipeline growing double digits year-to-year in the second quarter across our business and even stronger in our large deal base and large account content to drive that transactional performance. So I feel like we had a strong quarter in the first for our Software business. And based on the pipeline we see for the transactional elements of our Software business, we should have another good quarter in the second.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark.

The next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc
Thank you very much. Mark, I have to, I guess, echo my competitor's comments that the biggest surprise for me was the lack of transactional signings growth in the quarter given where we are in the cycle. And so I was hoping that you might be able to differentiate a little bit between what you're seeing within transactional signings in pipeline, between the ITS, Consulting and AMS businesses. I guess I'll stop there. Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
Well, when you look at the components, first of all, I want to take transactional performance as a whole. We did have difficulty in public sector. But if you snap public sector out of the transactional performance, then we had mid-single digit growth in our transactional signings and mid-single digit growth in our transactional revenue. Now underneath that, I think ITS did much better as it went into the first quarter. You saw that they had a revenue growth of 4%. Behind that, they had good signing performance, so I expect them to be in an improving trajectory as we go through the year. Excluding the impact of public sector, I think overall, transactional business did well. But I think also, bottom line, when you look at the key elements of our growth plays, we did well in Smarter Planet. We did very well in Business Analytics. And bottom line, as we move into those higher value spaces, those were an element of growing our profitability in GBS by 19% and GTS by 10%. And that is the bottom line objective.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Rich.
Operator
The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Yes, thanks. Mark, I actually wanted to ask about Services profitability as you track through the year. And the question is: you had a increase in each of GTS and GBS in terms of profit margins or PTI margins. Would you anticipate that trend to continue through the year? And if you could address also some of your competitors, especially the non-domestic ones, have talked about wage inflation, turnover and even for IBM, addressing mix impact and how that might increase or impact profit margins for Service division as we march through the year.
Mark Loughridge
Well, when you look at the overall performance on both PTI and net income for IBM as a whole, we are up 0.6 point on both. Now on net income, as we've gone through at the analyst meeting, the model for net income is about 0.3 point. So clearly, we had a very strong performance in the quarter, about double the yield that we think we need over the longer term in the base business. A solid player in that contribution was, in fact, as you point out, Services. That in total was up 0.9 point on PTI margin, with GTS up about 0.5 point and GBS 1.5 points. Now if you look at that incremental advantage, that was driven by strong operational performance in the business unit and the attention we're putting on moving to higher value contracts, higher value spaces, globalizing our infrastructure for better productivity. And I think we saw yield in the quarter, and we're going to continue to drive that metric for the year.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Keith.

The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.
David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you. Mark, I appreciate your incremental disclosures on the services and the commentary about the backlog. That said, could you help us understand what kind of growth you need in the backlog to hit your revenue growth targets for both the Outsourcing business and the transactional business?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Let's go back, and let's talk about the Outsourcing business to begin with. Again, I would refer you to the bar chart that we put in the supplementals. If you look at that bar chart, you'll say well, what are the big drivers of the revenue within the year as we move through 2011? The biggest driver is the backlog that we entered the year with, and that's going to drive about 85% of the revenue performance in the year. As we did the rollout of that backlog, we said, well, the rollout itself is up about 3%. The balance of 15% is going to be driven, again, not by signings, which can be quite volatile across period, but it's to be driven by base growth performance. And that base growth performance, especially in our SO content, was up 19% in the fourth quarter. It's up 11% in the first quarter. And if we get those 2, we should be able to sustain a pretty good outsourcing growth in revenue throughout the year. Again, on the transactional side, I would say that once again, acknowledge that we were having difficulty in public sector. But outside of public sector, we had mid-single digit performance at both signings and revenue and again, at the bottom line in GBS, 19% profit growth.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David.
Operator
The last question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Okay, great, and thanks, Mark. Looking at the weakness in the public sector you just mentioned, should we expect this weakness to start to have some impact on Services revenues or other segment revenues as expressed throughout the year? I'm just trying to get an understanding of the risk we have to the models in that specific vertical given that I would suspect the weakness in transactional signings at least has some indication of what we should see there in coming quarters.
Mark Loughridge
Well, let's put that in the -- first of all, we dealt with the weakness in the public sector content in signings this quarter, and you saw the yield against revenue this quarter. So I think we – though it’s -- the public sector impact on the signings revenue base can be a large part of the GBS business, it isn't going to be the difference maker in the overall IBM base of business. When you look at it and step back further and just look at the sectors across the business, I mean, we did have 1% growth in revenue at actual rates for public sector, and that is about 15% of our business. But on the other hand, Financial Services sector was up 14%. General Business was up 10%. And those are by far the largest sector performances that we have. So I feel as if looking at this, we are prepared to be able to deal with over a longer term kind of a basis. It can be a big deal to GBS. I think it is easily managed by the overall IBM Corporation and the strength that we see in other sectors. 
So let me just make a few comments to wrap up the call. This quarter, we delivered very strong revenue and profit. Our revenue growth of 8% was driven by our transactional business and Outsourcing, which was up 7%. We had fantastic performance across our growth initiatives: Smarter Planet, up 20%; Business Analytics, up 20%; cloud, up by a factor of 5; and our growth market countries up 12%, 9 points faster than the major markets, continuing the trend we saw in 2008, 2009 and 2010. We expanded margins 60 basis points each in operating PTI and net income and delivered 21% growth in operating EPS. That's the best growth in more than 2 years, and it's on the back of 16% growth last year.
So we're exiting the first quarter with a lot going for us: a strong Systems portfolio, a good pipeline in Software, solid Services backlog, momentum in all our key growth plays and ongoing productivity initiatives, as well as a very strong balance sheet. And I think all of this supports an increase of $0.15 to our expectation for the year and puts us on a good track for the trend line to $20 in 2015 with an outlook for the year of at least $13.15. 
So thanks for joining us. And now, as always, it's back to work.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/264358-international-business-machines-management-discusses-q1-2011-results-earnings-call-transcript

Mark Loughridge
Thanks for joining us today. We just completed a great quarter, with 7% revenue growth, both as reported and at constant currency, expansion of gross pre-tax and net margins and earnings per share of $4.18, up 16% year-to-year. This represents our 32nd consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth, the only Dow component with that record. And we generated $8.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up $1.5 billion year-to-year. 
Our revenue growth of 7% was the best constant-currency revenue growth in almost a decade, driven by Hardware and Software. Systems and Technology was up 22% at constant currency, with growth in every platform and particularly strong performance in our System z mainframe. Our Softer revenue was up 12% at constant currency without the divested PLM operations. And as I said back in October, our total services revenue growth rate was in line with the third quarter. 
Our total services backlog ended the year at $142 billion. At constant currency, that's up $4 billion year-to-year and up $7 billion since September.
From a geographic perspective, our major market revenue growth was 5% at constant currency, led by the U.S., France and Italy. Our growth markets revenue was up 13% at constant currency. Business Analytics, one of our key growth initiatives, was up 19%. 
Along with strong revenue growth, we had great profit and margin performance while continuing a high level of investment. You see this in our financial summary. We expanded gross margin by 8/10, with increases in Systems and Technology and Software. 
Our expense was up 7% year-to-year, in line with the revenue growth. The increase was driven by acquisitions over the last 12 months and higher expenses associated with our strong revenue performance, as well as investments in capacity for ongoing growth.
We increased pre-tax income by 9%, and pre-tax margin was up over 50 basis points to 24%. Our net income was also up 9%, and net margin expanded to over 18%. Finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a 6% reduction in our share count. 
When you put this all together, we delivered EPS of $4.18, which is up 16% year-to-year. For the full year, our EPS was $11.52, up 15%, making this our eighth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth.
Our strong earnings performance drove $16 billion of free cash flow, up $1.2 billion year-to-year. And consequently, we're ending the year with a very strong balance sheet, including $11.7 billion of cash, most of which is in the U.S. 
I want to put this performance in the context of our 2010 roadmap. I'll then take you through the details of our fourth quarter results and wrap up with our 2015 roadmap.
Early in 2007, we established our earnings per share roadmap to 2010. This is a chart I showed at our Investor Meeting in May of the 2007, when we introduced the roadmap. In that meeting, we presented an EPS objective of $10 to $11. 
In addition to the EPS target, we provided an analysis of the key factors driving earnings growth from 2006 to 2010. Now at the end of the roadmap period, we've delivered $11.52 of earnings per share, well above the high end of the range of $10 to $11. 
Let me go through the major elements. With the pressure on revenue given the recession, we relied on other elements of our model to achieve the 2010 objective. We worked on our cost and expense structure, continuing to globalize our business. We continued to improve our mix of business, and we generated a lot of cash, which allowed us to acquire key capabilities and to return significant value to shareholders.
So we delivered the results with margin expansion, acquisitions and share repurchase. And we said at the time that the improvements in pension would be what it would be due to the variability of market returns and discount rates. So we were able not only to achieve but to exceed the roadmap objective due to the resilience of our business model. 
Looking at our progress by year, we've had consistently strong performance in EPS, with double-digit growth every year. With 2010 EPS of $11.52, we beat the low end of the target by $1.52 and the high end by $0.52, which is even more impressive when you consider we had to deal with the severe recession.
In fact, IBM performed better than others over the last few years, and this resulted in superior returns to investors over the roadmap period. IBM's business results since 2006 significantly outperformed those of the S&P 500. If you compare our EPS growth to the S&P, you can see that IBM's growth rate is 17%,  while the earnings of the S&P was flat. And when you look at total return on the stock, which includes share price plus dividends, we cumulatively returned 62% or $47 billion of shareholder value since the end of 2006, while an investment in the S&P resulted in a modest decline.
IBM's performance is the result of a transformation we started at the beginning of this decade. We've been shifting our business to higher value areas, improving productivity and investing to drive future growth. 
The changes to our business are pretty dramatic. I'll give you a couple of examples. To capture the opportunity in emerging markets, we created a dedicated management system and have been investing to drive market expansion and infrastructure development. Since 2000, we've added $10 billion in annual revenue from our growth markets. And with these markets consistently outpacing the more established major markets, the revenue contribution from the growth markets has increased significantly to 21% in 2010.
Across all of IBM, we have been shifting to higher value areas while divesting commoditizing businesses. These actions have contributed to a significant change in our mix of business. 
In 2000, Services segment's PTI was $4.5 billion, and in 2010, it's over $8 billion. Our Software profit growth is even more impressive. In 2000, Software segment PTI was $2.8 billion, and in 2010, it's over $9 billion. That's more than tripled, and Software now contributes 44% of our segment profit, up from 25% in 2000. 
When you look at IBM's financial results since 2000, we've added $10 billion of pre-tax income, nearly tripled EPS and generated $109 billion of free cash flow over the period. Our strong profit and cash generation has allowed us to invest in the business while delivering significant shareholder returns. 
Over the last 10 years, we've invested almost $60 billion in R&D, as well as $32 billion of gross spend to acquire 116 companies, adding to our capabilities and high-value areas like Business Analytics and Smarter Planet. At the same time, we've returned $107 billion to shareholders, almost $90 billion through share repurchases, and we've increased our dividends fivefold since 2000.
2010 marks the end of a very successful decade. The changes we've made over the last 10 years have strengthened our business and positioned us well to deliver over the next five years. Now let me get into the fourth quarter details, starting with the revenue by geography.
With 7% revenue growth, we had strong performance in major markets and growth markets. I'll focus the geo comments on constant currency. 
Major markets revenue was up 5%, driven by the U.S. and Southwest Europe. The U.S., our largest market, was up 10%. This is the strongest year-to-year growth in 11 years, with improvements across our businesses. Europe's performance was led by double-digit growth in France and solid performance in Italy.
As I mentioned in the opening, our growth markets had terrific performance, up 13%. For the full year, the growth markets were up 11% and outpaced the major markets by 10 points, faster than we saw in both 2008 and 2009. The combined revenue in the BRICs was up 17%, with growth in each of the four countries, in particular, the strong growth in China, which was up 25% and Russia, up 46%. 
Our growth markets performance was broad based, with double-digit growth in 50 growth market countries, up from 32 last quarter. We picked up share in Hardware and Software and gained share in growth markets overall. 
Turning to revenue by segment. As expected, the total Services growth rate was consistent with the third quarter. So the improvement in our revenue growth was driven by the Hardware and Software transactional businesses. Systems and Technology had fantastic performance, with 21% growth. We had growth in every platform, but the most impressive growth was in our System z mainframes, which were up almost 70%. 
Our Software growth was also very strong, up 11%, excluding the divested PLM operations, a view that best represents our ongoing business. Software growth continues to be led by key areas like Business Commerce, Systems Management and Business Analytics. I'll get into more detail when we discuss the segments.
Our total expense and other income was up 7%, in line with our revenue growth. Growth in acquisitions expense contributed four points of the increase. Base expense, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up five points, driven by a higher level of expense to drive this quarter's strong revenue performance and investment in capacity to support future growth. 
Now I'll comment on a couple of items that had larger year-to-year impacts to our profit.
Our workforce or balancing charges were better by about $60 million year-to-year. In the first quarter of 2011, we expect a gain on asset sale, which will be largely offset by workforce rebalancing predominantly in Europe, but we expect restructuring charges to be down year-to-year. And second, with the year-to-year change in currencies, our hedge of cash flow program generated a loss of about $40 million in the quarter in costs and expense as compared to last year's loss of over $250 million.
We estimate that the total help to the bottom line from currency between translation and hedging is about $0.06 year-to-year in the quarter, but a year-to-year hurt to the full year EPS of about $0.11. 
So now let's turn to our segments.
The two Services segments delivered $14.9 billion in revenue, up 2%. Global Business Services grew 4%, and Global Technology Services was up 1%. Total backlog was $142 billion. At constant currency, this is up $4 billion year-to-year and $7 billion quarter-to-quarter. Backlog for outsourcing businesses, which is the primary driver of Outsourcing revenue, was $97 billion, up $1 billion year-to-year and $5 billion quarter-to-quarter, excluding currency. Total signings were $22.1 billion, up 18%, with transactional signings of $8 billion, up 8% and outsourcing signings of $14 billion, up 24%. This quarter, we signed 19 deals over $100 million.
Now let's move on to the two segments. 
In Global Technology Services, revenue was $10.2 billion. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 1%. Revenue was driven primarily from existing backlog. Though this quarter, we had an increase in revenue from our base accounts, which was the first quarter of base growth since the fourth quarter of 2008. We see customers starting to spend more in their base business as we exit the recession. The increase in Outsourcing backlog was due to the significant demand for our offerings in the growth markets as we help our clients build out their IT infrastructures. 
Integrated Technology Services revenue growth improved from previous quarters as we continue to have good performance in the growth markets. Global Technology Services pre-tax income was up 6%, and pre-tax margin expanded to 15.8%. 
Turning to Global Business Services. Revenue was up 4% to $4.8 billion. We delivered growth in outsourcing and in our transactional businesses, both Consulting and systems integration. We gained share for total GBS, with gains in Consulting and sustained share in Application Management Services. 
From a geographic perspective, our best performance was in North America, which was up 11% at constant currency. From a sector perspective, growth was led by distribution, Financial Services, industrial and General Business. And we continued to have good performance on our growth initiatives in GBS, with Business Analytics revenue up over 40%. We've now added over 4,000 consultants in 2010 and now have over 7,800 dedicated consultants on our Business Analytics practice.
Global Business Services pre-tax profit margin was 15% as we continued to invest in globally integrated capabilities and skills to support growth initiatives. 
Before moving from Services, let me spend a minute on the drivers of revenue in our Services business. First, I'll focus the discussion on the outsourcing businesses, which are just under half of Services revenue and includes Strategic Outsourcing, Business Transformation Outsourcing and Application Outsourcing. Then I'll move on to the transactional businesses. 
We had a great quarter in Outsourcing signings, up 24%. On a dollar basis, that's double our third quarter signings. So very strong performance, but also a good example of signings volatility or unevenness by quarter. We've included a chart that shows Outsourcing revenue and signings growth for the last three years. As you can see, Outsourcing signings are very volatile and certainly not a good predictor of revenue. This is due to the many factors that impact how signings ultimately translate to revenue, such as duration, start date, new versus extensions. 
On the bottom of the chart, you can see Outsourcing backlog over the same period. This backlog has been very stable, with characteristics more similar to revenue. It's primarily in the composition of contracts within the backlog that drive revenue growth. 
To better understand that composition and the impact on revenue over the next year, we've taken a look at how that backlog runs out over time. The biggest driver of next year's Outsourcing revenue is, in fact, the backlog that we entered the year with. 
In the next chart, you see that a high percentage of 2010 Outsourcing revenue came from the backlog that we started the year with. Most of the remaining revenue came from new business we sold into our existing accounts and a much smaller portion from new client signings. 
Although these factors can change year-to-year, the general characteristics are consistent over time. Now if you look at our Outsourcing backlog at the end of 2010, the revenue that we expect to come from backlog in 2011 is, in fact, up 3% year-to-year. So we have very good visibility into a large component of next year's performance.
Now we turn to the transactional businesses, which are just over 1/3 of services revenue and include Integrated Technology Services and Consulting and systems integration. As you can see in the chart, when you look at the combined transactional businesses, the revenue growth and signings growth are very similar within a quarter. To help investors better understand the Services revenue drivers, our plan is to import the outsourcing backlog as a discrete metric each quarter and then next year, update the Outsourcing backlog runout. And we will begin reporting the transactional and outsourcing revenue components of Global Business Services, which gives you better insight into revenue.
Software had a very strong quarter. Revenue of $7 billion was up 7% or 8% at constant currency. Adjusting for the divestiture of PLM, which is a more appropriate view of our ongoing business, our revenue is up 11% or 12% at constant currency. This is double the growth rate of our strong performance in the first three quarters of the year. 
Key Branded Middleware grew 13%, gaining share for the 13th straight quarter, as we continue to extend our lead in the middleware market. Software revenue continues to mix to the faster-growing Branded Middleware. In the quarter, it accounted for 66% of our total Software, up three points from this time last year. 
We had very strong performance in our Key Middleware brands: WebSphere up 32% year-to-year; Tivoli was up 12%; Rational up 10%; and the Information Management up 10%. And we continue to add to IBM's capabilities. With the acquisition of Netezza, we can extend the value of Business Analytics to both large enterprises and smaller clients with a system that's simple, economical and offers quick time to value.
Netezza is a leading provider of high-performance analytics appliances that can be up and running in a matter of hours, handling complex analytical queries 10 to 100 times faster than traditional systems. It helps clients gain faster insights into their business information with increased performance at a lower cost. Netezza got off to a strong start this quarter and complements IBM's Business Analytics and optimization capabilities.
The fourth quarter wrapped up a strong year for our Software segment, with $3.2 billion of profit in the quarter, up 4%. We delivered $9.1 billion of Software profit for the year, up $1 billion year-to-year. Our Software profit has tripled since 2000 and in 2010, contributed 44% of IBM segment profit. 
Our Systems and Technology segment had a terrific quarter, delivering $6.3 billion of revenue, up 21% year-to-year or 22% at constant currency. This is the best revenue performance in over a decade. Revenue was driven by growth in all brands, with strong double-digit growth in System z, Power Entry Systems, System x, Disk Storage, Retail Store Solutions and Microelectronics.
Both the major markets and growth markets grew over 20% year-to-year. We gained three points in market share in total servers and gained share in each of the server brands, while storage held share. Gross profit margin expanded one point, and PTI margin expanded three points, while pre-tax income grew 45% year-to-year. For the full year, revenue was $18 billion, up 11% year-to-year, maintaining our market share leadership in systems. 
Now let me take a few more details by brand.
System z revenue grew 69% year-to-year, driven by our first full quarter of shipments of the new z enterprise. This performance reflects the value and innovation System z delivers to our customers. MIPS grew 58% year-to-year, the highest growth in six years, and we added new 24 new System z customers to the platform. Power Systems grew 2% year-to-year and 6% when you combine POWER hardware with our Power Systems software. 
We extended our market leadership this quarter, the 11th consecutive quarter of year-to-year share gains. This was the first quarter with the complete POWER7 product line available. We had strong customer acceptance of the newly introduced entry systems, which grew 30% year-to-year. And we sold out of our 520, 720 and 740 entry systems. Mid-range POWER grew 7% year-to-year, the third consecutive quarter of growth. And in the fourth quarter, we shipped nearly 200 high-end 795 servers, three times as many as the third quarter, with strong momentum as we enter 2011.
Our competitive takeouts continued in the fourth quarter. We drove over 280 competitive unit displacements, which resulted in approximately $325 million of business. This is the largest quarter ever for POWER competitive displacements. 
For the year, we had over 1,000 competitive displacements, which generated sales of nearly $1 billion. Roughly 60% of these wins came from legacy Sun units installed accounts and 30% from HP installed accounts. We also drove X86 consolidations to POWER, with over 100 competitive wins. 
Storage Hardware revenue grew 8% year-to-year or 10% at constant currency. In the growth markets, storage revenue grew 23% year-to-year at constant currency. This is the third consecutive quarter of growth above 20%. This grew 11%, driven by continued strength in high-end storage, DS8000 and XIV. We added more than 200 new customers to our XIV platform in the fourth quarter and over 975 since the acquisition, and we had a successful launch of our new V7000 mid-range product, which was sold out.
System x revenue grew 18% year-to-year, the fifth consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. Growth was driven by the high end of System x, which was up over 30%. System x Blades grew 14% year-to-year. 
Retail Store Solutions grew 26% year-to-year and extended IBM's leadership position as a point-of-sale provider.  Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 30% year-to-year. We had strong revenue growth from our OEM customers in both networking and game consoles. For the year, Systems and Technology delivered 11% year-to-year revenue growth and increased both gross and pre-tax margins.
Turning to cash flow. We had very strong performance for the quarter and the full year. We generated $8.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up $1.5 billion year-to-year. The growth was driven by net income and working capital efficiencies. Strong collections and inventory management drove the majority of the year-to-year working capital improvements. 
On a full year basis, we generated $16.3 billion of free cash flow, which is growth of $1.2 billion over last year. We invested $4 billion in capital expenditures, up $200 million from last year, in support of new Hardware products and semiconductor technology. 
And remember, our full year free cash flow growth was significantly impacted by $700 million year-to-year due to unique onetime tax refunds as disclosed in previous quarters. 
When I look at uses of cash flow for the year, we spent almost $6 billion in acquisitions. That's net spending, up $4.7 billion from last year. This includes $2.9 billion of spending in the fourth quarter to acquire Netezza, Unica, BLADE Network, Clarity System, OpenPages and PSS Systems, so a very strong end of the year. 
In addition, we returned $18.6 billion to shareholders, including $3.2 billion in the form of dividends, up from $2.9 billion in 2009. And we bought back almost 118 million shares for $15.4 billion. At the end of the year, we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.7 billion, up $600 million from third quarter. Total debt was $28.6 billion of which nearly $23 billion was in support of our Financing business, which is leveraged at 7:1. 
So our non-financing debt was $5.8 billion, up $300 million from third quarter and up $2.1 billion from a year ago. At these debt levels, non-financing debt to cap was 23%, up from 16% a year ago. With this amount of leverage, we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility. Our balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term.
I'll wrap up the discussion of the fourth quarter with a summary of the drivers of our earnings per share performance. 
This quarter, 7% revenue growth made a strong contribution to our earnings growth, $0.24 year-to-year. Operating leverage, in this case driven by gross margin expansion, added $0.09, and lower share count contributed $0.26. For the full year, operating leverage was the largest contributor to our earnings growth, but we had good contribution from both revenue growth and share repurchase. All in, we delivered EPS of $11.52, our eighth consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth. 
So 2010 was a very good year for us. We improved revenue performance over the course of the year. And as you would expect, our transaction businesses led the improvements. Our growth initiatives also provided good lift. We relied on productivity initiatives to drive margin improvement above the model level, with pre-tax and net margins each up 80 basis points. 
Throughout the year, we continued to invest for innovation. This supported the introduction of our new System z mainframes and POWER7 products. We invested $6 billion to acquire 17 companies, adding significant capabilities to support our growth initiatives. We generated a lot of cash, over $16 billion, and we returned over $18 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. So overall, a strong year capping off a strong 2010 roadmap.
So now we'll move on to the 2015 roadmap. We're going to go through this in a lot more detail in our Investor Meeting in early March. 
I'll start with the transition to operating earnings, our new non-GAAP reporting format. We introduced this at our Investor Meeting back in May of 2010 and since then, provided supplemental information on this view in our second and third quarter earnings reports. And at the end of August, we published quarterly history for 2008, 2009 and 2010. We did that to give investors time to adjust their models before the beginning of 2011. We're providing 2011 expectation for operating EPS today. And starting with our first quarter '11 reporting in April, we will increase the focus on operating earnings in our earnings presentation. 
We introduced this new view of the business, because we believe operating earnings provide better transparency to our operating results. And because we're separately reporting the non-operating elements of pension, we'll provide more insight into our pension performance as well. I'll update you on our view of pension in just a minute. 
We believe that operating earnings also provides better comparison to our tech peers and by removing non-operating elements of pension, allows us to provide a better long-term view of the business. 
For 2010, our operating EPS was $11.67. That excludes the acquisition-related charges of $0.34 and excludes non-operating pension, which was income of $0.20 per share. The net difference between GAAP and operating EPS for 2010 is $0.15. So $11.67 is the base or the starting point for our 2015 roadmap objective.
I want to be clear that starting in 2011, operating earnings is the way we're running the business as we drive for at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015. Our management decisions will support operating earnings. The business units are driving for operating earnings. Our compensation is tied to operating performance. 
GAAP earnings, which include the non-operating pension and acquisition-related charges, will vary over time. For example, at current pension assumptions, in the early years, GAAP EPS growth will lag operating EPS growth. But in the later years of the roadmap, GAAP growth will be higher. You'll see these dynamics in the pension discussion.
So let me spend a couple of minutes on pension to give you an update on the operating and non-operating performance. I'm using the same format we used at the May Investor Meeting. Let's start with operating cost, which consists of service cost and defined contribution cost. 
As we've showed you in May, these costs are relatively stable at just under $2 billion per year. The corresponding cash is also stable through time. These costs are included in our operating earnings definition as they are labor costs associated with running our business. 
Now I'll turn to the non-operating elements, which are primarily those related to changes in plan assets and liabilities and are most dependent on discount rate movements and return on assets.
From a financial perspective, we're focused on the cash, balance sheet and funding implications, not the I&E, so funded status is very important. At the end of 2010, our defined benefit tax qualified plans were well funded, with our U.S. plans fully funded at 101%, consistent with December 2009, and our global plans at 99%. 
There are a number of factors that contribute to this. Despite volatile market conditions, global asset returned to a strong at almost 12%. This is the second consecutive year of strong performance. Looking forward, we'll take our average expected long-term return assumption to 7.3% and reduce our discount rate to 4.7%, reflecting the current interest rate environment.
While these market dynamics had generated some near-term impact to non-operating cost, cost over the longer term has improved, with 2015 actually better than discussed in May, while cash remains, as you can see, relatively unaffected. We now expect 2011 non-operating pension to be down $400 million year-to-year. This is $100 million more of an impact than we showed you in May due to the decline in discount rates in 2010. 
Looking over the roadmap, based on 2010 assumptions, we now expect about $100 million of income from non-operating pension in 2015. This is better than what we showed you in May by $400 million due to strong asset returns.
But what is really important is cash. And despite the volatility in the GAAP I&E, cash remains stable to improving over time. 2011 non-operating cash requirements are $100 million better than we showed in May, with 2015 unchanged. 
Here, you can see clearly the year-to-year impact on GAAP earnings versus the cash requirements. Based on year end 2010 assumptions, non-operating pension will impact year-to-year GAAP earnings growth through 2013. But starting in 2013, this reverses, and non-operating pension would benefit the year-to-year GAAP earnings growth. So by 2015, non-operating pension returns to an income to the P&L. But as I said, there is very little year-to-year impact on cash. In fact, the cash requirements would be stable through 2013 and improve slightly by 2015, so much more stable over time. 
Bottom line, we're managing our business to drive operating earnings over the long term. And from a financial perspective, we're focused on the cash and balance sheet implications for pension assets and liabilities.
So now let's summarize our new roadmap, with an objective of at least $20 of operating earnings per share in 2015. As in our last roadmap, we've identified the major drivers of performance: revenue growth, operating leverage and share repurchase. The revenue growth comes from a combination of base revenue growth, a mix of faster growing businesses and acquisitions closed between 2010 and 2015. The operating leverage will come from both shift to higher-margin businesses and enterprise productivity. 
We're driving for $8 billion of productivity over the next five years, part will go to the bottom line and part to drive competitiveness in the marketplace. And we'll continue to return value to shareholders, with $50 billion as share repurchase and $20 billion as dividends. 
Overall, you'll see that we expect fairly balanced contribution from revenue growth, operating leverage and share repurchase. And just as in the 2010 roadmap, we're relying on the resilience of our business model to drive the overall objective of at least $20 of operating EPS. 
2011 will be our first step towards this 2015 objective. We entered the year with a strong portfolio of offerings, momentum in our key growth initiatives, a solid operating model and a strong financial position. We expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $13 for the year, which, at 11% growth, is right on track to achieve at least $20 of operating earnings per share in 2015. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research
I was wondering if you could comment -- you had mentioned on the conference call that you basically had once-in-a-decade type performance in two key areas of your business: Systems and Technology, particularly mainframe and in Services signings. Is that building momentum? Or is there any risk that you had a uniquely strong quarter that either pulled in from a week Q3 or potentially from Q1? And how are you thinking about performance in each of those areas in Q1 and Q2 of 2011?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, great question, Toni. I think this is an indication, from our perspective, of the momentum that we're building as we enter 2011. So let me -- per your question, let's walk down it by element. If you look at the first quarter of 2011, I expect that as we've studied it, it will be very similar in nature to our fourth quarter. In other words, really driven by the Hardware and Software transactional elements of our business. So as we go from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, once again, we expect to see a double-digit revenue growth out of both the Hardware and Software sides of our business. And on the Services side of the business, with the increase that we saw in our backlog, again up $4 billion year-to-year, up $7 billion quarter-to-quarter, and we move into the first quarter, we would expect to see an improvement in our revenue growth rate in the first compared to the fourth and have that extend through the year now at a modest rate, because it's driven more by backlog than just the more volatile elements of signings. And with the margin performance that we expect based on the actions we're taking, we would expect to have kind of mid-single digit growth in our Services business profitability. So if you look at that, I would interpret that as kind of an extension of the momentum that we see. If you look at the Hardware content in a little more detail, we had just a great start to the zSeries rollout. And as we look at the opportunity on both the Hardware side, whether that be that z content, p content, X series, we see momentum going into the first, as we do on our Software side. So everything we look at looks like a characterization that's more similar. Now the one element I'll point out, in the fourth quarter of the year, those Hardware and Software transactional businesses are about 50% of the business, and the annuity content is about 50%. When we go into the first quarter, just given the seasonality of those individual businesses, it's really characterized more by like 60% on the Services side and 40% on the Hardware and Software side. But we anticipate that this is an indication of momentum going into 2011.
Patricia Murphy
Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital
With regard to earnings, you're talking about close to 12% non-GAAP EPS growth or operating EPS growth. Can you just talk about the quarterly distribution as we go throughout the year? The comps are pretty comparable on a gross basis but maybe what you're seeing in terms of seasonality. And then if you could also just comment on whether the movement to non-GAAP makes it easier to make acquisitions, that'll be great, considering it will freeze up the potential penalties.
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Let me first talk about the distribution through 2011. On the operating growth rate of 11%, I'd reiterate that 11%, it puts us right on that plumb line that you might draw from 2010 to our 2015 objective of about $20. But around that, given the momentum that we're entering like our strong product set and opportunity set, I would expect the first half of the year to be a point or two stronger than that. And with that, the back half of the year could be a point or two points less than that. By the fourth quarter of next year, we'll be wrapping around on this very powerful fourth quarter that we had this year. Now remember that, that 11% is our at-least number. So it's an implication of what we see in the distribution of at least. So I think that's a fair reflection. Now if you look at the structure of our GAAP versus non-GAAP content that we would call our operating view of the business, really, that was intended. And I think it's very appropriate to show how our operating units are performing without being distracted by the noncash, non-operational elements, either in our pension content or in acquisitions. So I wouldn't say it makes it easier to do acquisitions, but I do think it gives a better operational indication of performance of the business and a better way to gauge and measure our performance on our way to 2015.
Patricia Murphy
Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Do you view the $22 billion of signings this quarter as indication of a clear change in momentum for the services industry? And in that context, is growth in Services signings likely in 2011?
Mark Loughridge
Well, if you look at the Services content, as we have pointed out before, no, they're not evenly distributed through a year, right? So it can be kind of more volatile. Some would say, from some perspective, a little less predictable. That's why we did the analysis, Katy, within our announcement today, and we did the analysis on the relative stability of backlog compared to signings. Now that said, I thought we did have a terrific, just a terrific quarter on signings, I mean, $22 billion, up 18%; outsourcing, up 24%; our transactional business up 8% behind that. I'm telling you, we had really strong performance against expanding opportunities in the growth markets. I mean, our signings and growth markets were up more than 250%. I mean, imagine that, big contracts like the Bharti contract in Africa rolling out. So I do think we have a strong opportunity set going forward. We're excited about that opportunity content. But if you look at the drivers behind performance, especially in the Outsourcing side, I would be looking at the dynamics behind backlog more than I would necessarily signings.
Patricia Murphy
Cynthia, next question please.

The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Caris & Company.
Robert Cihra - Caris & Company
If you just -- even given how strong your Hardware business was in the quarter, obviously, driven by mainframe, the POWER server was relatively soft even with the new products cycle through the year end, the high end in the quarter. I mean, is there any -- it would seem like about as good a quarter as you can have given your product cycles. Is it just indicative that the UNIX market is that slow even with you gaining share? Or is there anything else going on in the quarter?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, let's talk a little bit about -- first of all, no question about it, we had a great, great quarter on our System z rollout. It's just really, really powerful across the board, but let's talk about System p. So first of all, for all of system technology and for p individually, we're talking about three points of share gain. So that's very strong share performance for the group as a whole and for pSeries individually. But I'd take it at the components of p to better understand how we view the dynamics. So on our new entry p, I mean, we were up 30% in the quarter, and even at 30%, we were sold out on a number of models. So p, at our entry kind of had very, very strong reception in the marketplace. Our mid-range was up 70%. Now that's the third quarter that we have had really strong growth in the mid-range content that we introduced at the beginning of the year. Our high-end content, and this high end is one of the -- is the biggest UNIX server in the industry. It does have a longer sell cycle behind it. But if you look at the quarter-to-quarter dynamics, I mean, we did 3x the high-end content in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of the year. So we think with that, we have a lot of momentum on all three elements: the entry content, the mid-range and now the high end. I'd also remind you that as we looked at the competitive displacements, for the year, we had $1 billion of competitive displacements across the platforms, and within that, about 10% was X86. So we didn't just take displacements away from competition in the UNIX space, we also took away from them in the X86 space. So I think p had a very nice quarter, and again, I think it has a lot of momentum as we go into the first quarter of '11.

The next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
I was wondering if we could just look at the Services again just maybe from a different angle heading into 2011. Maybe you could talk about any differences or any changes that you're seeing in that business heading into 2011 versus where you were heading into 2010.
Mark Loughridge
Well, first of all, going into 2011, I want to highlight that we start the year -- again, we started the year with a very strong backlog of business, up $4 billion year-to-year. And that $4 billion puts us in a good starting point as we go in the year. Secondly, if you look at the outsourcing content, the analysis we did, we showed you for the first time, analysis on that first year rollout behind the backlog, and you could see in that rollout on the outsourcing content that was up about 3%. And that accounts for about 85% of the revenue in the Outsourcing business, so a strong statement there as well. And then the last thing I would reiterate, we had really, really strong signings performance again in the growth markets, which I think is an indication of how that opportunity set is opening for us. And the best example, I think, really is the Bharti contract we have in Africa.
Patricia Murphy

The next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
John Slack
This is John Slack from Richard's team. Wondering if you could give a little more color on -- words on the drivers there from a product failing perspective?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, if you look at the Software side of the business, again, adjusted for the divested PLM content, WebSphere was up 34%, very, very strong performance there. Information Management was up 12%, as well as Rational, Tivoli up 14%. So across the Key Branded Middleware, very strong performance. But I think one of the aspects that I would draw your attention to are really the cross business unit big initiatives that we're driving for growth. And we covered this at our Analyst Meeting in May, like Business Analytics, growth markets, Smarter Planet and cloud. Those are initiatives that cut across the businesses with services content, software content, hardware content, that they had big implications to the performance in our Software business. So as an example, Business Analytics was up 19%. Our growth market's up 13%. Smarter Planet -- I mean, we did up $3 billion in Smarter Planet, up double digits. Cloud, we had thousands of engagements, and it should be doubling as we go through 2015, emphasizing our focus on the enterprise and security of the data set within that enterprise. So I think it's not just a story of how the Key Branded Middleware elements perform, it's also how those key growth initiatives that cut across the businesses performed as well, and we had a very strong fourth there.

The next question comes from Moshe Katri from Cowen and Company.
Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC
What sort of revenue growth and margins are embedded in your 2011 EPS guidance?
Mark Loughridge
Well, we generally don't give revenue guidance, and I think that's a function of how we built the longer-term models. If you look at the longer-term model, it's a combination of our emphasis on revenue, in our investments, on our key growth initiatives. It's our margin expansion as we mix to higher-margin elements of the portfolio and drive efficiencies in running our business. It's how we utilize capital for share repurchase. So I don't think one element, such as revenue, tells the story as effectively as it does if you stick to the roadmap content in EPS. So if you look at the roadmap, I think we had a strong performance in the fourth quarter relative to that, 7% revenue growth, a couple of points stronger than the model objective of about 5%. We had good margin expansion in the year, both net and PTI, up 8/10 point and good share repurchase. So going into the first quarter, however, I go back to the comments that I'd made by business unit. So going into the first, we see double-digit revenue performance across the Hardware and Software content and an improving vector on revenue growth for our Services business, albeit at a modest slope, as we go through the year, taking into consideration that, that mix between Services and the Hardware-Software transaction was more like a 60-40 mix than 50-50 in the fourth quarter. But all of those indicate momentum, in my opinion.

The next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Collins Stewart.
Louis Miscioscia - Collins Stewart LLC
We've heard about accelerating trends in Europe and obviously, it looks like with European performance that actually came through, and obviously, you had the same here in the U.S. Maybe if you can give us a comment as to what CEOs are thinking both in the first half and the second half of the year. Should we see and expect increasing and accelerating IT spending?
Mark Loughridge
Well, rather than describe this in terms of IT spend in the industry, I would look at it more on the performance that we had in our own business unit now, and that kind of has a number of elements. First of all, in the fourth, I thought the major markets did a great job and showed the results of the investments that we've made and more stability in the economic environment, but it isn't just the economic environment. You've got to really point to the performance of those individual businesses. So the U.S. was up 10%. France was up 17%. We had good growth in Italy. We had good growth in Spain. So the major markets had real performance in the fourth quarter that we're encouraged by as we entered 2011. As well, growth markets up 13% maintained that eight-point differential to the major markets. As I had said earlier, we had signings greater than 250%. The BRIC countries were up 17%. China was up 25%, so real momentum that we think is ongoing in the growth markets as well.

The next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
The industry seems to be evolving towards this integrated software and hardware positioning, and you're seeing it in all sorts of acquisitions in the market. I'm just curious, when you look at the strength you had in Software and obviously, the strength you had in Hardware, and you wrap analytics in, can you maybe talk a little bit about what are the drivers that drive these competitive displacements?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, I think, first of all, I do think that integrated play is a very strong play. And if you look at the industry, nobody has that hardware, software, services complement the way we do. Now you may see a lot of businesses putting together strategies along that perspective or describing that future state in that perspective, but if you just look at who's doing it right now, it's really IBM with that hardware, software, services complement. And you don't build that overnight. We've been working on this for decades. Secondly, I think it's really the strength of those cross-business unit growth initiatives, and I would return to make the point that in Business Analytics, that cuts across our businesses: growth at 19%; growth markets, 13%;  our Smarter Planet content, we did $3 billion, up double digit; cloud, again, with thousands of engagements, doubling to 2015. So one, nobody has that complement of hardware, software and services the way we do. Number two, it takes a long time to build that. We've been at this for decades. And three, we have very strong growth initiatives that could cut across those businesses, consistent with our strategy.

The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus.
David Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Mark, 2010 was a very robust year for acquisitions, and I think you stated that you expect 2% or so annual growth from acquisitions. Is that an assumption based on run rate revenue when you acquire it? And if not, how should we think about the integration periods and growth rates of acquired companies, particularly given that the size of the deals that you're doing are increasing?
Mark Loughridge
Yes. If you look at acquisitions, we kind of gave a framework for how we look at acquisition performance over the lifespan. And within that, we're very, very focused on the acceleration of both their revenue growth and also their ability to be accretive to IBM by that second year. So when you look at the deal review meetings that we run, generally on a weekly basis, I would look at it and say the internal rate return of the deal and the payback of the deal are table stakes. If you don't have those, don't even show up at the meeting, because these are financial transactions for us. We don't do ""strategic transactions"" that don't meet our financial objectives. But the real meat of the decision process is the due diligence and that integration plan to accelerate in those first two years. And it's against those objectives that I think we've been really pretty successful.
Patricia Murphy
Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
There are no further questions in queue.
Mark Loughridge
Great. Well, thank you very much for joining us. Let me just make a few comments to wrap up the call. 
We just delivered a great quarter to cap off a great year. Our revenue growth of 7% was the best of the decade, driven by our Hardware and Software transaction businesses. We expanded margins and delivered 16% growth in earnings per share. We grew free cash flow $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter and generated over $16 billion for the year. 
So now we've finished our 2010 roadmap. We exceeded the high end of the objective by more than $0.50 despite the headwinds created by the recession. As you look at 2011, we're entering with a lot going for us: a great hardware lineup; strong momentum in Software; backlog growth in Services; momentum in the growth markets; an ongoing productivity initiatives; and a rock-solid balance sheet. So this supports our expectation of at least $13 of operating EPS for the year. That's 11% TGR and puts us right on track to deliver at least $20 in 2015. 
So thanks for joining us, and now as always, it's back to work.

Mark Loughridge
Thank you for joining us today. This quarter we improved our revenue growth rate, expanded gross, pre-tax and net margins and delivered earnings per share of $2.82 up 18% year-to-year and this EPS growth was on top of a very strong performance in the third quarter of 2009 which was also up 18%. We achieved all of this while investing to drive future growth and delivering strong shareholder returns. Revenue growth of 4% at constant currency was up two points from our second quarter growth rate, continuing the trend of improving business performance.
Growth markets had a great quarter, up 13% at constant currency. We've been investing to expand in the new regions and build out IT infrastructure in support of the economic growth. Since the technology had its best revenue growth in six years up 10% and profit was up 46%, capitalizing on new product introductions and continued strong growth in 
System x, midrange Power, and storage. We had good growth in Global Business Services. Revenue was up 5% year-to-year. Our transactional signings returned to growth and we’ve been investing in resources in key opportunity areas like business analytics. Across IBM, which includes services and software, business analytics revenue was up 14% year-to-year.
Overall, we delivered $24.3 billion of revenue; that’s up 3% as reported and 4% at constant currency. And once again we had good profit and margin performance. We expanded gross margins by 20 basis points, driven by better margins in Software and Systems and Technology. Our expense was up 1% year-to-year. Underneath this, our operational expense performance was better by a point. We increased pre-tax income by 7%, and pre-tax margin was up 70 basis points to 19.3%. Our third quarter tax rate reflects an updated view of the full year rate to 25%. Our net income was up 12%, and margin expanded over a point to 14.8%. Finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a reduction in our share count of 5%.
All of this contributed to earnings per share of $2.82, up 18% from a year ago. We’ve now had 31 consecutive quarters of EPS growth.
Based on this performance, and our view of the fourth quarter, we are increasing our expectation for the full year of 2010 to at least $11.40 of earnings per share. That’s up $0.15 from our previous view of at least $11.25 in July and represents a 14% year-to-year increase over 2009.
Now I’ll turn to the revenue details starting with a geographic view where I’ll focus my comments on constant currency. 
We again had an improving trend in year-to-year revenue growth rate from the second to the third quarter across our geographies, with the Americas better by a point, Europe by two points and Asia Pacific by four points.
In the major markets, we significantly improved the year-to-year growth rate in Canada, France, Germany and Italy and continued our strong performance in the U.K. So we’re encouraged by what we’re seeing in several of the major market countries. The U.S. growth was consistent with second quarter levels and Japan posted very modest growth for the first time in 12 quarters.
As I mentioned in the opening, our growth markets had terrific performance, up 13%, which outpaced the majors by 12 points. The combined revenue in the BRIC countries was up 26%, with strong growth in each of the four countries. Brazil was up 15%, Russia 56%, India up 15%, and China, up 36%.
A few years ago we established a play to capture the opportunity in the growth markets and our investments are really paying off. We have three growth strategies that were aimed at creating new markets. Now you may recall that Bruno Di Leo, our General Manager of the Growth Markets discussed these at our Investor Briefing in May, and I want to spend a minute describing our results this quarter in the context of these strategies.
First, Market Expansion, which is about reaching new clients and new enterprises, expanding into new countries and into new territories. We’ve prioritized 16 countries for investment beyond the BRICs. Together with the BRICs, the “Growth Markets 20” grew 13% this quarter and we had 32 countries within the growth markets that grew double digits. 
Historically, the vast majority of the revenue within these countries came from relatively few cities. To increase coverage in new territories, we have a systematic approach to opening branch offices in new cities while leveraging the global infrastructure. Year to date, we have opened 40 branch offices bringing our total to 103 in the Growth Markets. This quarter, the fastest growth came from these new expansion territories.
The second strategy is IT Infrastructure Development in support of economic growth. Each year tens of millions of people are moving from rural areas into cities. This creates a demand for banking, telecommunications, transportation, and energy. Our strategy is to provide the IT that supports the build-out of this infrastructure. That means high-end systems, software solutions and large services projects. 
Now here are a couple of examples of the kind of work we’re doing. In China, IBM and Peking University People’s Hospital have built an evidence-based, patient-centric care system to enable resource sharing among service providers for improved patient care. And in India, IBM has delivered to Keonics a mainframe-based education solution to enable the government client to offer a more sophisticated, advanced technical curriculum to their corporate clients. We’re seeing the benefit of the IT infrastructure work in our systems results. This quarter, we had 25% growth in total Systems and Technology, with almost 30% in servers. This led to share gains in Systems and Technology as well as our Growth Markets overall.
The third strategy is to develop Industry Leadership in selected industries which we believe are most relevant in the growth markets; Banking, Energy & Utilities, Healthcare, Transportation & Rail and Natural Resources. 
We’ve been investing in industry specific skills by both hiring, and deepening our employee skill sets. In the third quarter, we had 21% combined growth in these industries and double-digit growth in four of the five. 
With this strategy and the investments we’re making, we expect performance in the growth markets to continue to outpace the major markets and to continue to grow faster than the market overall.
Turning to revenue by segment, as expected, the services business continued to improve its revenue growth at constant currency. The biggest lift came from Global Business Services. The growth rate is up 3 points from second quarter to 5% year-to-year growth in the third. Global Technology Services which has a higher percentage of long-term annuity content, improved to 1%.
Our software growth was in line with last quarter. Software grew 6% at constant currency excluding the divested PLM operations, a view that best represents our ongoing business. 
Software growth continues to be led by key areas like business analytics, storage management and business integration.
The strongest growth came from our Systems and Technology business, up 10%. Our System z mainframes were up 15%, capitalizing on a new product introduction and strong performance in the growth markets. Midrange Power had double-digit growth. Storage had double-digit growth in disk, and System x once again posted very strong growth. I’ll get into more details when we discuss the segments.
Turning to expense, our Total Expense and Other Income was up 1%. With a 3% increase in revenue, our expense-to-revenue ratio improved a half of a point year-to-year.
The expense increase was driven entirely by acquisitions, which drove a 3 point year-to-year increase. 
We’ve been investing in acquisitions to build our skills and technology in support of our growth initiatives such as business analytics, and cloud computing. Through the third quarter, we’ve closed 11 acquisitions for a total of about $3 billion. This higher level of acquisition expense was mitigated by currency, which improved expense by one point.
And finally, we had a 1 point improvement in operational expense. With our ongoing focus on driving more productivity and efficiency in our spending base, this is now the ninth consecutive quarter of operational expense improvement. 
Underneath this, we’ve been increasing investment in several areas. I’ll give you a few examples. We’re investing in industry sales skills to support Smarter Planet. We’re building sales capabilities for business analytics and have established eight analytics solution centers around the world. We’re investing in development, sales and marketing to support our new high end technology introductions. And we’re continuing to deploy sales resource and build sales enablement to drive growth market performance. This quarter the SG&A and the growth markets excluding currency and acquisitions is up 7% year-to-year while overall IBM is flat.
Bottom line, we’ve been able to drive a higher level of investment in these initiatives while still expanding margin. To wrap up the expense discussion this quarter there are no items that provide significant impacts or benefits to our profit growth. The year-to-year change in other income and expenses driven by the combination of charges in the third quarter of last year for investment losses and a gain this quarter associated with the disposition of a joint venture; none of these items are material. We had no significant gains or losses from our hedging programs either into period or year-to-year.
Now before turning to the segment discussions, we’ve got a snapshot of our margin and price segment. Once again our margin expansion was broad based both services segments improved pre-tax profit margin, software gross margin was up a point and pre-tax margin was flat at 32.1%. Systems and technology expansion was driven by improvements in microelectronics and storage, and global financing margin improvement reflects the interest rate environment and higher margin on equipment sales.
So now moving on to the segment details, the two services segments delivered $14.1 billion of revenue up to 2% at constant currency. Global business services grew 5% at constant currency and global technology services grew 1% at constant currency. Both segments had sequential improvement in the year-to-year constant currency revenue growth rates versus second quarter and both segments grew pre-tax income and expanded pre-tax margin year-to-year.
Transactional Signings were $5.4 billion up 4%, this was driven by Global Business Services which was up 7%. Outsourcing signings were $5.7 billion down 14% at constant currency. Including a deal we signed on October 8, we would have reported outsourcing growth of 14% at constant currency and this would have increased the total signings reported from $11 billion to $12.7 billion. It’s very difficult to predict precisely when these deals will close and 8 days is not going to make any difference in the yield to this contract which kicks in quickly in the fourth quarter. Back log was 134 billion worth a very low level of erosion; this is up $5 billion from the second quarter and flat year-to-year at actual rates. 
At constant currency backlog is also flat year-to-year and down 2 billion quarter-to-quarter. This quarter we signed ten deals over $100 million. Now let’s move on to the two segments, in Global Technology Services revenue was $9.5 billion, GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% at constant currency in the quarter and Integrated Technology Services revenue was down 1% at constant currency. 
Both of these represent an improvement over the second quarter. Global Technology Services pre-tax income was up 4% and pre-tax margin expanded to 15.5%. Turning to global business and services revenue was $4.6 billion up 5%. This was the best growth since the third quarter of 2008. We delivered improved revenue growth in many areas of the business with sequential improvement in the growth rates of both the major markets and the growth markets and across our key offerings of core consulting, application management outsourcing and systems integration. 
In fact, we gained share in consulting, held share in AMS and gained share for total GBS. We’re getting good traction in smaller deals in GBS, particularly in areas that help customers drive global integration, drive efficiency and standardization, and deliver cost savings. These smaller deals are helping to fuel near-term revenue performance.
We had good performance in our growth initiatives in GBS. We grew revenue and transactional signings in the growth markets and GBS had revenue growth of almost 40% in Business Analytics. With increased client demand for a specific industry knowledge, we’ve added 2000 consultants in the last two quarters and now have over 7000 dedicated consultants in our Business Analytics practice. 
Global Business Services pretax profit was up 5% year-to-year with margin expanding to 14.6%. The continued rollout of our globally integrated capabilities and good delivery performance are adding to margin. At the same time, we are increasing resource spending to support future growth. To wrap up Services, GTS improved revenue growth to 1% of constant currency and at 5% GBS had the highest level of revenue growth since 2008, and gained share. 
Software revenue of $5.2 billion was up 1% year-to-year and 2% of constant currency. Software grew 6% of constant currency adjusting for the divestiture of PLM, which is a more appropriate view of our ongoing business. Key Branded Middleware grew 7% at actual rates and 8% at constant currency and gained share for the 12th straight quarter as we continued to enhance our lead in the middleware market. We gained share in four of our five Key Branded Middleware brands. Gross margin was up over a point and pretax margin was flat at 32%.
Now, let me take you through the brands. WebSphere had another terrific quarter growing 14% or 16% at constant currency. The WebSphere software portfolio connects business processes and delivers application infrastructures in an SOA environment. ILOG, which provides business rules management, grew about 30%. WebSphere Commerce provides a scalable, unified platform to drive sales into retail, B2B and business partner marketplace. We had real strength there with strong double-digit growth. With our recent acquisitions of Sterling, Coremetrics and Unica, we expect continued market momentum in this space. 
Information Management also had a strong quarter growing 5%, or 7% of constant currency. Relational Database was up 5% of constant currency, driven by a 7% constant currency growth in distributed database. Information Management provides the foundation for IBM’s Business Analytics and Optimization offerings. We continue to expand our Information Management capabilities both organically and through acquisitions. We expect to close on the purchases of Netezza and OpenPages in the fourth quarter.
Tivoli had another good quarter, growing 9%, or 11% of constant currency. Tivoli provides an integrated approach to service management. This quarter, we had solid growth in two elements of our Integrated Service management strategy. Storage management, which was up 20%, and Security, also up double digits. Lotus returned to modest constant currency growth. Rational also grew at 1% of constant currency and gained share. Our software business had a solid quarter, and is well positioned as we enter the fourth quarter.
Systems and Technology revenue was $4.3 billion, up 10% year-to-year or 11% at constant currency. Revenue was driven by double-digit growth in System z, mid-range power System x, disc storage and microelectronics. We had very strong performance in the growth market, up 25% at constant currency. BRIC countries grew over 40% with double-digit growth in all brands. Gross profit margin expanded 1 point and PTI margin expanded almost 2 points with 46% growth in pre-tax income.
Now let me take you through more details on the brands. System z revenue grew 15% year-to-year and gained share. MIPS grew 54%, the highest growth in six years. Late in the third quarter we shipped to zEnterprise 196 server which delivers 40% more performance than the z10. This performance is driven by the world’s fastest processor which operates at more than 5 gigahertz. In the fourth quarter we will began shipping the zBX, IBM’s first system of systems. zBX extends mainframe governments to select Power7 and System x blades. Power system’s revenue declined 13% year-to-year and continued to be the market leader by a wide margin.
We first introduced Power7 into the mid-range during the first quarter and in the third quarter mid-range systems grew 11%. We continued the rollout of Power7 with the high end and entry products in mid September. Shipments were limited though with just two weeks of general availability in the quarter. Our competitive takeouts continued in the third quarter. We drove over 250 competitive units displacements which resulted in approximately $225 million of business. Storage hardware revenue grew 7% year-to-year or 8% at constant currency and held share. Storage revenue in our growth markets was up 23%. This grew 14% driven by a continued strength in high end storage, DSA1000 and XIV. We added more than 130 new customers to our XIV platform in the third quarter and XIV hardware revenue nearly doubled, tape declined 8% but gained share this quarter.
Taking a broader look at our storage performance, our storage hardware together with storage software grew 10%. System x revenue grew 30% year-to-year and gained share, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-to-year revenue growth of 30% or better. The high end of System x was up 27% and gained share. Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 28% year-to-year. We had strong revenue growth from our OEM customers in networking and wireless communications infrastructure. Overall this quarter’s systems and technology delivered double-digit revenue growth, expanded margins and grew profit 46%.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, down $200 million year-to-year driven by increased receivables associated with a higher level of revenue. Our collection performance remained strong. Through the first three quarters our free cash flow of $7.6 billion was $300 million year-to-year driven by higher capital investments for new hardware products and semiconductor technology and a year-to-year impact of over $700 million for unique one-time tax refunds as previously disclosed.
Adjusting for this unique tax refunds free cash flow would have been up over $400 million year-to-year. Looking at the year-to-date uses of cash, we spent $3 billion in acquisitions in support of our growth strategy. In addition, we had returned over $14 billion to shareholders, $2.4 billion in the form of dividends and $11.8 billion in share repurchases. We have $2.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.1 billion more than two-thirds of which was in the US. Total debt was $27.5 billion. $22 billion of debt was in support of our financing business which is leveraged at 7.1 to 1. $5.5 billion was non-financing debt that was up from $2.5 billion a year ago. 
Non-financing debt-to-cap was 22%, up from 16% at the end of last year and 14% a year ago. With this amount of leverage, we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility to execute our strategy. 
The balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long-term. I’ll start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings-per-share performance. This quarter all categories positively contributed to our earnings growth. Our revenue growth, at constant mix and margin, contributed $0.07. Operating leverage contributed $0.21 and a 5% reduction in share count contributed $0.14. So once again, our growth was delivered through a combination of revenue growth, margin expansion, and an effective use of cash. 
I said at the beginning of the call that our 18% earnings growth was on top of a strong 2009. If you look back further to the third quarter of 2006, we delivered $1.45 of earnings per share. So we’ve almost doubled the level of earnings per share in four years. And based on our expectations for 2010, we'll almost double full year EPS over the last four years as well. So it’s pretty clear that we have consistently delivered strong earnings growth. 
This quarter, we continued the trend of improving business performance. By segment, the improvement was led by Systems and Technology and Global Business Services, up 10% and 5% respectively. From a geographic perspective, we had outstanding performance in the growth markets with 13% growth as we execute our market expansion plans. 
We again expanded margins, gross up two-tenths of a point, pre-tax seven-tenths, and net margin up 1.1 points. We continued a strong pace of investment; in SG&A to capture the growth in emerging markets, in R&D and capital to support product introductions, and in acquisitions to add to our capabilities in areas like business analytics and cloud computing. Bottom line, we delivered $2.82 of earnings per share. 
So, to sum up the quarter, we continued our steady improvement in the business, in both revenue growth and margin expansion, and we used our strong profit and cash position to invest for future growth, while returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share buyback. All of this supports our expectation of at least $11.40 of earnings per share for the year. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A I’d like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I’ll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time I would like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question. 
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Mark I was hoping you could address two likely concerns that investors may have from your results this quarter. The first one is that your lower tax rate I think adds about $0.16 relative to your prior tax rate to earnings in the second half. You raised guidance by $0.15. How should we think about that in terms of your confidence relative to a quarter ago? 
And the second issue I would like you to try and address is the quarterly signing. For your last three quarters worth of signings, year-over-year you are down 7%. You have missed your signings estimate effectively for three straight quarters. Should investors be worried given that signings growth is often a good leading indictor of future services growth? Can you address this question as well?
Mark Loughridge

Yes, let me take your first question Tony on the lower tax rate. The benefit of the lower tax rate in the quarter was $0.10. The benefit over the balance of the year will be another $0.05, so its $0.15. So we raised the guidance consistent with that tax rate benefit. And we view tax rate as an operational line item like any other. 
And I'd add that as we look at our tax position, we see that extending into the 2015 roadmap. If you remember, the tax rate that we looked at an operational basis was 25.5% and we see that now closer to 25%. So, operational execution on optimizing our tax position not only for the year but extending into the 2015 roadmap. At $11.40, we were up 14%. That’s a very strong year, and it's against some very strong years historically. So if you look at it since announcing the road map at $11.40, and that’s an at least number, Tony, that's almost doubling the $6.05 that we quoted when we closed out 2006. I think the roadmap has been effective, I think it caps of the year at pretty strong position, and I think we got a very good play as we move into the fourth quarter. 
So now let me go to your second question on quarterly signings. First of all, let's look at the shorter term content. In short-term signings, we are really pretty good. They are 4% and the GBS content was up 7%. So this is consistent with our expectations. As you saw, we had much better revenue performance this quarter of our GBS business. We expect that to continue as we go into our fourth quarter.
The real issue is around outsourcing. Signings are down 14% but with the big deal on October 8th, this would have been up 14%. So now we are talking about eight days. Had this signed on the 30th, we frankly wouldn’t be having this conversation. And though the contract does have good yield in the quarter because a lot of that contract is absolutely new content that kicks in the fourth quarter, it's not an extension that the extension in the time-wise and an extension in scope that we get to [start quoting]. Initially about half of that is actually new content for us.
The performance now that we get in the fourth quarter isn’t going to be any different whether we have signed it in September 30th, October 8th. And the reason it delayed out to October 8th was frankly pretty good reasons as we expanded scope and got lot more opportunity; very successful deal for us. 
You know if you look at outsourcing dynamics overall, you see that at the beginning of the quarter the revenue is really driven more by backlog and signings are really just one input to backlog. In addition to duration mix of new versus extension, the mix of new within extension like the deal that I was discussing, erosion growth in the base here, there is a lot of content that goes in to that backlog, but it’s really backlog that establishes where you are going to be in that next quarter more than signings.
I look at signing as an impact of that broader perspective not that the base driver. So going into the fourth there is really only by 5% to 6% of outsourcing revenue coming from new perspective signings. And it’s IBM that represents less than 1% of IBM’s profit. So if you look at the role the way I look at it for our outsourcing business, its big, its powerful; annuity base business provides real stability throws off a lot of profit in cash but it moves more slowly. You just don’t see big swings like you would in transactional businesses.
So the signings number report has really very low impact on the revenue in near term and even less influence on profit. So it’s really that annuity characteristic or the portfolio over the longer term gives you a lot of time to deal with changing revenue dynamics and your game plan to exploit your opportunity of deals and we do have a strong deal list for outsourcing business going into the fourth quarter and add in addition to the large deal we signed on the 8th. We have the big Bharti deal in Africa that now expands into a new continent.
But in the fourth quarter our performance, as we look forward, is going to continue to be driven by the more dynamic elements of our product portfolio and the transactional elements of the business like hardware which is up 11% in the third, software that was up 6%, consulting that was up 6%, North America consulting rose up 9%, and we expect to see those trends continue and if anything I think though GTS, GBS and hardware will probably be consistent growth rates of the fourth compared to third, I do think that we are going to see an acceleration in our software business and our software growth rate going in the fourth to the cap of a strong year.

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital, you may ask your question.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital
Hey thanks a lot I appreciate it. Mark, during the quarter that pretty cautious comment and…
Patricia Murphy
Ben can you speak up a little bit, it’s hard to hear you.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital 
Okay, can you hear me now?
Patricia Murphy
Yes sir
Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital 
I just wanted to talk about the economy in the IT market how are you seeing things, there was some talk during the quarter was, did those things slow down, your hardware business actually picked up that lot better. How would you say you feel about your prospects into the fourth quarter from the macro standpoint where IBM fits in?
Mark Loughridge
 
Yes, good question Ben, now if you look at the performance in the quarter let’s start with the major markets, in north America we are up 2%, that was improvement in the growth rate compared to the second quarter over point. In Europe we are up 1%, that was improvement of 2 points compared to the growth rate in the second quarter, Japan returned to growth for the first time in a long time. So the major markets did improve, there was lower rate of improvement compared to growth markets. The real slugger in the quarter was GMU, growth markets up 13%, that’s 4 points stronger than we had seen in the second quarter and that gives us a differential.
Now to the major market are 12%, now we have been quoting that number for sometime, do you remember through 08’ and 09’ our growth markets were generally about 8 points plus or minus point better than major market performance but growth markets now 12 point better that’s very, very strong, BRICs up 26% they were nine points better then we saw in the second quarter. So, looking at that data I would have to conclude that one; we called the right play going after the growth markets with strong investment content lets play that opportunity and I think on the recovery basis you know the growth markets are simply out of the box faster than the majors.

The next question comes from Kathryn Huberty with Morgan Stanley, you may ask your question.
Kathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Thanks, good afternoon Mark, how would you characterize the impact you’re expecting from the P&Z systems product cycle versus the revenue impact you’ve seen impact cycles and then in the same regard what inning do you think the industry is in as it relates to just the overall general refresh of IT systems that we’ve seen this year?
Mark Loughridge

Okay, well let’s talk about the Z series and P series content. You know Z series had a really strong quarter I mean Z was up 17% mix were up 54% that’s the highest level of mix growth we’ve had in six years out of our mainframe business, so very strong performance and I say as we look at the fourth we should have another very strong quarter for our Z series content, now we would have an entire quarter of availability.
In addition we are going to announce the new system or systems of Z series get that gives you the ability to use mainframe governance and apply it to other technologies which will really position us for market leadership. So I think we’ve got a very exciting play on a Z series a basis and if you look at that to your later part of your question on a longest term kind of cycle they are really parts of the cycle on a Z series business the first four or five quarters are more structured around you know volume growth in base placement and then the ladder half of that cycle with micro code upgrades, less revenue but much higher profitability. So we should have to be able to exploit this over a longer period of time. We are quite excited about it I thought the results were really terrific.
You look at the P series business I mean lets got to the content that was announced in Power7 in January, that’s now been available for times we could build our place in the market place it was up 11% in the third quarter much like the second quarter mid range P was up 11% very strong performance there. 
If we look in the quarter about competitive displacements again we’re talking 250 customers, $225 million of business there so are continuing that strong position in the market. And as we now go into the fourth quarter with the full quarter of availability for the high end in the entry we should see an improvement in the overall growth rate for the total platform I mean you can expect that I think in the third quarter again we only had a couple of weeks of availability for both the high end and the entry.
So I think we’ve got a very strong position and I would not limit it just to our Z series and P series content, we had strong performance out of our storage base, it was up 8% within that disk was up 14, 15% in disk you know going forward we had third quarter real strength with XIV real strength with our DSA 1000 now going into fourth we’ll announce our new store wide 7000 mid range system with a lot of new content from our research division so we are quiet excited about that as well.

The next question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank you may ask your question.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank
It’s a follow-up on Katie’s question. What kind of software and services pull through do you anticipate with both the high-end p and the zSeries ramping simultaneously?
Mark Loughridge
Well if you look at the pull through, there is a relationship as you establish more platforms for the software business and in some respects there is some relationship directly going into the fourth because in the fourth quarter as we look at the pipeline that deals in opportunity we see an acceleration in our software business going into the fourth. So I think there is a relationship, it’s a longer term kind of a relationship, but we will start to see improvements in our software business coming out of the third quarter which I frankly felt was pretty good at 6%. We said it was going to be 6%.When we closed out the second quarter we came in right on target and I expect the fourth to be a pretty good acceleration of that base.
Operator
The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus
Mark due to the past few years, we've enjoyed visibility on margin expansion as a result of specifically identifying class actions and if that's an accurate statement the last major cost action I think was taken in the first quarter which we will anniversary early next year. Should we assume that the operating leverage and mix shift in addition to the day-to-day step you always do to take cost out will be the primary margin driver next year or is there more to think about and then also how should we think about levels of investment spending as the revenue growth accelerate?
Mark Loughridge
To answer your question I want to put it in context of the total model frame around the third quarter to better illustrate that. So if you look at the model, we were pretty clear I think at the Analyst Day that it’s going to be a combination of revenue performance, leverage from both mix and spend optimization as well as share repurchase and this quarter frankly on a revenue basis coming in at a 4% and remember that was impacted by about a point from PLM, I think we came pretty close to the model, right. I mean 4% one point impact PLM we had said, we were shooting at this at a more like a 5%, very close to the model.
On a leverage standpoint what we were counting on, on a kind of an annual base that would compound over the model period was really about 4/10th of a point at net income and so you look at this quarter, I mean we have got 7/10th of a point of leverage at PTI and 1.1 points at net. So if you want to compare either pretax or net for objective of 4/10th we did very, very well.
And of course we had a lot of momentum in our share repurchase well. So going forward we are very focused on long-term achievement of that 2015 model and that’s going to be a combination of ongoing attention to our revenue growth rate as the economies recover and we see the fruits of our labor to expand and GMU that was up 13% or in Business Analytics that was up double digit as well.
Ongoing focus on driving for that 4/10th or 5/10th of a point improvement in our leverage and as always we pay trading a value to our shareholders to ongoing share repurchase and dividends.
Operator
The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan
I wanted to follow-up on the commentary around the software acceleration. I heard the comments of the previous question as far as being related to the server platforms. But how should we think about just the inorganic piece? I mean, is that also a part of it, or are we just seeing the broader software cycle just starting up here post the hardware and the security installations we've seen across the IT land in the past three quarters or so?
Mark Loughridge
Well, my comments are really directed towards the confidence in my statement. Let me say it differently, it is really based on a pipeline of deals and the kind of characteristics of those deals that we see going in the fourth quarter. So we have a pretty darn good deal less as we do and that's going to drive both organic and inorganic performance in our software business. So as we look at it having recorded 6% in the second and 6% in the third, we think that should accelerate meaningfully as we go into the fourth quarter based on that pipeline of opportunities and the kind of progression of those deals and the characteristics of those deals.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
The next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Collins Stewart. You may ask your question.
Louis Miscioscia - Collins Stewart
When you look at the acquisitions that you've done, mostly obviously you've focused on the middleware and some other areas. Is that area starting to get a little bit less rich as you've got many companies Oracle, yourselves, ENT and so on trying there, and do you think that you all will switch your strategy and start to go more in the application area?
Mark Loughridge
Well, the last thing I'm going to do is tell my competition where we're going to start hunting, right. So, I think that would probably not be good judgment on my part. But I think your point really is, what do we see as the opportunity set across this for in an accelerated kind of a pace and I would make a couple of comments there: Number one, if you look at since 2000 I believe we’ve spent about $33 billion. So, if we annualize that say $3.3 billion. So, do we think in the next five years or 10 years there is not going to be $4 billion a year. I mean I find that hard to believe. Number two, we are hunting just to use that terminology in a lot of different spaces and we did have a number of acquisitions in the software business. But I’d remind you we’ve had some very powerful acquisition performance in our hardware business.
Now that performance if you look at the content we acquired, it really wasn’t left for property, but within the hardware content. So frankly XIV has turned it to be one of the best acquisitions we’ve done very, very strong performance on that low latency part of the market. De-duplication, that was a very strong place for us to acquire and they’ve had real synergies, not only within that business equation but for the rest of the organization. We now have broader plays cut across our segments that pull us into opportunities I think that have broader scope. And as always I remind of a point that we made at the Analyst Day. I mean intellectual property and the opportunity for acquisitions to have a meaningful impact on the business are not constrained to the borders of the US, right. This is a global opportunity set and the three acquisitions that we chose to highlight on Analyst Day, Cognos, ILOG, XIV, those are all acquisitions that we made outside the US borders. So I think it’s a pretty rich ongoing to save opportunities that as I said initially I think the last thing I'm going to do is start telling our competition where we're hunting.

The next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo
Hi, good afternoon. Actually I wanted to follow-up again on the outsource piece of the business and specifically was there any change above and beyond what you're expecting around contract duration or potential sizing of transaction, I mean other than obviously the volatilities on the one large deal?
Mark Loughridge
No, not really. Not that I would remark on, no, not really.
Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo
How do you think about then sort of next year this playing out. Are we going to speak on a continued sort of level trends around that duration that we've seen in the past couple of quarters?
Mark Loughridge
I got to say this is difficult to predict, its so deal dependant. You can see how much one deal can re-characterize a quarter and now we see big opportunities now in new growth markets and I don’t want to overemphasize it but we're quite excited about the new opportunity we see with Bharti in Africa. That does open up a new continent of opportunity for us. So, pretty deal dependent there and I really would not remark on significant changes driving different performances in the future.
Operator
The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal
Good afternoon. Mark I was hoping in the past couple of quarters you've given some quantitative direction to what you thought constant currency growth rate would be and so as we look at December versus the constant currency growth rate you did this quarter call it 4%, will the be up or down relative to that number? And I had a follow-up if I could.
Mark Loughridge
Well let's go through the revenue discussion first on the GTS business. The way I would look at it I think in the fourth quarter, we probably have a very similar rate of revenue growth that we had in the third. On GBS, I think will continue that ongoing higher way to growth that we saw in the third, looking at the deals they have, how they've lined up the resources, their investment in new resource to drive and continue growth and expansion in their organization. So I think they have a good platform for the fourth quarter and the growth rate should be again similar to what they saw in the third. 
On a hardware standpoint, again I think the hardware group did a great job; revenue up 11%. Now that’s the best growth rate we’ve had from SNTG in six years, and I think that should continue at a pretty high rate of growth.
So I think GTS, GBS, hardware going into the fourth will probably will have very similar growth rates we saw on the third. And I'd remind you on the GTS, that’s pretty big statement because the seasonally biggest quarter for our hardware is us. On the software growth however, I think that should accelerate as we go into fourth. And I think we should see some meaningful improvement in the growth rate, again based on the deals and the characteristics of the deals that we see in the fourth quarter.
Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal
Okay, helpful. If I could, on the follow-up Mark, the same type of question. Again, in the past you've given some direction on what you think bookings will be, up double digits, up in single digits, how are you thinking about bookings in the Q4 and if you want to just give us the context or including the large deal that crept over into Q4.
Mark Loughridge

As I looked at the bookings and kind of the momentum we see in bookings on the transactional content I do think we have some ongoing momentum there that’s going to be consistent as we exploited over the opportunity. It’s going to be dependent on the outsourcing business on ability to exploit these larger deals, they have some very good deals. So I am optimistic that we should see some good performance on our bookings as we go into fourth.
Patricia Murphy

Thank you Keith let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
At this time ma’am there are no further questions in queue.
Mark Loughridge
Okay, well let me just wrap up then and make a few comments. First of all we delivered another good quarter. We had revenue growth of 4% and as I said earlier when you adjust for the PLM divestiture, revenue growth was very close to our model. Looking ahead of the fourth quarter GTS revenue growth should be pretty consistent with the third, I think GBS will continue its strong performance somewhere to the third quarter.
With new product introductions and STG in mainframe with our new systems and our ongoing mainframe announcement, three quarters of opportunity across P series, new announcements in our server product line we are going to have another good hardware quarter in the fourth as well. 
And in software based on our pipeline of deals we should see improvements in the revenue of growth rate and therefore so overall constant currency revenue growth should be pretty somewhere the quarter’s strong performance with software providing some more opportunity.
On a margin basis I would have to say, we are above the model level. The model was about four tenths, five tenths of a point per quarter on a net basis and we exceeded that on a pretax basis up 7/10ths and certainly on a net basis of 1.1 points. We are leveraging, our profit and cash delivering good shareholder returns and investing for the future and with all that we delivered EPS of $2.82 up 18%, that’s on top of 18% growth last year. So we are increasing our full year EPS to at least 1140 and I would remind you that’s an at least so over there the last four years, whether you look at the third quarter or the full year we’ve almost doubled our earnings per share since we introduced the 2010 road map. So thanks very much for joining us today and now as always back to work.

Mark Loughridge

Thank you for joining us today. This quarter we continued the trend of improving business performance; increasing constant currency revenue growth, expanding margin, and once again, delivering double-digit earnings per share growth.
We’ve now grown EPS in each of the last 30 quarters. And since the beginning of our 2010 roadmap, we’ve grown EPS at a double-digit rate in 12 of the last 14 quarters. 
Our revenue growth of 2% was two points better than our constant currency performance in the first quarter, and seven points better than our fourth quarter growth rate. 
Our revenue growth would have been about a point higher, adjusting for the divested PLM business. So on this basis, the improvement was broad based across all segments and all geographies, including Europe. 
Our performance is driven by the investments we’ve been making to capture growth opportunities and to deliver value to our clients. We’ve been investing heavily to build out the infrastructures in the emerging countries. 
This quarter, our growth markets were up 14%, or 9% of constant currency; led by the BRIC countries which were up 16% of constant currency. Our performance in the growth markets has consistently outpaced the major markets. 
And as a result, for the first half of this year, our business in the growth markets is now as large as our Euro-Zone business for the first time. 
We’ve been investing to extend our technology leadership. Earlier this year we introduced Power7 technology to our Midrange unit servers. And this quarter, the Midrange grew 11%, which resulted in four-points-a-share gain in Power Systems. 
In the third quarter, we’ll have Power7 across our entire UNIX product line. And we’ll introduce and ship our next generation mainframe solution. We have been investing in key growth areas such as Business Analytics. Our Business Analytics revenue was up 14%, which contributed to the strong performance of both Software and Global Business services. 
Global Business Services revenue growth improved to 3%, and Software Key-Branded Middleware was up 10% at constant currency. And we took share again, this quarter in Software. 
We’ve been investing in acquisitions to build our skills and technology in support of our growth initiatives. In the first half, we have closed six acquisitions and announced another three, for a total of about $3 billion. 
These acquisitions add to our capabilities in areas such as Industry Solutions for Smarter Planet Initiatives, and Business Analytics and Cloud Computing. 
In this quarter, we also continued to improve our profit profile, expanding pre-tax margin by a point, and growing earnings per share by 13% to $2.61. 
And remember, we’ve delivered this profit performance compared to a strong second quarter of 2009, where we expanded pre-tax margin by over four points, and grew EPS by 18 percent. 
So now based on our first-half performance and our view of the second half, we’re increasing our expectations for the full year of 2010 to at least $11.25 of earnings per share. That’s up from our view in April, and up $0.25 from January. 
Now, let’s turn to the financial results for the quarter with a quick walk down the P&L.
We delivered $23.7 billion of revenue. That’s up 2% as reported in a constant currency. We completed the sale of the Software PLM operations at the end of the first quarter. This divestiture impacted IBM’s revenue growth by about a point, and our Software growth by about four points. 
This quarter we dealt with a sharp strengthening of the Dollar versus the Euro. Currency provided 40 basis points of revenue growth as compared to the 200-to-300 basis points projected based on mid-April spot rates. So that’s a two-to-three point impact to our revenue growth. 
So the currency movement since April impacted second-quarter revenue by about $500 million. And if you consider the currency movements since mid-January, second-quarter revenue was impacted by $1 billion. 
We expanded gross margin, driven by better margins in Global Business Services and Software. Our expense was down 1% year to year. Our Operational Expense Performance was five points better, mitigated by impacts from currency and acquisitions. 
We increased pre-tax income by 7%, and pre-tax margin was up a point, to 19.3%. Our tax rate was down just over a point, year to year, to 26%; in line with first quarter and our expected range for the full year. Net income improved 9% and margin expanded nearly a point to 20.3% [ph]. And finally, our ongoing Share repurchase Activity drove a 3% reduction in our share count. 
So bottom line, we delivered $2.61 of earnings per share, up 13% from a year ago. 
And while it’s certainly more difficult to measure the currency contribution to the bottom line due to the impact of pricing and sourcing actions, we estimate that currency, including hedging activity, impacted earnings growth by $0.10 or $0.11 per share. 
So it’s important to note that we’re achieving this 13% growth off of strong profit performance in second quarter 2009, and in the face of a significant currency headwind. I’ll address that in more detail in a few minutes.
Now, I’ll turn to the revenue details, starting with the geographic view. 
In discussing the geo results, as always, I’ll focus my comments on constant currency. After substantial improvement in the year-to-year growth rates from fourth quarter to first, we again had an improving trend in year-to-year revenue growth from the first to the second quarter across our geographies; with the Americas and Asia Pacific, each better by two points, and Europe better by a point. 
The major markets also improved a point, with the best growth, again, coming from the UK, which was up a very strong 11%. And the US returned to growth for the first time in seven quarters. 
Our growth markets grew 9%, outpacing the majors by nine points. In the BRIC countries, which represent over 1/3 of the growth markets, revenue grew 16% with double-digit growth in each of the four countries. 
Our strong performance extended beyond the BRICs. In fact, we had double-digit growth in over 35 countries this quarter, up from 30 in the first quarter. Our ongoing investments have positioned us to capture the fast-growing opportunity in these markets. And we’ve been rapidly expanding our base of business. 
As I mentioned earlier, our Growth Markets Business is now as large as our Euro-Zone Business. And at this pace, we expect our growth markets to be larger by the end of the year. 
Turning to Revenue by Segment, our Services Business returned to revenue growth at constant currency, led by an eight-point improvement in Global Business Services growth rate compared to the first quarter. 
Our Software performance was excellent, with Key-Branded Middleware up 10% at constant currency, and total Software up 6%, excluding the divested PLM Business.
We’re capturing growth in key areas like business analytics, storage management, and business integration. 
This quarter our Systems and Technology Business delivered mid-single-digit growth, as expected. And we gained or held share in every brand. So on this basis, similar to the Geo performance; we had improvement versus the first-quarter growth rate in all segments at constant currency. 
Turning to expense, our total expense and other income was down 1%. With a 2% increase in revenue, our expense-to-revenue ratio improved 9/10 of a point year to year. The expense decline was driven by operational expense improvements of five points year to-year. But this improvement was mitigated by currency, which impacted expense growth by two points, and acquisitions for another two points. 
We’ve had an ongoing focus on increasing efficiency and driving productivity across enterprise. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of operational expense improvement. 
Some of the savings from our productivity initiative goes to the bottom line, and some is reinvested back into the business. 
As an example this quarter, while overall SG&A was down 4%, excluding currency and acquisitions, SG&A in the growth markets was up 10%. This is consistent with our investment profile over the last two years, where our operational SG&A spend for the growth markets was ten-or-more points higher than the majors. 
I want to mentioned just a couple of items that had significant year-to-year impact to our profit this quarter. This quarter, our workforce for balancing charges were less than $20 million, down about $50 million for the second quarter of last year. 
When you look at the year-to-year benefit in Other Income and Expense, remember that last year we had a charge of almost $120 million related to investment in a joint venture. Other Income contains a significant portion of the impact from our Hedge of Cash Flow Programs. 
As you now, we hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global-cash planning. 
While our hedging programs generated a gain this quarter, it wasn’t as large as the gain last year. The result is a year-to-year impact of profit of over $130 million, which is roughly 70% in Expense and 30% in Cost of Good Sold. 
This $130 million hedging impact is about $0.07 per share year to year. We also estimate that we had a translation impact to our earnings growth of about $0.03. So the total impact of the bottom line from currency is estimated at $0.10 or $0.11 overall. 
So now let’s turn to our Segment Pre-Tax Margins. 
Our improving-business mix and productivity initiatives have yielded consistent improvement in our margin overtime. 
This quarter, Software and Global Business Services had great margin performance; each up over a point. Our Systems and Technology Margins declined due to mix of business and a higher level of investment to support our new product introductions this year. 
Now, let’s turn to the segments, starting with Services. 
The two services segments return to growth at constant currency this quarter, delivering 13.7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-to-year as reported, and up 1% at constant currency. 
This revenue performance was largely driven by Global Business Services, which improved its year-to-year growth rate by eight points sequentially. Total signings were flat sequentially at 12.3 billion, down 12% year-to-year, with Global Business Services signings up 2% at constant currency. Backlog remains steady at 129 billion, up $1 billion adjusted for currency. 
The biggest drive of the signing’s decline was outsourcing; down 19%. Based on an assessment of our large outsourcing contracts, we had a significant decline in contract extensions as a number of large deals rolled out of the quarter. 
Contract extensions have little-to-no benefit to near-term revenue. In contrast, we had good growth in new business signings, which have a more immediate contribution to revenue. When you look at the revenue that will be generated from these outsourcing signings, we will actually get more revenue over the next 12 months from this quarter’s outsourcing signings of $6.5 billion then we did from last year’s second quarter signings of $8 billion.
So the strength of new business signings and outsourcing contributes to an improving revenue trend for the rest of the year, and shows why it’s important not to put too much emphasis on just the absolute signings number. 
Moving to Transactional Signings, which include Integrated Technology Services, Consulting, and AMS Systems Integration, signings were down 3%. Again, an improvement from first quarter at constant currency. 
You can see improving performance in transactional signings over the past several quarters in our supplemental charts. It shows a positive trend and good momentum as we move into the third quarter. 
This quarter, ITS growth improved from first-quarter rates to constant currency, and AMS grew. In Consulting, signings were up 17% in North America and up in total for the first half, although total Consulting was down in the quarter as a number of deals rolled out of the quarter. 
Overall, we signed 15 deals greater than $100 million. And as I said, total services backlog at the end of the quarter was $129 billion, up $1 billion adjusting for currency, though down $2 billion at actual rates. And we had another quarter with very low backlog erosion. 
Now, I’ll go to the Key Drivers of Performance in the two services segments. 
In Global Technology Services, revenue was $9.2 billion, up 1% year to year as reported, and flat at constant currency. GTS Outsourcing revenue was up 2% in the quarter and Integrated Technology Services revenue was down 2%. 
We had good performance in the growth markets with revenue up over 8% at constant currency in each of these businesses. 
Global Technology Services pre-tax income was up slightly in the quarter with margin at 14.9%. 
With the benefit of the first quarter rebalancing activity coming in the second half of the year, and an improved revenue growth trend, we expect to expand margin in the second half. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was up 3% both as reported and at constant currency. We saw an improved performance in many areas of the business as we grew revenue in both the major markets and the growth markets in all sectors with the exception of Communications sector. And in both consulting and AMS, where we had particular strength in North America with combined revenue up 8% at constant currency. 
From an offering perspective, we had double-digit growth in both Business Analytics and Smarter Planet.
Global Business Services pre-tax profit was up 12% year to year with margin expanding 1.3 points to 14.6%. This expansion was driven by higher utilization and benefits from the continued implementation of our globally integrated capabilities. At the same time, we were continuing to add to our skill base and invest for further growth. 
To wrap up services, we saw a number of positive signs in improving trends in the quarter. We had improvement in the revenue growth rate sequentially, with a return to growth at constant currency for Total Services. GBS revenue was up 3% with eight points of improvement in the growth rate. We had good recovery in AMS. We had very good new-customer signings in Outsourcing. Backlog was up $1 billion year-to-year with a low level of erosion. And we have a good pipeline of deals going into third quarter. 
With this level of performance, the Total Services Revenue Growth Rate should improve in the second half. This improvement will be led by GBS with its higher transactional content. And with the benefits of the first quarter resource for balancing, we expect to see margin expansion in the second half as well. 
Software had another strong quarter of revenue performance with revenue of $5.3 billion. That’s up 2% year to year, or 6% adjusting for the divestiture of PLM, which is a more appropriate view of our ongoing business. 
Key Branded Middleware grew 9% at actual rates and 10% at constant currency, and gained share for the 11th-straight quarter as we continued to solidify our lead in the Middleware Market. The Share Gain was broad based across WebSphere, Information Management, Tivoli and Rational. Key Branded Middleware accounted for 62% of our total software revenue, up four points from this time last year. Both the WebSphere and Tivoli brands grew at double digits year to year, and we had strong performance in the Business Analytics product set. 
Segment pre-tax income was $2 billion, up 7% year to year, and pre-tax margin improved 1.3 points to 33%. 
This is the 11th consecutive quarter of margin expansion in the Software Segment. 
Now, let me take you through the brands. WebSphere had another excellent quarter, growing 17%, and gained share in all segments with strong performance across the portfolio. Application Servers, which provide customers with secure and resilient infrastructure for mission-critical business applications grew 32%. 
Business Integrations Software, which includes our ILOG and Lombardi acquisitions, grew 12%. Information Management also had a strong quarter, growing 7%. Information Management Software offerings provide the foundation for IBM’s business analytics and optimization offerings. 
Tivoli had another terrific quarter in all three market segments, and grew 18% in total. Enterprise Asset Management, within the Systems Management portfolio grew double-digits. This continues to be a critical component of IBMs Smarter Planet Solutions. 
In Security Software we had strength across the portfolio and in all geographies. Our Tivoli Storage products also continued to perform very well, growing double digits and gaining share. 
As an example, XIV Software, which provides ease of use and lower total cost of ownership, more than doubled. And Tivoli Storage Manager grew 10% this quarter, driven by its market-leading data reduction capabilities and related cost benefits. 
The breadth and diversity of our Software portfolio combined with strategic investments in high-growth areas have enabled us to achieve consistently strong results in the software segment. We expect to deliver similar levels of revenue performance in the third quarter. 
Systems and Technology revenue was $4 billion, up 3% year to year or 4% at constant currency. Revenue was driven by continued growth in System x, storage, retail stores and microelectronics.
We had strong performance in the growth markets. BRIC countries grew 20% year to year with growth in all brands, and we expect the strength in growth markets to continue in the second half. Gross profit margin was down one point driven by mix. 
In the third quarter, we will announce new high-end servers. Both the System z and high-end power servers will be refreshed with availability in the middle of September.
Now, let me take you through more detail on the brands. Power Systems Revenue declined 10% year to year. Our new Power7 products drove mid-range growth of 11% and Power Blades growth up over 65%. This performance drives our ninth consecutive quarter of share gains. 
In the second quarter, we had 225 competitive units displacements, of which almost 2/3s were from Sun. This resulted in $225 million of business and nearly four points of share gain. This is a sequential increase of over $75 million from the first quarter where we gained over seven points of share. We have now won 620 deals from Sun, totaling nearly $650 million over the last six quarters. 
The win rate has been increasing and we expect these takeouts to continue throughout the second half. This quarter we will announce our Power7 entry in high-end systems with availability in September. 
Our high-end systems will scale up to 256 cores, and are capable of running 1,000 virtual images, which is four times more than our current high-end Power6 processors. 
Additionally, the energy efficiency of these new high-end systems will be five-to-seven times more efficient than the latest Unix Systems from both Sun and Hewlett Packard. 
Storage revenue grew 5% year to year. Disk revenue grew 12% or 14% of constant currency driven by continued strength and high-end offerings; XIV and DS8000. 
XIV added more than 130 new customers to the platform in the second quarter, and revenue more than doubled year to year. 
System x revenue grew 30% year to year, led by our high-volume offerings in our System x Blades. X Blades grew 16% year to year. The high-end of System x was up 17% and gained share. This high-end performance combined with the growth in blades and improvements in end-to-end operational efficiencies contributed to improve gross profit margin performance in System x. 
System z revenue declined 24% year to year. This week IBM will announce the next generation of System z; the fastest and most-scalable enterprise server in the industry. This server provides 40% more performance on a mix of workloads than the equivalent Z10. Some workloads can achieve greater performance improvements, such as Linux, which has 60% better performance and 35% lower costs.
This announcement is the foundation for IBM’s first system of systems, which provides the capability to manage ten times the virtual machines of the M-ware by extending mainframe governance to our other industry-leading technologies. 
Microelectronics OEM revenue is up 23% year to year. Both our 300 millimeter and 200 millimeter fabs are fully utilized. 
Systems and Technology continued its revenue growth this quarter with strong performance in Disk Storage, System x, Microelectronics, and Retail Store Solutions. And with the introduction of new high-end systems in third quarter, I expect this growth rate to improve in the third and fourth quarters and to deliver double-digit PTI growth for the second half of the year. 
Turning to Cash Flow, we generated $3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which was down $400 million year to year, driven by higher-capital investments of $100 million in support of hardware product announcements as well as a prior year foreign-tax refund of $360 million. 
In the first half, our pre-cash flow of $4.4 billion was flat year to year. We had strong operating performance driven by higher net income of $600 million and sales-cycle working capital improvements of $350 million year to year.
This was offset by higher-capital investments for new hardware products and semiconductor technology. And a year-to-year impact of over $700 million for unique one-time tax refunds as previously disclosed. Excluding these unique tax refunds, free cash flow would have been up $700 million. 
Looking at the uses of cash in the first half, we spent $1 billion for six acquisitions in support of our growth strategy. The largest of these were National Interest Security, Initiate Systems, Lombardi, and Cast Iron Systems.
In addition, we’ve returned almost $10 billion to the shareholders in the first half; $8.1 billion dollars was in the form of Share Repurchases, and we have about $6 billion remaining from our last board authorization.
We took our dividend up 18% in April and paid out $1.6 billion in dividends. This is the 15th consecutive year that we raised our dividend and we’ve more than tripled our dividend over the last five years. 
Now, let’s turn to the Balance Sheet where we see the impact of our cash performance.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.2 billion. More than 2/3 of which was in the US. Our collections remain strong. 
Total debt was $26.7 billion dollars. $21 billion of debt was in support of our financing business, which has leveraged at 7.1-to-1. $5.5 billion dollars was non-financing debt that was down from $6.6 billion a year ago. 
Non-financing debt-to-cap was 23%, up from 16% in December and down from 35% a year ago. With this level of leverage, we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility. The balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term. 
I’ll start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our Earnings-Per-Share Performance.
This quarter, all categories positively contributed to our earnings growth. Our Revenue Growth at constant mix and margin contributed a nickel. The largest contributor was Operating Leverage, driven by gross-margin expansion, improving expense productivity, and a year-to-year improvement in the tax rate. And a 3% reduction in share count contributed $0.08. 
So once again, our growth was delivered through a combination of revenue growth, margin expansion, and an effective use of cash. And lastly, uniquely identified in the Bridge, we overcame a currency headwind of $0.10 to $0.11 on our way to 13% earnings-per-share growth. 
Now, for the last several years, we have consistently delivered strong earnings growth. Since early 2007, when we first introduced our 2010 roadmap we’ve delivered double-digit EPS growth each year, and in 12 of the last 14 quarters. Compared to the DOW, IBM is the only company to have positive year-to-year growth in each of the last 14 quarters. 
In each of these periods, which span a variety of economic environments, we faced unique opportunities and challenges. There are many dimensions of IBMs business model, from business mix to global scale and structure, to financial strength and flexibility that have allows us to overcome challenges and capitalize in opportunities while we consistently deliver. 
This quarter we dealt with a significant currency headwind caused by the sharp strengthening of the dollar and still delivered 13% earnings-per-share growth against a very strong second quarter of last year, which had 18% EPS growth. 
So while some companies will show growth this quarter as they recover from losses in the recession, IBM is building on our strong performance over the last eight years. We continued our steady improvement in the business in both revenue growth and margin expansion. And we used our strong profit and cash position to invest and expand our base of opportunity while returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share buy-back. 
Looking forward to the second half, we’ll have exciting new product introductions with our new mainframe system of systems, and Power7 technology across our Power Systems product line. We’ll continue to leverage investments in our growth initiatives; Smarter Plant, Business Analytics, and Growth Markets. We’ll integrate the acquisition announced with quarter. We’ll yield the benefit from our first-quarter workforce rebalancing actions. And we’ll continue to drive efficiencies and increase productivity, all while continuing to invest in innovation throughout the business. 
All of this supports our expectation of at least $11.25 of earnings per share of the year. 
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that compliment our prepared remarks. And second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. 
When we conclude the Q&A, I’ll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. Operator, please open it up for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
Thank you. At this time, we’d like to being the Question-and-Answer Session of today’s conference. (Operator instructions). 
The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi, with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question. 

Toni Sacconaghi – Sanford C. Bernstein

Yes, thank you. Mark, you went through each of the businesses in terms of your outlook for the remainder of the year. On Software you said to expect a similar kind of growth rate to continue. For hardware you stated that it should improve. And for services you stated it should improve as well. Can you clarify that those are constant currency statements? And given the currency outlook, at current spot rates, is it realistic to believe that either Q3 or Q4, IBM could grow its revenues above the 2% rate year over year that it did this quarter? 
Mark Loughridge
The statements that I made, Toni, where in fact constant currency statements. I mean, we look at the impact of currency and gives some analysis on that in the supporting charts, but it’s very difficult to look at how that’s going to effect it given the volatility in current periods. 
I mean, as an example, just look at how much currency moved in the last week and a half. I mean, frankly, we were revising this supplemental chart on a daily basis because the change was so significant. So at least from my perspective, Toni, the important part from the IBM Team as the – in an operational mode, is to be able to build a fundamental business model and capability to deal with that fluctuation in currency. 
And so if you look at it, at today’s spot rates, we would look forward on an EPS basis and project about the same level of currency impact in the second half that we had in the first half. And we were certainly able to deal with that in the first have and I would expect we would be able to do deal with that in the second half. And I think you can kind of make that same statement if you look over longer periods of time. We’ve certainly been in periods where currency has gone against us, and with us, and in those – each of those quarters in the last four or five years, we have grown EPS. 
So from my perspective, the statements we made looking at individual businesses on a constant currency basis, I look at our capability to deal with fluctuation currencies in the first half, and we should be able to do the same in the second half. And on an earnings-per-share basis at current spot rates, we would look at that earnings-per-share impact in the second half being about the same magnitude as the first half. 
Toni Sacconaghi – Sanford C. Bernstein

Mark, just to clarify, so you’ve done the exercise for what you think earnings impact – earnings will look like given a prevailing spot rate. My question is, have you done the exercise for what revenue looks like in trying to balance your commentary about improving fundamentals in two of your three businesses. Do you think the reported revenue growth rate at the spot rates can actually improve in the second half, or is that unrealistic? 
Mark Loughridge

Well, let’s look at the third quarter. I mean, in the third quarter, on current basis, we look at revenue going against us by about a point. And if we get the acceleration of revenue that we’re looking for from Services Business now with better momentum and on better trajectory, Software repeating the kind of quarter that they had, and now the new-announcement content, I mean, I will look at that third quarter and I would say, yes, we should be generating positive revenue growth even in the face of that currency fluctuation. 
Patricia Murphy

Okay, thanks, Toni. Let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question. 
Keith Bachman – BMO Capital Markets
Hi, Mark. I wanted to ask you about services if I could. You indicated that the backlog, or signings, excuse me, was down because of extensions didn’t come in, renewals. Is that an anomaly, or a trend? And how should investors be thinking about signings as we look out, certainly, this quarter, but indeed for the second half of the year? 
Mark Loughridge
Yeah, let’s step back. On the signings basis as we analyzed it, you know, we had – on the – in the GBS Business we had good revenue growth, we had positive signings performance. So then when you look at Global Technology Services, the issue that we wrestled with was really in our outsourcing business.
Keith Bachman – BMO Capital Markets

Right. 
Mark Loughridge

And the point I was making on the outsourcing business is that if you look at kind of the completion of those signings, by analyzing the larger deals, we actually did very well on a year-to-year basis on the new-business signing. And it was not only a year-to-year basis, but it was also quarter-to-quarter. So if you look at deals greater than $50 million in outsourcing, that new-business content was up 33% year to year, it was up 36% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. That frankly, generates better near-term characteristics than we see in extensions, obviously. And it gives us confidence as you look at the second-half billions in outsourcing this quarter, we’ll frankly get much better characteristics on a revenue side from those signings than we did last year at $8 billion. 
Now, two your point about the trend laying on this and the characteristics, as we looked at the analysis, frankly, we believe that last year we had a high level of extensions because our customer base was wrestling with the economic difficulty of the recession and there were a lot of contract renegotiations. And in part of those contract renegotiations we saw a number of extensions. But I think, frankly, as we’ve worked with the operational team, we believe the bulk of that trend is in the rearview mirror. And I do think it’s quite reasonable to be encouraged by the strong growth rate that we did have in a new-business content. And that’s what really led us to project on a forward-looking basis that we ought to have improving revenue characteristics even as we move into the third quarter in GTS as well as GBS. 
Patricia Murphy

Thank you, Keith. Could we go to the next question, please? 
Operator

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes, with Barclays Capital. You may ask your question. 
Ben Reitzes – Barclays Capital 
Yeah, thanks a lot. Mark, can you comment on how trends are going in the public sector vertical for you? There’s obviously concerns out there on the State, and Local level, on the Federal level, and then on the European-public level. And then comment on Europe as well. So what you saw there, and if any of those verticals impacted the signings as well. So revenues, and signings, and those in the European market as well as the public vertical; if you have any comments on how things are going in those. Thanks.
Mark Loughridge

Sure, let me start with public sector. I mean in public-sector basis, if you look at the US Federal performance, we did pretty well. You know, revenue was up about 5%. So if you look as you kind of mentioned in your remarks, Ben, it was really – State and Local was more challenging. And as you look at it, I think it’s more indicative of the State and Local Governments wrestling with tough local budgets.
When you then say, well, how did we perform on a growth market basis? Like the US, state, and local, I mean Australia was down, but we had a number of very strong performances in public sector in our growth market. So as an example, ASEAN was up 11%, India was up 14%. China was up 16%. Korea was up 10%. Latin America was up a whopping 77%. 
So I did see public-sector challenges in state and local in North America. I think US Federal did pretty well, up 5%. And we had a number of very strong performances in public sector in our growth-markets unit. 
Now, turning to your second question, on Europe in general, really Europe had pretty good performance if you look at that growth rate compared to first quarter. That was in fact an acceleration. And they were more affected than North America by the PLM divestiture to Dassault. So frankly were it not for that, they would have been flat. 
I do think however, it’s interesting when you look at the characteristics and the overview of our business, that this is the first quarter where our growth-markets unit has equaled in size the content that we have in the Euro-Zone. So that will obviously be an ongoing trend. We’ve had our growth-markets growth rate exceeding that in major markets now for, I think it’s ten quarters in a row. And generally, it’s in that magnitude of about eight points. Interesting, this quarter, it’s in fact ten points. 
But we saw improvement in year-to-year growth rate across the board even in Europe. We did well. Some counties in Europe, you look at the UK, we’re up 11%. Last quarter, UK was up 8%, and the fourth they were up 4%. So it does vary quite a bit by individual country.
Patricia Murphy

Thanks, Ben. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator

The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Caris & Company. You may ask your question.
Robert Cihra – Caris & Company

Hi. Thank you very much. Can you give us any idea you think with the Power7 and the – I’m sorry, the Power Series I guess, and the mainframe declines in the quarter. I mean, do you think that’s all hesitation ahead of the new Q3 products. And maybe if you even try to attempt to get an idea what those markets look like had you not had a big refresh come in? How do those markets feel relative to what obvious strength we’re seeing in X86? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge

Yeah. I mean, I think what you saw in the quarter is a function of the anticipation of the new announcement content we have coming out in the third quarter. And by the way, these are very strong announcement. I mean, the Z series, this is a major new announcement. It’s not just a new Z, it’s now Z and a system of systems implementation. And we’ll be able to tell you much more about that during the announcement later this week.
On the power side, we’re now announcing the high-end of power as well as the entry-power content. 
If you want to look at how power is performing, let’s look at the content in the mid-range where did have the power announcement. The new Power7 technology and that mid-range system grew 11%. And if you look at the Blades content that Power7 technology was on, it was up 67%. So you snap out those elements with the new announcement, we did very well.
We’re still taking strong market share in this platform. You saw – I would imagine, the first quarter took seven and a half points this year, and the second quarter, four points this year. Now moving into a third quarter, where by the end of the quarter, we’re going to have Power7 technology across the board, coupled with the fact that we’ll have the new Z Series announcement. I think we should have a very strong quarter as we move into the third.
Patricia Murphy

Thank you, Rob. Let’s go to the next question, please.
Operator

The next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup. You may ask your question.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup

Okay, thank you. Mark, I just wanted to clarify your comments around the mix of outsourcing renewals versus new business. Is the takeaway there that some renewal business was actually pulled into 2009 as customers sought to renegotiate contracts and get better pricing? And therefore the renewal business is a little weaker than most investors and industry sources thought for this year? And then if you could also perhaps give us your view of the pipeline for the rest of the year and maybe some sense of what you think the growth rate will be for signings this year. And how that’s different from the revenue growth rate you expect given this mix of renewals versus new business.
Mark Loughridge

Sure. Let’s look at outsourcing specifically where I made those comments. First of all, if you look at the progression through the quarter, Richard, we had double-digit signage growth for our services right through week ten of the quarter. And what we saw is we had a number of contracts roll into the third quarter. So as I look at the outsourcing business on forward-looking basis on the third quarter, we should have pretty strong double-digit growth in our outsourcing business going into the third.
Again, I think the impressive part on the new business was the growth rate, not just year-to-year, but also quarter-to-quarter where it was up 36% now generating more impressive revenue implications as we go into the third quarter. 
But overall, on a forward-looking basis, we did have a number of contracts roll from second quarter into third quarter. We’re generally on a trend line for double-digit signage growth through week ten. And now given that, as we look forward to the third quarter, that outsourcing business should have a good double-digit growth rate in signings for the third.
Patricia Murphy

Thank you, Richard. Can we take the next question, please?

The next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katie Huberty – Morgan Stanley

Thanks. Good afternoon. Mark, I just want to go back to Europe. Clearly, the year-on-year revenue-growth trend improved. But if you look at linearity through the quarter and the pipeline going into the back half, is this fair to expect that the growth rate in Europe continues to improve in the next couple of quarters, or should we expect that to flatten out conservatively?
Mark Loughridge

Well, again, you know, I’m looking at the implications of what I see in the business as we’ve gone through the first half of the year. And in the first half of the year, certainly Europe was wrestling with those individual economic challenges. It’s not like they just occurred at the end of the quarter. And we had overall kind of steadily-improving performance in our European business. And as I said, we had some very strong performances, like the UK. I mean, Katie, you know, you look at a country like the UK growing 11% a quarter, that’s pretty powerful.
And you could pick even Greece and Spain, they were relatively flat, even amongst the turmoil that they had. So from my perspective, as I look at the data, I do think we should expect that Europe should have an improving trend as we go into the third quarter. 
And overall for the IBM Corporation, it should see the same.
Patricia Murphy

Thanks Katie. Let’s go to the next question.
Operator

The next question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.
Chris Whitmore – Deutsche Bank

Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on those last two questions around linearity in the quarter, particularly as it relates to bookings trend. It sounds like outsourcing bookings slowed. And I believe previously you said you saw some deal slippage in the consulting business outside of the US. So maybe hoping to get some more color on kind of the global-IT demand as you see it, and whether or not customers are delaying or deferring signing large contracts to wait to see how this European situation shakes out. Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge

I would not jump to that conclusion off my comments. And the reason I say that, remember we’re talking about contract extensions. Those could be driven by a number of different things. 
First of all, I’ve already said that we think it was a high-level extension of last year due to the economic environment. 
Secondly, they can be influenced just by contract dates and windows-contract dates. So we had a number of those extensions roll to the third quarter. But as I said, as you look at that outsourcing performance, moving into the third quarter, we expect that to have double-digit growth rate. And that’s pretty strong.
Additionally, I would say within the quarter, we saw that new business content with very strong growth on a year-to-year basis and a quarter-to-quarter basis.
Additionally, we had a very strong close with our software business. The software had a very, very powerful third month of the quarter. So overall, revenue trends in the quarter were very measured and steady throughout the quarter. So I do not think I would take this and interpret a reflection that there is a pull back in spending. 
I think my remarks are, in a way, indicating the reverse in that we think that rollover deals should accelerate performance in the outsource and signings content in the third quarter. And we should see measured improvement once again in revenue performance for services and the IBM Corporation as we go from second to third.
Patricia Murphy

Thank you, Chris. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator.

The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JP Morgan. You may ask your question.
Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan

Thank you. Good afternoon. Mark, can we shift gears to growth margins? How should we think about some of these puts and takes here in terms of some of these services extensions maybe not being renewed. I know they can be higher value. And also we have the refreshers here with the power in the mainframe. Will there be any sort of margin impact, either good or maybe some head winds temporary on the hardware perspective in 3Q versus 4Q?
Mark Loughridge

Sure. Well, let’s take those in separate parts. First of all let’s look at margin. For the IBM Corporation as a whole, when we have taken you through our business model and the – either the roadmap to 2010, or to 2015, we’re looking for productivity on PTI margin and the model is about 4/10s to 5/10s of a point. As we look at that PTI margin improvement, it was a point. So I would look at it and say, pretty good performance.
If you look at the gross margin, it was up 1/10th of a point. And remember, within that 1/10th of a point, it was absorbing some of the impact of currency in the hedge that is within the cost element. 
So I think margin did a pretty good job. I think our productivity actions did a good job. And frankly, if you just took a real steely-eyed view of that, you’re improvement in our productivity versus the model. You’d have to say that it was about two times the model. 
Now, the other point that you had asked about is on a service base. So if you look at services, again, at the PTI margin base, overall services had an improvement of about 4/10ths of a point. Again, I would say that’s very close to model. I mean, 4/10ths of a point within a quarter in the services business, that in and of itself is absorbing some of the impact of currency in a hedge. Outside of currency in the hedge, that margin would have been up about 8/10ths of a point. 
So once again, I look at that content, I think the performance was pretty positive. And then your last question, as we go into the third quarter, the product announcements that we have in high-end P and our Z-series content are high-margin end of the product line. So they are absolutely going to drive stronger hardware margins in the third quarter. And frankly, you’re going to see that on a forward-looking basis because we should have very strong double-digit PTI growth rates in our hardware business in the third quarter as we announce these newer, high-margin platforms in both the Power Series as well as our Z-Series mainframe. 
Patricia Murphy

Thank you, Mark. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from Maynard Um, with UBS. You may ask your question. 
Maynard Um – UBS 

Hi. Thanks. I just want to dive a little deeper into the public business. The weakness in the State and Local, I think makes sense. But from a Federal level, I think that was more backward looking. If you look at the US Government and the OMB recently put a halt on government contracts that are kind of behind the US, it doesn’t sound like you’re expecting any impact in your outlook from that. But I’m just curious how we should look at that, and whether that’s embedded into your outlook. 
Mark Loughridge

Well, I think – I think on that public sector statement, on the US Government statements that you’re referencing, we’ve got to see how this plays out. Let me tell you what I have heard. I think what they have said is that they’re reassessing kind of the mix of their spend, not necessarily a reduction of the spend, but a mix of their spend towards projects that are yielding the best productivity and yield against their business cases in their platform. And I think that sounds like a very logical thing for them to do. As we look at it, and we look at our contracts, we think we have very strong contracts. We think they’re performing well. So on that kind of a base, I would not project a big impact, but I’ve got to wait and we’ve got to see how this rolls out. But that’s how I have heard it described. 

Maynard Um – UBS 

Okay. And that cautiousness is embedded into your outlook for the growth into the back half?
Mark Loughridge
Yes. 
Maynard Um – UBS 
Okay, great. Thank you. 
Patricia Murphy

Thank you, Maynard. Operator, let’s take one last question, please. 
Operator

Thank you. The last question comes from David Grossman with Thomas Weisel Partners. You may ask your question. 
David Grossman – Thomas Weisel Partners
Thanks very much. You know, Mark, I know there’s been a lot of questions on the bookings, and I think I understand the outsourcing phenomenon, but on the transactional side of the business, you know, bookings have remained negative, I think which were negative last year on a constant currency basis, although they’re improving. Yet the GBS revenue growth has turned positive. So again, it seems there’s a little bit of disconnect between what’s happening in the bookings and what’s happening in terms of revenue growth. Can you, you know, help us understand and reconcile, you know, what’s going on now in the short-term side of the business that may be leading to that? 
Mark Loughridge

Well, you know, first of all we had shorter durations on some of the contracts. Second of all, we had a very positive consulting performance in the first quarter. Third, you know, you look at this quarter, our North America Consulting Business did a very good job, signings were up 17%. And I think lastly on that point, that’s why we included that supplemental chart. You could see, you know, just draw that trend line yourself into the third quarter, measured performance increasing every quarter as we go into the second half, and now against an easier set to compare. So I feel quite confident that we’re going to have good transactional performance on that base as we move into the third quarter and the back half of the year. 
So with that, let me take a minute and let’s wrap up. 
Now, for revenue, let’s look back at our April Earnings Call. Now, we said we’d have modest revenue growth in services, and we did that. We said we’d have mid-single digit growth in systems and technology, and we did that. We said software performance would be consistent with first quarter, and we did that. In fact, we grew a point faster. And overall, we said we’d return revenue growth at constant currency for the corporation, and we did that. 
So for revenue, we did exactly what we said we were going to do. If you really look at the difference to analyst’s expectations, the difference is all currency. Due to the strengthening of the Dollar since our first-quarter earnings announce, that impact as we included in the supplementals, about $500 million. So our operations performance is really right on target. 
Now, we delivered 13% earnings per share growth despite a $0.10 to $0.11 currency headwind, and that’s compared to a very strong second quarter 2009 base. And we have a strong hand going into the second half, an improving profile in services, ongoing momentum in software and great high-end hardware product announcements. 
So with all that, and with at least $11.25 of earnings per share for the year, we’re now well above our 2010 roadmap projective building on 30 straight quarters of EPS growth. 
So again, thanks for joining us, and now, as always back to work.

Mark Loughridge 

Thank you for joining us today. This quarter we delivered $1.97 of earnings per share which was up 16% year-over-year. Our improving business mix and focus on driving productivity again delivered solid margin and profit performance. 
We increased pre-tax margin by a point and both pre-tax and net income were up 13%. We had great cash performance, increasing free cash flow by $400 million to $1.4 billion. We returned another $4.7 billion to shareholders with $700 million in dividends and $4 billion of share repurchases. The balance sheet is solid and capital structure is well positioned to support our full-year objectives. Our liquidity position remains strong as we finished the quarter with $14 billion of cash on hand. This was a very good start to the year. 
Our key investments are unique to the IBM strategy and are paying off. This quarter our growth markets were up 8% year-over-year at constant currency led by the BRIC countries which were up 14% as these countries build out and integrate their public and private infrastructures. 
Business analytics is one of the fundamental drivers of our software performance. Software revenue was up 11%, or 5% at constant currency, with share gains in each of the five middleware brands. Across software and services our business analytics revenue was up double-digits. In Services an increasing portion of our consulting business is driven by our Smarter Planet engagements and business analytics. This quarter consulting signings were up 18% or 12% at constant currency with the strongest consulting performance in over three years. So our growth initiatives helped drive our first quarter revenue performance. 
You may recall that in January we expected to improve our revenue growth rate from the fourth quarter to the first resulting in mid-single digit revenue growth at actual rates. Let me tell you how we did and give you a few highlights. Our first quarter revenue was up 5% year-over-year, though it was driven more by our business operations and less by currency. With a strengthening dollar, currency was less of a help, only contributing 5 points of growth versus the 6 to 7 points based on mid-January spot rates. This impacted revenue by about $250 million so our underlying business performance was better than expected. 
The improvement in revenue growth from our fourth quarter was broad based with improvements across each of our major segments and geographies. In our segment performance, systems and technology improved 11 points, software 9 points, global business services 4 points and global technology services 3 points; all at constant currency. By geography, America’s revenue growth improved 6 points, EMEA 5 points and Asia 4 points. The major markets rate improved 5 points and the growth markets 6 points, led by the BRICs. 
Keep in mind our solid annuity base, so our transactional growth rates drove these gains and so now, after a very good first quarter, we are increasing our earnings per share expectations for the year to at least $11.20 which is up $0.20 from our previous view of at least $11. 
Now I will turn to the detailed financial results for the first quarter. As I just mentioned, our revenue was up 5% year-over-year to $22.9 billion. Gross margin expanded 20 basis points due to better margins in Services and Software and more favorable business mix. Our expense was up 2% year-over-year. Within this, our operational performance was better 5 points but was more than offset by a 7 point impact from currency and a point of acquisition expense. Pre-tax margin was up a point year-over-year to 15.4% and net income margin expanded nearly a point to 11.4%. With continued margin expansion we increased both pre-tax and net income by 13% year-over-year. Finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a 2% reduction in our share count. So bottom line, we delivered $1.97 of earnings per share, up 16% from a year ago. 
Now I will turn to the revenue details starting with a geographic view. In discussing the geographic results, as always, I will focus my comments on constant currency. As I just mentioned, the improvement in revenue growth was fairly consistent across our geographies, with Americas better by 6 points, Europe better by 5 points and Asia by 4 points. Driving the 5 point improvement in the major markets growth rate we had better performance in each of the G7 countries. The best growth again came from the UK, which was up 8% year-over-year. 
In the growth markets, growth accelerated as market conditions improved in most countries. With 8% growth this quarter growth markets outpaced the majors by 10 points. The growth was led by the BRIC countries which represent about one-third of the growth markets. The BRIC year-to-year increase of 14% included strong double-digit growth in Brazil, India and Russia. Government spending and programs remains a tailwind in most countries and our strongest performance again came from the public sector. Within the growth markets, our biggest improvement from fourth quarter was in sales to our small and medium business clients driven by growth in Services, Power, Storage and System x. 
We are having great success expanding our footprint in the growth markets which provides a base on which to build a software and services stack. Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment, our services revenue growth improved from the fourth quarter in total and in SO, BTO, ITS, Maintenance and GBS. This was driven by growth in outsourcing signings on a trailing 12-month basis and growth in core consulting signings this quarter. 
Our software performance was excellent, up 11%. Targeted investments over the last several years have positioned us to capture growth in key areas like business analytics, storage management and business integration. This quarter our Systems and Technology business returned to growth, and we gained or held share in every brand. Turning to gross profit our improving business mix and productivity initiatives have yielded consistent improvement in our gross margin over time. This quarter, better margins in services and software and the relative strength of our software business resulted in gross margin expansion of 20 basis points. 
Now let’s take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total expense and other income was up 2% and together with a 5% increase in revenue, our expense-to-revenue ratio improved eight-tenths of a point year-over-year. The operational expense improved 5 points year-over-year. But it was more than offset by currency which impacted expense growth by 7 points and acquisitions accounted for one point. We are continuing to execute initiatives to increase efficiency and drive productivity, leveraging scale and our global footprint. This strategy has worked well over the last five years and will continue to produce over the next five. 
As always, I will lay out the roadmap of cost and expense items that had significant year-to-year impacts to our profit. First in March we completed the sale of our PLM operations to Dassault and we booked a gain of about $590 million. In our call in January I mentioned that the gain from this sale would be relatively offset by a charge for productivity actions. This quarter our workforce rebalancing charges were about $560 million. The majority of the spending was in Europe and Asia and we expect payback by the end of the year with most of the benefit in the second half. 
If you recall in the first quarter of last year we had a gain of almost $300 million associated with outsourcing our logistics business to Geodis and this was effectively offset by our workforce rebalancing charges of $265 million. So a very similar dynamic, with a gain offsetting our workforce rebalancing charges. In fact, when you look at the combined impact of the two unique items last year and two this year there is no impact on IBM’s year-to-year performance in the first quarter. Our bad debt expense was less than $10 million in the current period, an improvement of about $90 million from last year reflecting the improving credit environment. Our accounts receivable reserve coverage of 2.1% is down 30 basis points from last year though it is up slightly from year end. 
Finally, I will comment on the impact from currency. As you know, we hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. With the year-to-year change in currencies, this hedge of cash flow program generated a loss in the first quarter of this year as compared to a gain last year. The year-to-year impact in the first quarter was over $350 million which is roughly 60% in expense and 40% in cost of goods sold. Keep in mind that these hedging losses mitigate the translation gains elsewhere in the P&L. Though it is difficult to measure the currency contribution to the bottom line due to the impact of pricing and sourcing actions, we do not believe that currency, net of hedging activity, contributed to our profit growth in the quarter. 
So now let’s turn to our segment pre-tax margins. This is a snapshot of our margins by segment. The combination of the four unique items I just mentioned has no year-to-year impact on IBM’s total results but they do impact the year-to-year performance of the segments. For example, the workforce rebalancing activity this year was incurred in every segment but the PLM gain was booked in software. We have provided here a normalized view of the profit and margin dynamics by removing the unique gains and charges in both years to give you a better view of the underlying operational performance of the segments.
Now let’s turn to the segments, starting with services. The two services segments delivered $13.7 billion in revenue, up 4% year-over-year and down 2% at constant currency. This is a 3 point improvement in growth rate at constant currency versus the fourth quarter. Total signings were $12.3 billion, down 2% at actual rates and 7% at constant currency. If you exclude application management services signings, signings would have been up 4%. I will talk about our AMS performance in a moment. 
Total outsourcing signings were down 3% at actual rates and 8% at constant currency though strategic outsourcing signings were up 6%. As you know, outsourcing signings can be very uneven by quarter and it is important to look at the longer term trends. Total outsourcing signings on a trailing 12-months basis are up 5% at actual rates and up 4% at constant currency. 
Total transactional signings, which include integrated technology services, consulting and AMS systems integration, were down 1% at actual rates and 6% at constant currency. In the quarter, we did see a shift in demand toward our consulting offerings with consulting signings up 18%. Overall, we signed 13 deals greater than $100 million and backlog at the end of the quarter was $134 billion, up $8 billion year-over-year or up $1 billion adjusting for currency. Within the backlog we saw improved stability in our base accounts, with backlog erosion at the lowest level in two years. 
Now I will go into the key drivers of performance in the two services segments. In global technology services revenue in the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year as reported and flat at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue improved in the quarter and returned to growth at constant currency reflecting demand for BTO and strategic outsourcing over the last 12 months. In integrated technology services the revenue growth rate also improved from the fourth quarter.
Total GTS signings were up 1% at actual rates, down 5% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing signings were up 1% at actual rates, down 4% at constant currency. Strategic outsourcing signings were up 6% at actual rates with strong growth in North America. Integrated technology services signings were flat at actual rates, down 5% at constant currency. The strongest performance was in the growth markets, up 29% year-over-year, and we had improvement in labor based services in North America. 
Global technology services gross profit was up 8% year-over-year with margin up one-half point. Total pre-tax income was down 13% year-over-year as we absorbed a significant increase in workforce rebalancing charges. Looking at a normalized view of GTS margins, excluding the items I discussed earlier, PTI would be up 9% year-over-year with pre-tax margin expansion. This rebalancing activity will provide PTI benefit mainly in the second half of the year and with this activity behind us we expect that GTS will return to PTI growth and margin expansion over the remainder of the year. 
Turning to global business services revenue was flat as reported, down 5% at constant currency. This improved revenue performance from fourth quarter was driven by strong growth in consulting signings which yield quickly in the quarter and revenue from application management services signings over the last 12 months. Total GBS signings were down 6% at actual rates, down 12% at constant currency. This quarter, I am going to describe our signings performance for GBS the way we manage it, as two distinct businesses; consulting and application management services which includes both application outsourcing and systems integration. 
In consulting signings were up 18% at actual rates and 12% at constant currency. This is the first quarter we have had constant currency growth in consulting since the fourth quarter of 2008. We are starting to see a shift in customer buying patterns toward more transformational offerings which are reflected primarily in our consulting business. We have reengineered this business to align with the strategy around smarter planet and business analytics, making investments and adding significant talent. We are getting good traction from our growth initiatives. Consulting signings in growth markets were up 35% at constant currency and our smarter planet and business analytics offerings were 25% of total consulting signings. 
Now turning to application management services signings were down 23% at actual rates and 27% at constant currency versus a strong first quarter of last year where we had a handful of large deals. This is where we came up short versus our expectations in the quarter. AMS signings were down $700 million compared to last year. Now AMS has grown on a trailing 12-month basis but obviously it had an impact on our signings performance this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, services signings excluding AMS would have been up 4%. 
Global business services gross profit margin expanded 7/10 of a point this quarter to 27.3%. Pre-tax margin was down 1.6 points year-over-year. Adjusting for the unique items PTI margin was 12.4%, down one-half point year-over-year. To wrap up services, we had good improvement in revenue performance driven by outsourcing signings growth in both GTS and GBS over the past 12 months and a return to signings growth in consulting. This is important because consulting has been a good leading indicator and has the greatest impact on near term revenue performance. Both of these give us momentum going forward and we expect our services business to return to modest growth in the second quarter. 
Software had a terrific quarter with revenue of $5 billion, up 11% year-over-year or 5% at constant currency. These results are a direct result of our sustained investment in this space. Organic investments complemented by strategic acquisitions have enabled us to deliver unique capabilities and tremendous value for our customers. 
This quarter key branded middleware grew 13% or 8% at constant currency and gained share for the tenth straight quarter as we continue to extend our lead in the middleware market. Every one of the key brands gained share. We had very strong performance, especially in our business integration, analytics and storage management software. This contributed to great brand performance with WebSphere up 13%, information management up 11% and Tivoli up 23%. 
The software segment pre-tax income grew 54% or 25% after normalizing for the unique items. Pre-tax margin was up 9.6 points year-over-year to 36%. Normalized, we improved pre-tax margin 2.8 points to 27%. 
Now let me take you through some additional detail on the brands. WebSphere had another strong quarter. Business integration offerings which deliver value to customers by enabling them to make their processes more predictive, agile and collaborative grew over 20%. ILOG, which plays a key role in IBM’s Smarter Planet initiative by providing business rules management, did very well again this quarter growing over 30%. 
Information management software had a great quarter. Business analytics continues to be a key growth area for us. Cognos which was our largest acquisition ever posted strong double-digit growth and gained share, providing a proof point on analytics demand in the market. Tivoli had an excellent quarter and gained share across all three market segments. Within systems management, enterprise asset management which includes Maximo products grew double digits. 
This is a key component of our Smarter Planet strategy. Growth was broad based across geographies, most notably in the growth markets. Storage management software also grew double digits which complements the strong growth in storage hardware. We have had over 20 consecutive quarters of growth in Tivoli storage software. Finally, security had solid growth driven by strong sales across the portfolio. 
Lotus revenue growth improved significantly from the fourth quarter driven by 31% year-to-year increase in advanced collaboration. This software improves our customers’ productivity by enabling the efficient sharing of information. Rational software had a solid quarter with revenue growing 7% year-over-year. Rational provides an integrated suite of products to manage the business process of software and systems delivery. 
This quarter we completed the sale of our PLM operations where we have acted as a sales channel. Our participation in this business has been declining for some time and this transaction is in line with our strategy to divest of lower value businesses. The sale will have a positive effect on software margins immediately and improve our software revenue profile over time. Over the next year the loss of PLM revenue will impact our software revenue growth by 2-3 points. We will provide a view of our software revenue growth without PLM for the next four quarters to better reflect our ongoing business performance. 
Software had a great quarter, reflecting the strength of the portfolio and the value it delivers to our customers. We expect to continue the same level of revenue performance in the second quarter, of course adjusting for the PLM transaction. Systems and technology revenue was $3.4 billion, up 5% year-over-year, 2% at constant currency. This is an 11 point sequential improvement in year-to-year growth rates at constant currency. We gained share in storage, both disk and tape, system x, which includes 55% growth in blades, retail store solutions and the mid-range of Power which was driven by the introduction of POWER 7. We held share in high-end servers. 
Gross profit margins improved in storage, system x, retail stores and microelectronics OEM. In systems and technology we expect mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth in the second quarter and our new high-end products to help accelerate revenue growth through the second half, to double digits by the fourth quarter. 
Now, let me take you through more details on the brands. Power Systems revenue declined 17% year-over-year and we held market share. We have been taking share in UNIX for years. In the first quarter our success with competitive UNIX displacements continued with over 170 competitive wins totaling over $125 million for the quarter. This quarter we took share in both low-end and mid-range systems. In the mid-range where we introduced POWER 7 in February, we gained better than 2 points of share year-over-year. 
POWER 7 systems further extend our price performance advantage versus others competing in the UNIX space. We expect our share gains to continue in the high-end when we announce our new POWER 7 products later this year. 
Storage revenue grew 11% year-over-year. Disk grew 18% and gained share with double-digit growth in enterprise, mid-range and low-end products. In the high-end, growth was driven by XIV where we added 75 new customers to our XIV platform in the first quarter. Tape declined 5% but we again gained share. Our hardware storage results complement the strong performance in storage software, our storage hardware and software together grew 14%. System x server revenue grew 36% year-over-year. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of share gain in x86. 
Our improved sales model and enhanced product offerings are the key contributors to this performance. System x blades grew 55% year-over-year and gained 2 points of share. Gross profit margin expanded year-over-year driven by improvements in end-to-end operational efficiencies and the strong performance in blades. System z revenue declined 17% year-over-year. MIPS declined 19% in the first quarter after growing 18% a year ago. 
This performance is consistent with what you would expect at this point in the product cycle. Later this year we are releasing the next generation System z. Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 16% year-over-year. Our 300 mm fab is at near full utilization and our 45 nm output was sold out again this quarter. Systems and technology returned to revenue growth this quarter with strong performance in System x, storage, microelectronics and retail store solutions. I expect this growth rate to accelerate through 2010. 
Turning to cash flow, we generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow, up $400 million year-over-year. The growth was achieved off of a strong first quarter of 2009. The increase in free cash flow was driven by higher net income and improved cash from sales cycle working capital as collections remain strong. We delivered this $400 million increase in free cash flow even taking into account significantly higher tax payments, so this was quite an achievement. 
Below the free cash flow line we received about $450 million from the PLM sale which is reflected in the investing section of our cash flow and on the line labeled “Other” in this chart. Looking at our uses we completed five acquisitions for $800 million which is a good start to the year and we returned $4.7 billion to shareholders. $700 million was in dividends and $4 billion was in share repurchases which helped drive a year-to-year reduction in average diluted shares of just over 2%. We have $2 billion remaining from our board authorization. Overall, this was a great quarter for cash flow, especially for a first quarter. 
Now, let's turn to the balance sheet where we see the benefit of our strong cash performance. Even after funding investment and returning cash to investors we maintained a healthy cash balance of $14 billion which was flat from year-end and an increase of $1.7 billion from the first quarter of 2009. Total debt was $26.3 billion. Over $22 billion of debt is in support of our financing business which is leveraged at an appropriate 7:1 ratio. $4.1 billion is non-financing debt which is up $400 million from year end. 
We continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility in our model. Non-financing debt-to-cap was 18%, up 2 points from year-end and down 25 points from a year ago. The balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term. 
I will start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share performance. This quarter all categories positively contributed to our earnings growth. Starting with revenue, which contributed $0.09 of benefit, or about one-third of the total growth, this was the largest contribution we have had from revenue growth since the second quarter of 2008. Our ongoing work to improve our operating leverage resulted in gross margin expansion and expense productivity which together contributed $0.13. We also had a modest benefit from tax and share repurchase contributed another few cents. So our growth was delivered in a very balanced way, through revenue growth, profit expansion and an effective use of cash. 
Our performance in the first quarter was driven by the investments we have made to capture growth opportunities and our ability to deliver value to our clients. We had broad based improvement in revenue growth, across our segments and across our geographies. This improvement, together with a shift to higher value businesses and focus on driving productivity, again delivered solid margin and profit performance. 
We took actions in the first quarter to continue to transform the company; shifting to higher value areas and improving our structure. We completed five acquisitions in the first quarter, investing in key capabilities that support our growth initiatives. We divested of our PLM operations and after we get through the comparison in the next few quarters this will improve the revenue growth and margin of our software business. We introduced new mid-range Power offerings and will deliver high-end power and mainframe systems later in the year to drive share gains in the second half and we continued to increase the productivity of the business. These actions will improve our strategic position and our business model going forward. 
Given what we see in the short term and our work with the business units we expect a return to revenue growth at constant currency in the second quarter, with services delivering modest revenue growth, hardware improving to mid-single digits and software continuing its strong performance. We are confident in our ability to continue to improve our revenue performance, leverage our business model to expand margin, grow profit, generate cash and return value to our shareholders. So consequently we are increasing our expectations for the year, to at least $11.20 of earnings per share 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy 
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A I would like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. 
Second, I would ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I will turn the call back to Mark for final comments. 
Operator, please open it up for questions.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein
I was hoping you could comment a little bit on the IT spending environment and go over again what you said about revenue growth at the end of the call. On the IT spending side do you think we are back to a fairly normal IT spending environment? By that I mean normal sequential patterns in terms of market revenue growth. For IBM specifically on the revenue growth side perhaps you could just go through one more time your expectations for revenue growth. That is something new. You typically don’t comment on revenue growth for IBM. If we are in a more normal spending environment given that IBM historically has grown 3-4% a year at constant currency or call it 2-5%, in that range, should investors be expecting that IBM can grow in that range at constant currency for the remainder of this year? 
Mark Loughridge 

Let me start with your first question about the IT spending environment and revenue growth characterizing that compared to more normal IT spending levels. First of all, as we went through it we made it the second chart in the pack and you can see how our growth rates improved across our brands and across our geographies. So to me, STG up 11 points. Software up 9. GVS up 3. Very good, uniform performance on that content highly driven by the strength of our transactional performance and our STG and software business. 
I think even more interesting to me as you look across the geographies look at how uniform that improvement in growth rate is going from the fourth quarter to first quarter. Americas up 6 points. EMEA up 5. Asia up 4. The major markets improving 5 points of growth. Growth markets up 6. Within that BRIC up 7 with IBM total revenue up 5. That is very consistent with the direction we gave when we posted fourth quarter. We talked about we ought to be seeing improved performance in our revenue growth rates both in actual and in constant currency going from the fourth to the first. Actually within that at the time we had assumed currency would be an assist of 6-7 points and actually it came out more like 5 points. Given that we actually exceeded our own objectives here we did much better on the operational performance to compensate for that currency effect. 
The second thing I will say across the spend environment, we are seeing a transition in the kinds of deals and the IT spend mix that our customers are looking for. Specifically in this quarter you can see that transformational offerings especially within consulting were much more highly driven with consulting signings now up 18% or 12% in constant currency. That is very strong performance. We haven’t had that growth rate in the consulting business for over three years. I thought that was very encouraging in an area of the business that yields more quickly. 
Now whether we are back to normal IT spend, that is a longer term view of the world. Obviously I would like to see this momentum continue but what I see within the IBM equation is we have a very strong play to improve our revenue performance now going into the second quarter with the services businesses now returning to modest growth, software continuing its very powerful performance up 11% in the first quarter. I thought that was very encouraging to see that kind of growth in our most profitable business continuing to fuel the remix in our business equation. 
In hardware now taking advantage of improved transactional content within our transaction base and now moving into the second half we have substantial announcements coming up. I think it is all good and positive performance on that transactional side the way I see it now. There will be the offset with PLM and that is about a 2-3 point impact in software growth but we are normalized for that going forward. Generally if you look across the characteristics I feel like we have a good hand going into the second quarter.

The next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital. 
Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital
Can you talk a little bit more about your raising of guidance? Just a few things that I had hoped you could highlight. If I use the lower than expected share count I think I get pretty close to the $11.20. I assume that is not what you want us to be changing. Can you talk about maybe the benefits of the cost cutting and other reasons why you raised the guidance? Maybe even highlight currency? The puts and takes. 
Mark Loughridge

Sure, let me go through that. First of all when you look at that guidance to be 90-days into the New Year and take that guidance up $0.20 I think that is a pretty significant improvement in our view of the year. That improvement was really driven by the strength we see in the quarter, the strength in the operational performance. I covered a number of these points in the last question but much better signings performance in our consulting business. Software transactional performance in the first quarter up 28% at constant currency and 24% at actual. Hardware returning to growth with good announcements in the quarter but very exciting announcements as we move into the second half. 
If you look at what accounts for the improvement going from $11 to $11.20, that improvement is based on our confidence as we now have closed I would say a very good first quarter. Now within that, there are a number of different mechanics under the hood we can talk about. First of all, one you had mentioned if you look at the workforce rebalancing work we did that was predominately in Europe and Asia. So it has a slightly longer payback. We said it pays back within the year. If you look at that it is about $550 million of benefit predominately in the second half of the year. 
I would say that would yield about 2/3 because the balance of the third now that we are in more of a growth mode the balance of that third we can use now for investment to drive our revenue. So let’s say about 1/3 of that $550 million. That would be about $0.20. Now as I pointed out earlier that is partially offset by the $0.07 impact from PLM with the PLM impact starts in the second quarter. The benefit of the workforce rebalancing is really in the second half of the year. I think that gives you kind of a framework. 
I also want to comment if you look at improving the guidance from $11 to $11.20 remember that when we were in the second quarter of 2007 we established a roadmap that we said just having completed a year at $6.05 we thought we had a very good chance to improve that to at least $9.00 by the time we got into 2010 with a potential range in 2010 to 2011 depending on the performance of our pension fund. Here we are talking about $11.20, well beyond that roadmap objective. So I think we have done pretty well especially having gone through a recession and within that recession recording earning per share growth every quarter at a fairly substantial rate. I feel good about the guidance. I feel good about the business as we exit the first quarter. The workforce rebalancing will have benefit but that will be predominately in the back half of the year. 
Frankly when you look at your to-go increase based on our increase in our EPS guidance I reserve most of that to go increase for the back half of the year.

The next question comes from the line of Katie Huberty – Morgan Stanley. 
Katie Huberty – Morgan Stanley 
A follow-up on the margin question. Any reason we wouldn’t see a nice uplift and perhaps better than seasonal uplift in gross margins in the back half of this year in light of the high-end server cycle that kicks in in the second half and then the back end loaded cost savings? 
Mark Loughridge 

We certainly have as you point out, we have a strong base as we go into the second half of the year. First of all it is the savings out of workforce rebalancing that will be substantial. In addition as you pointed out new and exciting announcements on the high end of our server line which drives substantial margins and [inaudible] substantial margin in the business. So I think we have a very good base going into this second half of the year.

The next question comes from the line of David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners. 
David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners
Could you help us better understand your divestiture strategy particularly the thought process around balancing mature free cash flow, [yielding businesses] and growth? 
Mark Loughridge 

Absolutely. Let’s link the discussion on divestitures with acquisitions because they are part and parcel partners in this strategy of ours. First of all, if you look at the ongoing strategy we have we want to move into intellectual property based businesses that are highly scalable and related to driving the solutions offerings we have; solution offerings like business analytics for example. 
What we are doing on the [audio break] side, on the divestment side, is moving out of businesses that have lower growth prospects and lower margin prospects. If you look at the divestitures and the acquisitions in the quarter I think they are perfect examples of that strategy. The PLM business we remarketed their product. We didn’t own the intellectual property; they owned the intellectual properties and as we worked through this with the sale it made more sense for them to actually run that sales and marketing themselves rather than for us. 
At the same time we invested in five very strong candidates that do have a lot of intellectual property and that intellectual property is aligned with the strategic objectives we have set for ourselves. So I think this is actually a perfect example; divesting of lower growth, lower margin commoditizing content and monetizing content and moving that investment base into higher growth, higher margin intellectual property that we think is highly scalable and aligned with our strategic trajectory. 
David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners
Can you give us a sense of how much may still be out there in terms of things that would fall into the same category as PLM in terms of scale? 
Mark Loughridge 

I think that is a very fair question. We have had that question a number of times I would say over the last decade. Oftentimes we have had divestitures and our analysts look at them and say well that might be about it. We are looking at next year IBM’s centennial. We are investing and driving for another centennial. So this is going to go on all the time. This is going to be a constant process of regeneration and renewal and transforming our business base into new opportunities that we think have better margin and better growth prospects and I think there is no better example than looking at the profit mix of the software business from 2000 to 2008 and you can see how much that expanded. That was a strategic choice.

The next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner – Citigroup.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
You made reference to the weakness in App management bookings. I was hoping you might be willing to give us a little bit more detail on the reasons for that? Maybe also a word on what you saw in the systems integration portion of that and generally your view of the services pipeline going into Q2, long-term versus short-term and what type of bookings growth expectation you have for the services business for the full-year this year? 
Mark Loughridge 

First of all if you look at the AMS, it was down about $700 million year-over-year. It faced a prior year where they grew signings 23% and they had a handful of very large deals. It was a challenging quarter for that business and that business did quite well last year. We grew signings 14% for the year. So a good double digit performance in 2009 and a particularly strong first quarter to compare to. 
If you look at across the services base of business on a signings base, we do think that when we go into the second quarter we have a very good deal list with good odds so there is no reason we shouldn’t be growing signings at a reasonable level as we go into the second quarter. If you look at booking expectations I think that is going to be characterized quarter by quarter. Right now we see a pretty good pipeline going into the second quarter and as I said we will be returning to signings growth.

The next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan. 
Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan 
I want to come back to the transformation activity in terms of consulting services. Is this shift you are seeing, do you see this as a multi-quarter or multi-year shift? How should we think about the gross margin, operating margin profile? Could we see incremental leverage from this over the next year or two?  
Mark Loughridge 

Let’s look at first of all your question on transformation especially related to consulting services. If you look at the consulting performance as we pointed out signings were up 18%. Underneath that, underneath that performance it is interesting to note that North America was up 26% and GMU was up 35%. In fact we had growth in four of our five major IOCs in the consulting. A pretty broad based phenomenon with real strength not only in our major markets like North America but also in our growth markets, up 35%. 
If you look at the content underneath consulting in our base of business it was about 25% of base of business that was business analytics and Smarter Planet so you can see the linkage that consulting momentum grew to other parts of our business. Business analytics where is its biggest component? It is obviously in software. We have reviewed with you the acquisitions and organic investments we have made in business analytics and software as well as the organic investments, mathematical expertise and research given we are now the largest private sector math department in the world. 
All of those work together to help drive that equation and move that transformation through a number of our business units. Given the investment we have made in this obviously we are looking for a multi-quarter, multi-year growth in that business analytics opportunity. So, with that business analytics is a great example of moving into solution offerings with a big software base in the framework or the deliverable and that software base comes at very high margins. It is part of the mix shift that you have seen starting in 2000 driving much more of our profitability through that high margin business.

The next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman – BMO Capital Markets. 
Keith Bachman – BMO Capital Markets 
I wanted to go back to revenue growth if I could and how you are thinking about IBM in 2010. A different way, if you look at the EPS bridge for the first quarter of 2010 versus 2009 about 1/3 of your EPS growth was related to revenue at actual. If you think about what you provided of at least $11.20 for the year, how do you think the revenue growth will contribute to that? Is it more than 50%? 
Mark Loughridge 

Well I am not going to give specific percentages to break that down. We do think we are clearly, based on the improvement of revenue growth rates from fourth to first and then the comments we made working with our general management going from first to second, we believe we are in a better framework for revenue as we go through the year. When you look at the components underneath the $11.20 we run multiple scenarios. We run scenarios with higher revenue growth rates in geographies; higher revenue growth rates in GMU versus major markets, higher revenue growth rates with higher margin content along business analytics; we do alternatives if the growth rate comes in the more transactional content as opposed to the [inaudible] content and what is the impact in currency. 
Just in currency alone if you just look at the 90-day change in spot rates, in a quarter, that alone has impacted the actual revenue growth by about $1.5-2 billion. There is not just one scenario we look at to drive our view of the year. We look at multiple scenarios. We look at our flexibility to drive that and what we are delivering I think is a view of the world is in that least number. To us and to me that is a high probability base looking forward.

The next question comes from the line of Bill Shope – Credit Suisse. 
Bill Shope – Credit Suisse
In the past mainframe cycles have been a key driver, at least a key stimulus for IBM’s not [hardware] segment. Is that something we should anticipate in this coming cycle? Or has the direct link between mainframe and the services and software portfolios been diluted somewhat over the years? 
Mark Loughridge 

The thing I am always more impressed with is how dynamic the different plays and different solutions are in the corporation that cut across different product lines and avenues. We are certainly not dependent on any one set of announcements or strategies within the company. Now that said, this mainframe cycle looks typical to me and we have a very powerful announcement set up for the back half of the year so I am very optimistic in the upcoming announcements for both z series and our high end POWER 7 series.

The next question comes from the line of David Bailey - Goldman Sachs. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs
Last quarter you had commented that you had a number of large software deals that didn’t close in Q4 and fell into Q1. I was wondering if you could help us understand how big a factor that was in your Q4 software result and did you see a return to more normal close rates this quarter? 
Mark Loughridge 

Great question. We did track those deals as they rolled from fourth to first. As you look at them we did close a number of them but really the closure rate was very similar to 2009. So, on a year-over-year basis they really didn’t have much contribution to our overall growth. Our growth in this quarter was really driven by the operational performance in the quarter by our software business driving that 11% growth rate.

The next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank. 
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank
You bought back about $2 billion more of stock than I expected during the quarter. Can you maybe update us as to what you expect to use your liquidity for going forward? Where do acquisitions sit versus buybacks? How are you thinking about that equation going forward? 
Mark Loughridge 

Good question. When you look at the acquisition base we had in the first quarter I thought we had a pretty darned good start. That is $1 billion of acquisitions spread across five very strong opportunities for us and demonstrates our commitment to acquisitions as an ongoing play. At the same time, we purchased $4 billion in the quarter. If you compare that to the prior year’s that does look like a large first quarter but I caution you really the prior year was impacted by the equity impact that we had in the business leaving 2008. So in other words when we had the big pension impact due to lower returns that in turn impacted our equity and our debt to cap went to about 48%. 
So last year we had to be fairly careful about equity based transactions and the impact on that. We are not in that situation this year. We are not in that situation. If you look at our debt to cap now it is 18%. That is very conservative. We have $14 billion of cash. We just finished the quarter with $1 billion of growth acquisitions, $4 billion in share repurchase, $700 million in dividends. Now I would tell you as you all know this is a power reserved to the board and we have about $2 billion left in our authorization. I would think it would be more practical to compare this year’s acquisition opportunities and this year’s share repurchase opportunities especially on the latter base to what we saw in 2008 as opposed to 2009. 
So thank you very much for your questions. Let me just wrap up here. We had a very good start to the year including real progress on the top line. Our best growth came from software which is our most profitable and highest value area. We had great growth in consulting signings which as you know tends to be a leading indicator. We started the introduction of our high-end servers which we will continue to roll out later in the year and drive hardware growth in the second half. 
Overall we are encouraged by our performance in the first quarter and the position we are in for the rest of the year. That is why, just 90 days into the year we are taking up our EPS expectations for 2010. With at least $11.20 for the year we are well ahead of our 2010 roadmap objectives and we will talk to you again at our investor briefing on May 12th. But for now, as always, it is back to work.

Now, I will turn the call over to Mark Loughridge. 

Mark Loughridge

Thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter capped off a great year for IBM driven by continued margin expansion, profit growth, and cash generation, all in an uncertain environment. 
Let me start out by sharing a few financial highlights. In systems, we had substantial share gains in POWER 4 points, System X 3 points, Blades 6 points and storage 1 point. In software, we had share gains in WebSphere, Tivoli and Key Branded Middleware and in services we booked $18.8 billion of services signings and $57 billion for the year. 
In 2009, outsourcing signings were up 9% or 11% at constant currency. Once again we had great profit and margin performance. This quarter, PTI grew 10%. We expanded margin and grew pre-tax profit in every segment. 
As we indicated in October, we had double-digit profit growth in Systems and Technology, up 15% for the year. PTI margin was up 2.8 points led by Services up over 2 points, Software up over 5 points and Financing up over 6 points. When you put this all together, we delivered EPS of $3.59, which is up 10% and $10.01 for the year, up 13% making this our seventh consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. 
Now let me give you another perspective on 2009 EPS. In May 2007, we established our roadmap, with an EPS objective for 2010 of $10 to $11. With EPS of $10.01 in 2009, despite a challenging economy, we got there one year early. In 2010, we expect to deliver our eighth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth, or at least $11 of earnings per share for the year with consistent EPS growth throughout the year. 
For the first quarter we expect a 4-5 point improvement in IBM’s year-to-year revenue growth rate from the fourth quarter at both actual rates and constant currency. This would result in mid single digit revenue growth at actual rates with software posting double-digit growth. We are confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand margin, grow profit, generate cash, return value to shareholders and return to revenue growth in 2010. 
Now, before moving on to the details of the quarter I want to take a step back and talk about our performance over the longer term. You can see that we have consistently generated strong profit and cash growth since the last recession in 2002. So let’s look at what we have accomplished recession to recession. 
Since 2002 we have added $12 billion to our pre-tax profit base. Our pre-tax margin is up 2.5 times. Our EPS is up four times and cumulatively we have generated about $80 billion of free cash flow. This is the result of a dramatic transformation we started at the beginning of this decade. It is driven by a combination of shifting our business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity and investing to capture growth opportunities. 
Let’s take a look at these three initiatives. First, we have been remixing our business to move to the higher value areas. We exited commoditizing businesses while at the same time acquiring 108 companies since 2000 for a total of almost $22 billion. These portfolio actions have contributed to a significant change in our mix of business. In 2000, services segments PTI was $4.5 billion and in 2009 it is over $8 billion. 
Our software profit growth is even more impressive. In 2000 software segment PTI was $2.8 billion and in 2009 it is also over $8 billion. That is almost tripled. In 2009, over 90% of our segment profit came from software, services and financing with software and services each contributing 42% of our segment PTI. The unique portfolio of businesses we have built, heavily weighted toward software and services, generates high profitability and we will continue to remix to higher value through organic investments and acquisitions. 
Second, we have had an ongoing focus on driving operating leverage through productivity. We are leveraging our scale and global footprint to improve processes and productivity in a number of areas like support functions and service delivery. In 2009 we yielded $3.7 billion of cost and expense savings from the structural actions we have taken. Along with mix, this helped drive our 1.7 point improvement in gross margin and 9% reduction in operational expense for the year. These actions are reducing our fixed cost base and improving the operational balance point. This will provide a real advantage as the spending environment improves with solid operating leverage off of our now leaner cost base. 
Third, our strong margins and profitability enable us to make significant investments for growth. We have been investing to capture the opportunity in the emerging markets as these countries build out their public and private infrastructures. In 2009 while the economic environment slowed globally our revenue growth in the growth markets remained 8 points faster than the majors. We have been investing in capabilities that differentiate IBM and accelerate the development of new market opportunities; areas like business analytics, cloud computing and smarter planet. 
In 2009 we invested almost $6 billion in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership. Last week we announced that for the 17th consecutive year we were number one in U.S. patents with over 4,900 in 2009. That is more than the total of Microsoft, HP, Oracle, Apple, Accenture and Google combined and consistent with our shift in business mix, about 70% of our patent portfolio is for software and services. We have complemented our organic investments with acquisitions and one of our primary investment areas is business analytics which provides a solid platform for our Smarter Planet initiatives. 
Since 2005 we have invested $10 billion or $8.5 billion net in 14 strategic acquisitions to build our business analytics capabilities. These acquisitions delivered strong results in 2009 generating 9% revenue growth at constant currency. So over the last decade we have driven a significant transformation of our business and we will continue to shift to higher value areas, improve efficiency of our business and invest where we see the best long term opportunities. All of this positions us for growth as we move into 2010. 
Now I will turn to the detailed financial results for the fourth quarter. I will start with a quick walk down the P&L for the quarter. Our revenue was $27.2 billion, that’s up 1% year-to-year, and down 5% at constant currency. With continued strong margin performance, we increased pre-tax income by 10% and net income by 9%. Gross margin expanded 40 basis points due to better margins in services and systems. 
Our expense was better by 5% year-to-year driven by actions we have taken to continue to transform and globalize the business and focused expense management. Pre-tax margin was up 1.9 points year-to-year to 23.4%. With an increase in our tax rate year-to-year, net income margin expanded 1.3 points to 17.7% and finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a lower share count year-to-year, though it was up sequentially due to increased dilution because of the higher stock price. 
So bottom line, we delivered $3.59 of earnings per share, up 10% from a year ago and I will remind you that we had 18% EPS growth in the fourth quarter of last year so this is double-digit growth off of a very strong base. The balance sheet is solid and capital structure is well positioned to support our strategy. Our liquidity position remains strong. We finished the year with $14 billion of cash on hand. 
Now let me get into the fourth quarter details, starting with revenue by geography. In discussing the geo results, as always, I will focus my comments on constant currency. 
The major market growth was consistent with the last couple of quarters. In the fourth, the UK had solid growth and sequentially we improved performance in Canada and Japan. The growth markets once again outpaced the major markets in the fourth quarter by 9 points of revenue growth. For the year, the growth markets grew 8 points faster and contributed 19% of IBM’s geographic revenue. This quarter, the BRIC countries were up 7% driven by growth in India, Brazil and China. For the full year, China grew 10%. 
In China, we are leveraging our broad portfolio to provide comprehensive solutions to our clients. Recently we announced one of the largest and most comprehensive consulting engagements to date in China, where we are helping to build smart eco-cities across the country. 
We see growing opportunity around the world, much of which is outside the traditional IT opportunity, to help our clients drive efficiency in their physical infrastructures. 
Turning to the results by segment, I will get into the specifics within each of the segment discussions, but let me give you a snapshot of the revenue and gross profit performance. 
Our total services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with third quarter and we had year-to-year growth in both signings and backlog. In Software, we gained share in key branded middleware. We had a number of transactions that didn’t close this quarter, and we are entering the first quarter with a very strong pipeline. Systems and Technology year-to-year growth improved again in the fourth quarter with share gains in most brands and particular strength in System x. 
Across all of our segments we had great margin performance. Our productivity initiatives have yielded consistent improvement in our gross margin over time. This is the 21st quarter of the last 22 that we have expanded our gross margin. Now that’s quite a streak. 
Now let’s take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total expense and other income was down 5% and our expense-to-revenue ratio improved 1.5 points year-to-year. The expense reduction was driven entirely by operational expense which improved 15 points year-to-year. Mitigating this improvement, currency impacted expense growth by 9 points and acquisitions by one point. 
We have been executing our operational plan to increase efficiency and drive productivity, leveraging scale and our global footprint. We have focused on all areas of the business and this year we yielded $3.7 billion of cost and expense savings from a number of initiatives such as the globalization of our support functions and rebalancing our workforce. These actions reduce our cost base and make it more variable. A lower level of fixed cost improves our operational balance point, so as we return to growth we’ll get better operating leverage off of our cost base. 
To close out the discussion on spending, as always I will lay out the roadmap of items that had significant year-to-year impacts to our profit. First, accounts receivable provision was better by about $70 million year-to-year, driven by a lower level of additions versus last year. Our reserve coverage is flat year-to-year at 2%. 
Second, we had a year-to-year benefit of about $80 million from investment transactions driven by a charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to an investment in a joint venture. 
Third, consistent with what we told you in October, we had workforce rebalancing charges of about $100 million in the quarter virtually all of it in Europe. These charges are down $340 million from last year’s fourth quarter. Impacting profit growth, our retirement-related plans were worse by $100 million in the fourth quarter. As we described last quarter, we had a one-time curtailment gain associated with a non-U.S. plan of about $120 million. We also had an unprecedented regulatory charge in Germany. 
Let me explain. Companies with German pension plans are subject to mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage. In the fourth quarter, we received notification of a significant premium increase due to the level of insolvencies of other companies in Germany in 2009. This does not relate to the IBM plan, it is other companies’ plans in Germany. This premium increase resulted in an annual charge of almost $140 million, a year-to-year impact of $120 million in the quarter though the cash impact will be spread over five years. 
So this quarter we had a large gain and an unanticipated offsetting charge in our retirement related costs neither of which is related to our operational performance. For the full year 2009, retirement related plans, including this insolvency insurance charge, cost about $1.4 billion. This is relatively flat versus 2008. 
Let me comment on the performance of our pension plans. In the U.S. plan, return on assets was up 11% for the year. Our non-U.S. plans which comprise about 40% of our assets, in aggregate were up 14%. So globally, our pension plans were up 12% for the year. Looking forward, we will hold our expected U.S. long-term return assumption at 8% and we will take our discount rate down to 5.6% reflecting the current interest rate environment. 
In 2010, with these assumptions, together with other factors such as changes in actuarial assumptions, we expect retirement-related cost and expense of about $1.5 billion, a year-to-year increase of almost $100 million. From a funding perspective, we ended the year with total assets in our defined benefit plans of $82 billion. Our U.S. plan is fully funded, and globally our qualified plans are 99% funded, so we have made great progress in a year. 
I will comment on two other items. With the year-to-year change in currencies, our hedge of cash flow program generated a loss in fourth quarter 2009 as compared to a gain last year. The year-to-year impact in the fourth quarter was over $430 million which is roughly half in expense and half in cost of goods sold. 
Our tax rate was 24.6% in the quarter, up 80 basis points year-to-year. For the full year 2009 our tax rate was 26% and for 2010 we expect a tax rate in the range of 26 to 26.5%, so fairly consistent on a year-to-year basis. 
So now let’s turn to our segment margins. This is a snapshot of both gross and pre-tax margins by segment and as you can see, the improvement is broad based. Our PTI margin improvement of 1.9 points was led by Systems and Technology, up 2.6 points; Software, up 2.4 points and Global Financing, up 5½ points. 
I will comment briefly on our Global Financing business. We are emerging from a challenging credit environment with strong financial results in Global Financing. Our financing business remained focused on core competencies, providing IT financing to our IBM customers and business partners and delivered both gross profit margin and PTI margin expansion this quarter and we ended the year with a return on equity of 34%. 
Now let’s turn to the segments, starting with Services. In the fourth quarter, the two services segments delivered strong margin performance and good growth in outsourcing signings to cap off a very strong year. For the full year, the combined services businesses delivered $8.1 billion in pre-tax income, up 11% year-to-year. Pre-tax margin was up 2.3 points to 14.1%. This improved margin was a result of the structural changes we have made to services delivery over the past several years. The global delivery capabilities we have built proved to be dynamic and flexible enough to deal with very tough market conditions. 
Our backlog at the end of the year was $137 billion, up $7 billion year-to-year and over $2 billion sequentially. We delivered $57 billion in new services business with outsourcing signings up 11% at constant currency for the year. Outsourcing signings growth was broad based. We grew across all major geographies; the Americas, Europe and Asia and we grew in each of our outsourcing categories; Strategic Outsourcing, Business Transformation Outsourcing and Application Outsourcing. Overall, we had very strong margin and signings performance in what was a difficult economic climate. 
Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. Our services segments delivered revenue of $14.6 billion, up 2% at actual rates, but down 5% at constant currency. Total signings were $18.8 billion, up 9% at actual rates, or 2% at constant currency. Within that, total outsourcing signings were up 15% at actual rates and 8% at constant currency and we signed 22 deals greater than $100 million. 
Now I will go to the key drivers of performance in the two services segments. In Global Technology Services, total GTS signings were up 3% at actual rates but down 4% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing signings were up 5% at actual rates, down 1% at constant currency. For the year, GTS outsourcing signings at constant currency were up 8% with major markets up 7% and growth markets up 14%. 
Integrated Technology Services signings continue to be impacted by client deferrals and capital constraints. However we have seen stability in the past two quarters in smaller transactions under $5 million. Global Technology Services revenue in the quarter was $10.1 billion, up 4% at actual rates or down 3% at constant currency. Revenue trends in outsourcing should improve through 2010 as we start to see the benefits of 2009 signings. In Integrated Technology Services, revenue performance largely reflects signings performance which continued to be impacted by declines in OEMs as we shift our portfolio to higher value offerings. Global Technology Services improved gross margin nearly a point and pre-tax margin 60 basis points to 15%. For the full year, Global Technology Services gross profit margins expanded in all lines of business and total pre-tax margin was up 3 points. 
In Strategic Outsourcing we have improved gross margin for five consecutive years while improving overall service delivery quality. We have accomplished this through a disciplined and innovative approach to delivery focused on both labor and non-labor productivity actions. As you know, we have been executing a strategy to deliver services out of key global delivery centers using consistent global delivery methods and processes. 
We are continuing to expand our capabilities with new centers in Dubuque, Iowa, Cairo, Egypt, and Wroclaw, Poland. We are also improving labor utilization with analytics and by applying supply chain tools and techniques to our labor base. In Integrated Technology Services we improved margin by mixing toward more profitable labor- based services and in Business Transformation Outsourcing through improved deal selectivity and delivery performance. 
Turning to Global Business Services signings were up 20% at actual rates and 13% at constant currency. Application Outsourcing signings were up 65% at actual rates and 55% at constant  currency. For the full year signings were up 25% at constant currency. This performance illustrates the strong value proposition that Application Outsourcing can provide our clients with compelling cost savings. 
Consulting and Systems Integration signings were up 3% at actual rates, down 3% at constant currency, a significant improvement over third quarter. This quarter small deal performance improved as the quarter progressed. General Business and Distribution Sectors grew and the growth markets were up 34% at constant currency. 
Global Business Services revenue was down 3% at actual rates, 9% at constant currency while pre-tax margin improved 1.1 points to 16%. This was a record level of pre-tax margin driven by strong utilization in our delivery centers, good subcontractor resource management and spending management. Throughout the year this dynamic delivery model has enabled us to perform well in a tough economic climate and this quarter we saw some of the leverage our delivery model can provide with profit growth on lower revenue. 
Overall, we feel encouraged about the business as we saw improving trends in revenue, margin and signings. So our two services segments did a great job delivering value and managing margin in a very challenging year. We believe that our dynamic infrastructure and delivery capabilities are paying off. It is what enabled us to deliver on our profit objective of $8 billion for the year and we are well positioned heading into 2010 with double-digit outsourcing growth in 2009, backlog of $137 billion, improving trends in Global Business Services and a delivery structure that has enabled us to perform exceptionally well in a tough environment. 
Turning to Software, revenue of $6.6 billion was up 2% year-to-year, down 4% at constant currency. Key Branded Middleware grew 6% and was flat at constant currency. Branded Middleware gained share for the ninth straight quarter as we continue to solidify our lead in the middleware market. In fact, it represented 63% of our software revenue in the quarter. That is up 2 points year-to-year. 
Software pre-tax income was up 10% and pre-tax margin was up 2.4 points year-to-year to 41.5%. For the full year we delivered 14% profit growth in software and expanded margin by 5 points. Software delivered over $8 billion of pre-tax income; nearly triple the profit in 2000. 
Now let me take you through the brands. WebSphere had another strong quarter growing 13%, or 6% at constant currency and gained share. Business Process Management, Commerce and Data Power product segments all grew double-digits. ILOG, which drives business rules management, did very well again this quarter and contributed to WebSphere growth. Information Management software was up 7% or 1% at constant currency and held share. 
Business Analytics continues to be a key growth area. Cognos posted strong double-digit growth and gained share providing a proof point on analytics demand in the market. IBM’s acquisition of SPSS further strengthens our business analytics and optimization strategy by delivering predictive analytic capabilities that help customers drive better business outcomes. Info Sphere Warehouse, which helps our customers turn information into a strategic asset, also grew double-digits. 
Tivoli grew 7%, or 1% at constant currency and gained share. Enterprise Asset Management, which is part of IBM’s Smarter Planet strategy, grew over 40% in emerging markets. Tivoli storage continued its robust growth as customers manage their rapidly growing storage data. Data Protection as well as Storage Management grew double-digits with broad- based geography and sector growth. Lotus software declined 5% or 11% at constant currency. Rational declined 4% or 10% at constant currency and held share. 
Although Software faced a difficult compare against a very strong fourth quarter of last year we saw continued strength in the demand for software in the Growth Markets, strong growth from our recent acquisitions and an increase in the volume of small deal activity in North America. So all very encouraging signs. There were a number of large deals, however, that did not close during fourth quarter and have contributed to a very strong first quarter opening pipeline. Consequently, we expect Software to grow revenue double-digits at actual rates in the first quarter. 
Systems and Technology revenue was $5.2 billion, down 4% at actual rates and 9% at constant currency. While our revenue performance bottomed in the second quarter of 2009 the rate of year-to-year decline has sequentially improved in each of the past two quarters. We had strong growth in System x and blades and improved performance in microelectronics. We gained share in System p, System x, blades and both disc and tape storage. 
Gross profit margins improved year-to-year in all brands and for Systems and Technology in total. This quarter marks the highest gross profit margin for this business since fourth quarter of 2007 driven by improvements in our System x server business and converged p. Bottom line, Systems and Technology pretax profit grew 15% year-to-year in the fourth quarter. 
System z revenue declined 27% year-to-year. MIPS declined 19% in the fourth quarter. Over the past two years, MIPS grew 4% compounded. This is consistent with what you would expect at this point in the product cycle. Later this year we are releasing the next generation System z. Converged System p revenue declined 14% year-to-year and gained 4 points of market share. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of market share gains. 
System p has gained share in 10 of the last 12 quarters. In the fourth quarter our success with competitive UNIX displacements continued with almost 200 competitive wins totaling nearly $200 million in the quarter. For the year, we had over 500 competitive wins which generated sales of over $600 million. Later this quarter we will introduce the next generation Power systems which will deliver 2 to 3 times the performance in the same energy envelope. So quite an announcement for this product line. 
System x server revenue grew 37% year-to-year taking 3 points of share. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of share gain. Our improved sales model and enhanced product offerings are the key contributors to this performance. Total System x blades grew 56% year-to-year and we expect to gain 6 points of share in blades. Storage revenue grew 1% year-to-year but was down 4% at constant currency. Disk grew 6% and gained share. Disk growth was driven by strong growth in midrange and XIV. 
In fact, we added more than 130 new customers to our XIV platform in the fourth quarter and 400 since the acquisition. Tape declined 10% but gained share again in fourth quarter. Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 2% year-to-year. Our 300 mm fab is at near full utilization and our 45 nm process output was sold out again this quarter. 
Systems and Technology closed out 2009 with improving year-to-year revenue dynamics, gross margin improvements in every brand, pre-tax income growth of 15% year-to-year and a margin of 15.4%, up 2.6 points year-to-year. Quite a performance for our hardware business. 
Turning to our cash performance we generated $7.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, down $600 million year-to-year. For the year, our free cash flow was up $800 million to $15.1 billion. This is our seventh consecutive year of free cash flow growth. The year-to-year improvement was driven by growth in net income, higher cash from sales cycle working capital and lower CapEx. This was mitigated by higher retirement-related payments. 
When I look at uses of cash for the year we reduced our debt by $7.5 billion and we returned $10.3 billion to shareholders. $2.9 billion of this was through dividends and we bought back almost 69 million shares for $7.4 billion including $3.1 billion this quarter. At the end of the year we had $6.1 billion remaining from our last board authorization. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we finished 2009 with a substantial cash balance of $14 billion. Cash is up $2.5 billion from September and $1 billion from last December. Our strong free cash flow enabled us to add to our cash balance while reducing our debt by almost $8 billion from last year. 
Our total debt balance is now $26.1 billion. Of this, $22.4 billion is in support of our Global Financing segment which is leveraged at 7.1 to 1. So, our non-financing debt was $3.7 billion, down almost $6 billion from a year ago. As a result of the debt reduction and growth in equity, our non-financing debt-to-cap is now 16%.  The balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term. 
I will start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share performance. This quarter, revenue growth contributed to our earnings growth. Our ongoing work to improve our operating leverage resulted in gross margin expansion and expense productivity which together contributed $0.30 of the $0.32 of EPS growth. We also had a modest benefit from share repurchases but it was offset by a higher tax rate. 
For the year you can see the benefit of the shift to higher value areas and focus on driving efficiency in the spending base as margin expansion and expense productivity by far were the largest contributors to our earnings growth Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed another $0.34 and tax rate provided a very modest help of only $0.03. 
All in, we delivered EPS of $10.01, our seventh consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. This was a great year in a tough environment all a result of the strategic transformation of our business. We have been shifting to higher value businesses. This better positions us to meet client needs and drives a more profitable mix. In 2009, software and services each contributed 42% of our segment profit. 
We have also been globally integrating our company to improve productivity and efficiency. Our ongoing productivity initiatives have reduced our fixed cost base and improved the operational balance point, generating more profit from each dollar of revenue. With a spend base of almost $80 billion we have got a lot of opportunity to continue to reduce structure and make our business more efficient. This operating leverage will provide a real advantage as revenue performance improves in 2010. 
We are using our strong profit and cash base to drive the significant investment needed to expand our base of opportunity both organically and through acquisitions. We are positioned to capture the secular growth opportunity in the emerging markets and we are investing in areas like our Smarter Planet solutions, business analytics and new compute models such as cloud computing. 
In addition to supporting investments in growth initiatives and acquisitions our great cash position and strong cash flow allow us to return capital to shareholders. This year we spent over $10 billion on share repurchases and dividends and increased our dividend for the 14th consecutive year. Bottom line, the changes to the company have allowed us to deliver strong performance since 2002 and even over the last two years in a tough environment. More importantly, the transformation has positioned us to come out even stronger in 2010 and as I said earlier, for the full year, we expect EPS of at least $11 for the year. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy 

Thank you Mark. Before we go to the Q&A I would like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. Second, I would ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A I will turn the call back to Mark final comments. Operator please open it up for questions.

Operator

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Richard Gardner – Citigroup. 
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
First of all, I was hoping you might be willing to provide either quantitatively or qualitatively some sort of waterfall to your double-digit EPS growth estimate in 2010. Then as an adjunct to that, can you tell us which segments have the most room for further structural market expansion over the next 2-3 years. Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge 

Let me put this in context. I think as we go into 2010 we should go back and look at the overall roadmap for 2010 because frankly the progress that we anticipate making in EPS is going to be very similar to the rollout and the balance that we had in that original roadmap. Now just to review that it had an element of our typical [weather] growth, our margin expansion actions, our share repurchase actions, our investments in growth, our acquisition focus and then lastly actively repaying the pension. But I would contrast 2010 to 2009 as 2009 working through a recession with as much pressures we had on the revenue line it really required us to over-weigh the contribution to margin. 
You saw the actions we put together to do that. We put out $3.7 billion of spend. We achieved some very strong margin performance across our business lines but as you look at 2010 I would contract it. We will still have margin expansion? Absolutely. Consistent with our overall roadmap but I don’t think it is going to be over-weighted to margin like it was in 2009. In 2010 it should be a more balanced performance on revenue performance with new product and a more stable economic environment. You saw that as we described improving our growth rates from fourth quarter to first quarter between 4-5 points both in constant currency and at actual rates. You will see the ongoing focus and contribution to margins. 
As we get the better revenue performance that revenue can now take advantage of the improved leverage in our business as we are able to take all this spend out as a matter of efficiencies. In addition we are always driving tools and content to drive that efficiency. Process efficiencies, standardization, tools and analytics. If you look at the first quarter we will have a gain from the sale of our PLM business offset by a charge predominately in Europe and Asia for productivity actions. 
So those will continue to drive our margin performance. Then in addition we are still very focused on share repurchase and on share repurchase we had contracted a little. You will remember we closed out last year fairly high core debt to cap at 49%. So we were relatively cautious and I think conservative concerning share repurchases. Now we enter 2010 big recovering of pension funds so now our core debt to cap is in a very, very conservative 16%. So share repurchase is still [front point now]. You have to admit if the share price was higher we will still have a lot of dilution at that share price but we will still have good contributions and share repurchase. 
I am most interested in the momentum that will pick up from our growth investments. Our investments in Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and Cloud Computing and the contribution we get from those as well as the ongoing performance in our acquisitions. As you saw in the fourth quarter acquisitions performed very well. Very well. 
Again, the way I would look at it is in 2010 we should see a more balanced contribution to our EPS growth from all of the elements of the overall roadmap and opposed to 2009 when it was over weighted on margins and can be a recessionary end. 
Now when you look at the segment that has the most room for further structural margin content they will all benefit from the structural actions that we are taking across the board as a corporation and I would say as you look at overall margins though we have had very good gross profit margin and I am very encouraged by it over the last 22 quarters I think we have expanded 21 of those 22, we are still not in that top quartile of margin performers in the S&P 500 or the Tech Universe Top 330 companies. So I think our objective should be to firmly engage in that top quartile.

The next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein
This quarter IBM grew at minus 5% constant currency. Last quarter you grew at minus 5% in constant currency but the comparison was actually easier this quarter. So given what appears to be from your commentary an improving economic environment were you surprised you didn’t see better revenue growth? I know you called out some software deals not closing. Maybe you can dimension how significant that was in the quarter and whether there were other reasons why we didn’t see better revenue growth in light of a modestly easier compare year-over-year and then an improving demand environment? 
Mark Loughridge 

Sure. I think that is a very good question. If you look at the content businesses one of the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter that was quite encouraging is the performance of smaller deals. That is smaller deals across our hardware business, our software businesses, our services business both in major markets and [inaudible] in our growth markets. 
Number one, smaller deals are a significant portion of our total revenue stream but I think what we are seeing in smaller deals have been more characteristic of a leading indicator. So as we entered the recession those smaller deals produce a little more aggressively than we see them coming back especially at the end of the quarter. But what is interesting about it, it was across our business units as well as in the major markets and growth markets. So with the stronger small deal performance entering the third quarter that gives us a level of confidence. 
Secondly, we did literally have a lot of large deals that were fairly well progressed in the quarter roll over for the first quarter especially in our software business. That is why software at actual rates we see in the double-digit level performance as we go into the first quarter. Then additionally we have seen this trend through the year in our hardware base of business after we kind of bottomed out in the second quarter that the growth rates will improve every quarter as we went from third quarter to fourth quarter and with our new announcement that we see in p. series in the first quarter we think that should also help improve that level of performance. 
So you put all those together and all the work that the teams and the general management have done on their pipeline and their deals and that is why we feel pretty confident we should be able to improve the relative growth rate by 4-5 points as we go from fourth quarter performance to first quarter performance over constant currency and actual rate. That would put us at actual rate kind of a mid single digit level of growth.

The next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital
Over the last four years you have averaged about 18% EPS Growth and your guidance is basically 10% plus for the year as we enter an upturn in IT spending and economic activity. You said you have more leverage in your OpEx given things you have done and you have room for a buyback and your pension expense was in line with where you said it would be. My question is are you just being conservative or is there anything out there with the economy or anything else in the P&L that keeps you conservative? That hedging loss year-over-year was the big number that kind of surprised me. The $430 million. Maybe that is a hit in upcoming quarters so you are being conservative? If you could you just go through that that would great. Thanks so much. 
Mark Loughridge 

When you look at it from my perspective sitting here January 19th and looking out for the close of the year to be a double-digit EPS growth coming off of what really is seven consecutive years of double-digit EPS performance. I think that is a pretty strong statement. So for us to come out this early and peg that I think is pretty strong. Obviously if revenue performance turns out to be even stronger than what we are looking at now then we should have upside to that number. 
Frankly as we looked at it I pegged the at least $11, and I remind everybody that is an at least number, a kind of flat constant currency performance of the year. If it is better than that then we certainly have upside. On that base we do see some encouraging signs in our business but frankly our indicators are based on that 90 day framework so I would like to get into that first quarter and get a little more validation that it is an ongoing recovery before we take this up further than we have. I think 10% growth in what would be a 8% year coming in at the very high end of the roadmap we had set for 2010, I think that is a pretty strong position.

The next question comes from the line of Robert Cihra - Caris & Company. 
Robert Cihra - Caris & Company 
I wonder if you can get any more in depth you went through the geos and verticals for the quarter but maybe you can give us an idea for where you see real, concrete improvement and then maybe where there are alternatively persistent weakness. Particular within verticals, for example public held in nicely for you. It looks like financials have gotten better. Can you give us any more specifics? Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge 

Sure. You look at the overall industry performance the financial sector was quite consistent in the quarter with the average within that they had strength in the growth markets and we saw that clients within financial services continue to focus on cost reduction, capital [inaudible] and compliant so that is actually very consistent. Distribution likewise was consistent. You have to look at it and distribution has now improved two quarters in a row. Frankly underneath that the retail industry saw growth for the first time in seven quarters. 
As we said, if you look at public sector it had the strongest performance in the quarter and for the year. For the year public sector is up about 4%. If you look underneath that, in the quarter we had growth in healthcare and life sciences that marked an 11th consecutive quarter of growth there in growth markets across all industries as well as [government] where we can focus on services that will reduce costs. 
So as I look at it going into 2010 that kind of maps the value propositions we are putting on the table. Within each of these sectors I can tell you that the CFO’s and the client meetings that I have, they are very interested in this transformation capability for their business and the benefits that clear business analytics can provide there and within public sector across major cities the advantages of Smart Planet. So I think we have new solutions entering in these key areas that can help these organizations transform as we go into a more stable climate.

The next question comes from the line of David Bailey - Goldman Sachs. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs
Looking out at 2010 how should we think about additional costs and expense savings or will spending start to increase on a net basis as your revenue grows again? 
Mark Loughridge 

When you look at the cost and expense what they are doing that is going to be an ongoing part of our overall business model. That has been a part of the 2010 roadmap and that should continue. So we are going to see good cost and expense productivity. Now it is not going to be at that level of $3.7 billion spend takeout we saw last year. The dollars we are investing in that are more focused on Europe and Asia but we are going to have good spend takeout and it is going to be complemented this year by I believe better revenue performance that will capitalize on the improved leverage we have in the business. Those two together should I think put us in pretty good shape as we continue to drive our margin performance.

The next question comes from the line of Katie Huberty – Morgan Stanley. 
Katie Huberty – Morgan Stanley 
Did you see better momentum in large deals in the Systems business during the fourth quarter that would suggest that behavior may flow into software early this year? As a follow-up is there any pent up demand in the hardware business given the component constraints during the quarter? 
Mark Loughridge 

Well if you look at our technology business did much better in the quarter and were in fact much better loaded as we go into 2010. I think the important part of the overall hardware performance is number one the year-over-year growth rate has improved every quarter since we brought about in the second quarter. Very strong performance across some elements like x series. I think we are seeing some of the effects of the overall product cycle in our businesses as we enter 2010 where we will have new announcements in Z series and new announcements in p series. I think what we saw was an improving level of performance and within that characteristic more [series an variety] are positioned in the product cycle. As we go into the first quarter like the other elements of our business we are expecting that our STG business should improve their revenue growth rate by that same range of 4-5 points.

The next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank. 
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank
I wanted to ask about the deal pipeline we are seeing in services and if you have it can you give any color on what you expect for 2010 bookings growth? 
Mark Loughridge 

If you look at the progression of the pipeline in services I would reiterate the point I made earlier that in services signings like the other elements of our business we had an improving performance in the small deal content. That was characteristic for both sides of the business. I would also say if you look at major market and major markets are still very focused on cost take out, capital conservation, transformation. The GMU markets still are very focused on big infrastructure plays. We saw some really strong deals in that GMU content. 
So as we go in for the first quarter, recognizing that the fourth quarter we had in our total signings 2% growth, constant currency 9% in actual rates as we look to the first quarter in total I think we could be a little stronger than that but that the trend underneath it is improving performance I think on a year-over-year basis in our short-term deals and long-term deals continue in ongoing growth.

Lou Miscioscia – Brigantine Advisors
Maybe you could give us a comment about Europe, obviously one of the weaker geographies and it seems like the Americas and Asia Pacific is picking up. Are you starting to see any trends here. Then can you comment on some of the other locations there? 
Mark Loughridge 

I think when you look at the US performance, North America performance and Europe it is kind of consistent with what we saw in major market performance. Now we do see major market performance improving as we go into the first quarter and we did have very strong performance in the U.K. and some sequential performance in other areas. I thought it was a fairly tight band around that. 
The thing you clearly saw though is the difference between major market performance and growth market performance actually expanded in the quarter to about a nine point differential. When we look underneath it I thought we had pretty good performance in Brazil, India, China and all in that mid to high single digits. The element that really stabilized underneath it is Russia came in relatively flat performance. Russia has actually been declining for the first three quarters of the year given the concentration on raw materials. So Russia a bit better. Better stability process. Growth markets now growing faster than major markets by about nine points for the year. It closed at about eight points which has been very consistent for the last couple of years. I thought the performance between North America and Europe was really a fairly tight range. Though across those, we see improvements in the growth rates from fourth quarter to first quarter.

The next question comes from the line of Scott Craig – Bank of America. 
Scott Craig – Bank of America 
You mentioned in the first quarter you are going to still have an offset to a gain on the sale from actions you are going to be taking. Are these actions still greater than what you would consider some of the normal efficiencies you are trying to bring out in the business on an annual basis? Can you quantify perhaps the gain on sale you think you will get in the first quarter? 
Mark Loughridge 

I don’t think I am going to quantify the gain. We have a lot of work to do to close out that deal right now. What I will tell you is if you look at the overall actions that are driving productivity it is pretty consistent with what we have incurred on a charge basis for the last couple of years. I don’t think it is different than that. What you will see at least as we start out the year is more of that will be associated, or dominated really by Europe and Asia but that overall level of charge will be very consistent with the last couple of years.

The next question comes from the line of David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners. 
David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners
You have given us several data points on the changes you have made in the business and its impact on margins. Can you share your thoughts on whether these changes impact the revenue growth of the business as the cycle kicks in? Should we think of secular revenue growth any different in a normalized economic environment? Then perhaps what you were thinking going into the downturn two years ago or 2.5 years ago? 
Mark Loughridge 

You know when you look at the transformation in the business that we have been working so diligently on really I would say, it is not overstating to say the last decade, our objective there was to exit businesses that were commoditizing and didn’t have strong margin potential. I think more importantly than that it was businesses that didn’t have good value proposition to our customers. That is what we are moving towards. So as you look at the money we spent buying those 108 acquisitions since the year 200 for $22 billion and go down that what you are going to see is those are big value plays for us with their growth prospects. 
So we are moving out of business that we don’t think has the same growth prospect and doesn’t have the same margins and moving into businesses with better value contribution and better growth prospects that fit within the solution orientation. There is no better example of that than business analytics. When we look at business analytics we think that opportunity is going to be as big as TRM or ERP. We will see. We invested about $10 billion or about $8.5 billion net to acquire 14 companies to build that capability. They weren’t just add on, bolt on capabilities. It was really moving the corporation into this higher growth, higher margin and to our customers higher value opportunity space. 
That is our objective. I think if we had the compounded opportunity of moving into better growth with better margins. You can see that underneath as well that mix of strategic Middleware within our software business is at one of our highest levels we have ever had. Those strategic Middleware products have by their nature better growth characteristics. 
Let me take the opportunity now to just wrap up. We feel very good about our performance. In fact I would say it was pretty remarkable given the economic environment. We achieved 2010 EPS objectives I would say one year earlier. I don’t think I am over-stating it. If you look back at the comments that we all pulled together when we announced that in second quarter 2007 I think that is a kind of validation it was achievable to get in that $10-11 by 2010 but to hit it one year early I think is a pretty strong performance despite a two-year recession. If you look at 2010 we have guided to the high end of the range in an at least characterization. 
All of this, especially the last question was a result of the transformation we began a decade ago. It is also very good execution and using the flexibility in our business model to adapt to market conditions. The structural actions of continued investments throughout the downturn have us better positioned going into 2010 than 2009. We have got improved revenue growth performance, better operating leverage, a good set of opportunities in emerging markets and in areas like business analytics and Smarter Planet. 
So you put all of that together it leads to another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2010 with at least $11 of EPS for the year. Thank you very much for joining us today.

Mark Loughridge
Thank you for joining us today. We just finished another great quarter, driven by strong profit performance in software and services, and share gains in both hardware and software.  
This quarter our revenue was up sequentially and our growth rate improved versus second quarter. We expanded gross margin by almost 2 points and pre-tax margin by over 3 points year to year.  Our earnings per share is up 18% to $2.40.  In addition, we generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow, up almost $1.3 billion year to year, and ended the quarter with $11.5 billion of cash on hand, while reducing our debt by $4 billion since June. We now expect to deliver at least $9.85 per share for the year, up $0.15 from our previous view of at least $9.70. 
When you look at the third quarter as compared to the second quarter, though earnings per share growth is the same, both up 18%, we extended our share gains this quarter. For instance, in software we gained almost 3 points of share in WebSphere, where we compete head-to-head with Oracle.  We also gained share in Information Management, Tivoli, and Rational.  These share gains drove 5 points of constant currency growth in branded middleware revenue. 
In hardware, we gained 5 points of share in System p, and 2 points of share in System x. That’s lot of share and we’re taking it from both Sun and HP.  These share gains drove the improvement in our hardware revenue growth rate, which is 11 points better than last quarter.  
Revenue growth from our services business was fairly consistent with second quarter, but the real story here was our ability to deliver double-digit profit growth by continually expanding margins.   This quarter our services pre-tax margin was almost 15%.  On a comparable basis our services margin is better than any of our key competitors.  And believe me, we’re not done. Overall, with an improving trend in revenue performance, we’ve continued to generate profit growth through margin expansion. 
Over the last several years, we have been shifting to higher value areas, and significantly changing our mix of business. At the same time, our ongoing focus on driving productivity in all areas of the business is reducing our fixed cost base and improving the operational balance point. 
We continue to expect about $3.5 billion of cost and expense savings this year from the structural actions we’ve taken.  And remember, we’ve got a spend base of almost $90 billion to work, so we’ve got a lot of opportunity to continue to reduce structure and make our business more efficient. 
The impact of our transformation on this quarter’s profitability is clear and compelling.  Our combined services segment pre-tax margin was up 2.4 points year to year, and in software, we grew segment pre-tax profit by over 20%, and margin by over 6 points.  For the year, we continue to expect to generate about $8 billion of profit in software, and $8 billion in services. 
We’re using this strong profit and cash generation to invest in capabilities that differentiate IBM and accelerate the development of new market opportunities, areas we’ve discussed in the past, like business analytics, and Smarter Planet, and cloud computing. Now we’ve just closed a strong third quarter consistent with the momentum in our business throughout 2009, and we’re well-equipped going into the fourth quarter. 
Now, let’s get into the details of the third. Our revenue was $23.6 billion, down 7% as reported, and 5% at constant currency. Despite the revenue decline, we increased pre-tax income by 12% and net income by 14%, with outstanding margin performance. Gross margin expanded 1.8 points, due to better margins in services and software and a more profitable mix of business.   
Our expense was better by 11% year to year, driven by actions we’ve taken to continue to transform and globalize the business, and focused expense management in a tough environment. Pre-tax margin was up over 3 points year to year to 18.6%, and IBM’s Net Income margin was up 2.5 points to 13.6%. 
And finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a lower share count year to year, though it was up sequentially due to increased dilution. So bottom line, we delivered $2.40 of earnings per share, up 18% from a year ago. 
Now let’s turn to revenue. Our total geographic revenue was down 7% as reported and 5% at constant currency. As always, I’ll focus my comments on constant currency. 
Revenue growth improved versus the second quarter in every geography.  Americas was down 4%, 3 points better than second quarter.  EMEA was down 6%, and Asia Pacific was down 4%, both improvements from last quarter. 
Turning to the major markets and growth markets, we had improved performance in the major markets. The U.S. was down 5% year to year, an improvement of 3 points.  The growth markets were down 1%, though China had great performance, up 26%. Overall the growth markets delivered 19% of IBM’s geographic revenue in the quarter and outpaced the majors by 5 points of growth. 
So now let’s turn to revenue by sector. Total sector revenue was down 7% as reported and 5% at constant currency, which is one point better than last quarter’s growth rate. Since the third quarter of last year, Financial Services performance at constant currency has generally been in line with the total sector performance.  This quarter, Financial Services revenue growth at constant currency improved 5 points versus last quarter, down 2%. Within FSS, the banking industry returned to growth at constant currency. Public sector was again the fastest growing sector with 2% growth at constant currency, led by Healthcare and Education.  Now I think this is quite logical given the rollout of stimulus spend globally. 
Let me give you an example of what we’re doing with a healthcare client.  At St. Elizabeth’s Hospital in Kentucky, IBM is helping to connect hospitals, clinics and physicians offices in the state’s largest roll-out of electronic medical records to improve patient care and lower costs.  The system is expected to replace a warehouse full of paper-based records on more than 50,000 patients in the St. Elizabeth Healthcare system. These are real systematic approaches to improving healthcare.  
Communications sector was down 6% at constant currency, but underneath it, the utilities industry grew. We are working on nearly 50 smart grid engagements across growth and major markets. Let me give you an example here as well.  IBM is providing expertise in smart metering, large meter data management, business analytics, and security to help Oncor, the largest electric delivery business in Texas. This quarter, Oncor achieved a significant milestone, the reporting of interval meter data to the market.  With our help, Oncor is expected to replace over three million standard meters with advanced meter systems by 2012. 
Distribution sector performance improved slightly from second quarter, down 9% year to year at constant currency.  In the growth markets we had strength in the travel and transportation industry as infrastructure investments in airlines and passenger rail continue. 
While Industrial sector also improved, it remains the most challenging, down 14% at constant currency, as clients are impacted by the economic downturn and are focused on cost-cutting to position for the recovery.  
Now let’s turn to revenue and profit by segment. Our ability to deliver value to customers and our ability to take share in a competitive market resulted in improved revenue performance. Software was driven by strong demand for our key branded middleware. Services has a solid recurring revenue base, but also reflects challenges in the more economically-sensitive consulting business.  And hardware had significant share gains, and cut its rate of decline in half from last quarter. Our gross profit margin improvement of 1.8 points in this environment was quite impressive.   
As part of our ongoing transformation, we continue to shift to higher value, the most obvious driver being the mix to software, which contributed almost one-third of the margin improvement.   
This quarter, our ongoing initiatives to improve our services margins through global delivery capabilities and improved resource deployment models, also contributed to the improvement. Our initiatives are driving consistent improvement in our gross margin over time.  In fact, this is the 20th quarter of the last 21 that we’ve expanded our gross margin. 
Now let’s take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. 
Our Total Expense and Other Income was down 11%. Currency drove 5 points of the decline and reflects both translation of non-dollar based expenses, and the impact of the hedging programs that flow to expense. Acquisitions contributed a point of growth. But the largest contributor to expense reduction was our operational expense, which improved 8 points year to year. 
With almost $90 billion of cost and expense to work with, we’ve been executing our operational plan to increase efficiency and drive productivity, leveraging scale and our global footprint.  We’ve focused on all areas of the business, from sales efficiency to supply chain management to service delivery to global support functions. And we’re on track to yield $3.5 billion of cost and expense savings in 2009 from our recent initiatives, such as the globalization of our support functions and rebalancing our workforce. The initiatives reduce our cost structure and make it more variable.  A lower level of fixed cost improves our operational balance point, so with improved operating leverage, every dollar of revenue yields more profit. 
At the same time, our strong margins enable us to continue a significant level of reinvestment, focusing on capabilities that will help to drive the next growth cycle by delivering value to clients.   
One of our primary investment areas is business analytics.  Advanced analytics software and services allow customers who generate enormous amounts of data to predict trends, optimize their operations and create new sources of revenue.  It provides a solid platform for our Smarter Planet initiatives.   
We’re continuing to add to our capabilities.  We’ve just closed another key acquisition, SPSS, a leader in predictive analytics. With this, we’ve now invested $9 billion in strategic acquisitions since 2005 to build our business analytics capabilities. And we recently announced a new advanced analytics center in New York City, with 450 consultants and researchers connected to the service line we launched earlier this year. 
To close out the discussion on spending, as always I’ll lay out the roadmap of items that had significant year- to-year impacts to our profit. 
Two items hurt our profit growth. We had a year-to-year impact of $100 million from investment transactions, driven by Lenovo transactions in the third quarter of last year. And within Other Income and Expense, interest income was down almost  $70 million year to year, reflecting the current interest rate environment. 
A few items helped our profit growth. First, I’ll start with accounts receivable provision.  Last year our reserve coverage was 2.0%, this year it’s 2.2%, so we’ve got a higher rate of coverage year to year. But with revenue down, and receivables down, this level of coverage resulted in a year-to-year reduction in AR provisions of about $150 million. Second, our workforce rebalancing charges were down over $50 million. And finally, we have a $100 million year-to-year benefit from our hedge of cash flow programs, reflected in Other Income and Expense, SG&A, and Cost of Goods sold. 
Our Retirement-related plans had little impact on our profit growth this quarter, but let me comment on the fourth quarter. As you know we’re constantly working on our plans, and in the 4th quarter we expect a one-time curtailment gain of over $100 million due to a change we’re making in our non-US plans. This will be more than offset by additional workforce rebalancing activity outside the U.S.  We now expect retirement-related cost to be about $1.3 billion for the year.  
So now let’s turn to our segment margins. This is a snapshot of both gross and pre-tax margins by segment. With gross margin up 1.8 points, and expense reduction of 11%, we delivered a 3.2 point improvement in pre-tax margins.   
And as you can see, for the second consecutive quarter our pre-tax performance was led by GTS, up over 3 points, and Software, up over 6 points. Overall, we delivered pre-tax margin of 18.6%. As you can see on the next chart, there’s a lot of room to continue to improve these margins. 
Looking at the S&P 500, 25% of the companies have pre-tax margins above 20%. And if you look at the tech universe, as defined by the companies with a market cap over $1 billion, 30% are above 20%. So with our mix to higher value and higher margin areas such as software, and our ongoing initiatives against our nearly $90 billion of spend, we have a lot of opportunity to continue to expand margins, and drive profit growth. 
Now let’s turn to the segments, starting with Services. Despite the continued challenging economic climate, the combined services businesses drove an 11% increase in pre-tax profit and expanded pre-tax margin 2.4 points to 14.9%. We’re improving margin by focusing on a competitive cost structure, while delivering value and quality to our customers.   
In the quarter, we signed $6.7 billion in total outsourcing contracts, up 1% year to year. In addition, we signed three deals in the first two days of October with a total value of nearly $1 billion. These three deals would have pushed our outsourcing growth rate to 16% at constant currency, which is consistent with the first half performance of 18% growth.  With a solid start to the quarter and looking at the pipeline of deals we have, we should be able to grow outsourcing signings double-digits in the fourth quarter.   
Signings in our shorter-term offerings of Consulting and Integrated Technology Services continue to reflect the economic environment.  These signings were down a combined 16% at actual rates and down 15% at constant currency. Total Services signings were $11.8 billion, down 7% year to year.  We signed 13 deals larger than $100 million. 
Backlog at the end of the quarter was an estimated $134 billion, that’s up almost $3 billion since second quarter and $5 billion year to year.  Excluding currency, it’s up $1 billion year to year. So that puts us in a pretty strong backlog position as we enter the fourth quarter and 2010. 
Now I’ll go to the key drivers of performance in the two services segments. In Global Technology Services, total signings were down 11% at actual rates and 10% at constant currency. Outsourcing signings were down 9% at constant currency, but with the three deals signed by October 2, GTS outsourcing signings would have been up 10% at constant currency. 
Global Technology Services revenue in the quarter was $9.4 billion, down 2% at constant currency. Year-to-date outsourcing signings are up a very strong 13% at constant currency, which will add to the revenue base over a longer period of time.   
In Integrated Technology Services, we continue to shift our portfolio to higher value, higher margin offerings.  Revenue performance largely reflected several quarters of signings declines in the OEM offerings that support capital intensive product roll-outs. So while this quarter we had lower signings and revenue in ITS, the shift to higher-margin standardized offerings, as well as a mix away from OEM, gives us better year to year and quarter to quarter gross profit performance. 
Global Technology Services delivered strong gross profit contribution across all lines of the business, with total pre-tax profit up 24%.  Margin improved 3.4 points year to year to 15%.  This was the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit pre-tax profit growth. The margin performance continues to be driven by the structural changes we’ve made in Service Delivery and a shift to higher value in Integrated Technology Services. Global Delivery, tools and automation, Lean process techniques, Hardware and Software optimization, and subcontractor efficiency all contribute to productivity improvements.  And we have maintained the focus on our customers, with high levels of quality, customer satisfaction and Services Level Agreement performance. 
Turning to Global Business Services, signings were down 1% at actual rates and down 2% at constant currency. Application Outsourcing signings were up 42%, and 39% at constant currency, with strong growth in both major and growth markets.  Application Outsourcing can provide our clients with compelling cost savings, driving out both application maintenance costs and legacy application costs.  Our pipeline has been steadily improving and our rolling four quarter signings growth rate has now turned positive. 
Consulting and Systems Integration signings were down 18%.  Signings continue to be impacted by economic conditions on a global basis.  However, we did have good signings growth at constant currency in North America, up 20%, and Public Sector globally, up 7%. 
Global Business Services revenue was down 11%.  With a year-to-year margin improvement of a half a point to 14.5%, Global Business Services delivered better than balanced pre-tax profit, down 9%.  In a tough environment, our business continues to be supported by a very dynamic delivery model. Our global delivery infrastructure and framework includes expanding global delivery capabilities, scalable subcontractor management, and improved resource deployment models.  This quarter, these capabilities enabled us to drive improved cost and expense management, lower subcontractor spending, and improved utilization, both in our delivery centers and overall. 
So overall for services, the teams did a good job managing margin in a tough environment.  We believe that the dynamic infrastructure and delivery capabilities we’ve built give us a real competitive advantage and it’s why we are confident that we’ll be able to deliver segment profit of about $8 billion for the year. 
Systems & Technology revenue was $3.9 billion, down 12% year to year at actual rates and 11% at constant currency, consistent with what we said in July. These results will substantially outperform the industry, gaining share in Systems & Technology, in servers, and in storage. We now expect STG to deliver double-digit profit growth in the fourth quarter. 
System z revenue declined 26% against a very strong compare.  MIPS were down 20%, but up 9% on a two year compounded growth rate.  This performance is consistent with what we would expect at this point in the product cycle. 
This quarter we introduced a set of new System z workloads called System z Solution Editions, which expand the platform’s value proposition to both new and existing customers. System z gross profit margin expanded by 4 points year to year driven by a higher mix of upgrades in the quarter. Converged System p revenue declined 10%, or 9% at constant currency, and we gained 5 points of share. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of share gains. 
We have increased the revenue generated from competitive displacements of both Sun and HP customers to over $150 million this quarter.  This amounts to more than $400 million in sales from UNIX competitive takeouts year to date.  
System x server revenue grew 1% year to year, or 3% at constant currency. We took 2 points of share, and it’s our third consecutive quarter of share gains in x. Our improved sales model and enhanced product set are the key contributors to this performance. System x blades grew over 20% year to year and we gained 2 points of share. Storage revenue declined 13% year to year.   
In disk, we again gained share. Our storage acquisitions, XIV and Diligent, had strong performance.  XIV added more than 65 new customers during the quarter, and over 275 customers since we purchased the company.  We gained share in tape as well, as we continue to displace competitors. Microelectronics OEM revenue was down 1% year to year, a significant improvement over recent performance.   
Our 45-nanometer  technology was sold out in the quarter.  When you look at the broader demand for our 45-nanometer  technology, we are building POWER7 now, and are on track for our systems launch in the first half of 2010.  We have strong yields, in fact we are running five months ahead of our 65-nanometer ramp, so this is going very well. 
Systems and Technology revenue performance significantly improved from last quarter as we took market share in a tough environment.  In System p, we took 5 points of share.  In System x, we took 2 points, and also 2 points of share in blades.  And in both disk and tape storage we gained share. Gross profit margins increased in most of the brands. This team did a really good job this quarter and STG is on track to deliver double-digit profit growth in the fourth quarter. 
Software revenue of $5.1 billion was down 3% year to year, but flat at constant currency. We had another quarter of market share gains in software and very strong profit performance.  Segment pre-tax income was up 21% year to year and pre-tax margin was up 6 points to 32%.  
Key Branded Middleware grew 2% year to year, or 5% at constant currency, and we gained share year to year for the eighth consecutive quarter. Before we discuss the brands, I would like to comment on the makeup of our software business and why we focus on Key Branded Middleware.   
On the right side of the pie chart are primarily our legacy products, which generate substantial profit and cash. On the left side is our Key Branded Middleware, the fastest growing portion of our portfolio, as you saw again this quarter.  As this middleware becomes a larger percentage of the total, it lifts the overall software growth rate. This quarter, Key Branded Middleware was 57% of total software, up 3 points year to year. 
In software we have a broad portfolio of products that have a strong value proposition in this environment.  Many of our products, like WebSphere Portal and Tivoli Storage, deliver a fast payback.  These types of products grew 8% at constant currency year to year in this quarter. And our transformational offerings, including Cognos and Information Integration, grew double-digits at constant currency. 
Now let me take you through the brands. WebSphere had another exceptional quarter.  In this space our primary competitor is Oracle, since they acquired BEA.  This quarter we gained nearly 3 points of share with revenue growth of 14%, or 17% at constant currency.  Application Servers, which provide customers with secure and resilient infrastructure for mission-critical business applications, grew 11%, or 14% at constant currency.  Business Integration software, which includes our very successful ILOG acquisition, grew over 30% at constant currency. These two solutions are key components of our WebSphere offering. Information Management software was flat year to year, but grew 3% at constant currency and gained share. 
Cognos and InfoSphere software, which enables continuous and extremely fast analysis of massive volumes of data, both posted double-digit growth at constant currency and gained share. These are two key components of our business analytics offerings. IBM’s acquisition of SPSS, which was completed in early October, further strengthens our business analytics and optimization strategy by providing predictive analytic capabilities that help customers drive better business outcomes.   
Tivoli had another strong quarter growing 5%, or 8% at constant currency. Tivoli grew and gained share across all three product areas, systems, security and storage management. Our enterprise asset management software grew over 25% year to year and is a key component of our Smarter Planet offerings.  
This past week we announced Smarter Transportation projects with three of the largest and busiest mass transit systems in the U.S., Long Island Rail Road, Bay Area Rapid Transit and Washington DC Metro. All three of these clients are using Tivoli’s asset management offerings to predict where and when equipment needs to be repaired or replaced, ultimately improving the safety and reliability of the transportation system while reducing traffic congestion in these cities.   
Lotus software declined 9%, or 8% at constant currency.  With this performance we held share.  Lotus continued to be impacted by a softening in demand driven by customer consolidations and downsizing.  Rational grew 2% or 5% at constant currency and gained share. Rational’s integrated software tools improve the speed, quality, and efficiency for our customers with software development projects. 
So in summary, software had a really terrific quarter, and we gained significant market share across the portfolio; in WebSphere, Information Management, Rational and Tivoli, in Key Branded Middleware, and in total middleware.  Obviously, with this performance, we are taking share from key competitors like Oracle and Microsoft. We delivered 21% profit growth and expanded margins. And we remain on track to deliver about $8 billion of segment profit this year -- that’s up from $7.1 billion in 2008 and up from $2.8 billion in 2000.  So that demonstrates the substantial transformation in IBM’s business model. 
Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up $1.3 billion year to year. This is exceptional performance, in fact, a record level of free cash flow in a third quarter. The increase was driven by higher net income and improved cash from sales cycle working capital, as collections remain strong and inventory low.  These were partially offset by higher retirement-related funding. Through the first three quarters, we generated free cash flow of almost $8 billion, that’s also a record, and a year to year increase of a billion and a half. 
Looking at the uses of cash year to date, we reduced our non-financing debt by over $6 billion, including $4 billion this quarter.  And we also returned $6.5 billion to shareholders; $2.1 billion was in dividends and $4.4 billion in share repurchases. This drove a reduction in average diluted shares of 4% year to year, and we had $4.2 billion remaining from our board authorization. 
Now, let’s turn to the balance sheet where we see the impact of our strong cash performance. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.5 billion, that’s an increase of $1.8 billion from the third quarter of 2008. Total debt was $25.5 billion. Twenty-three billion dollars of debt is in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at seven-to-one.  Two and a half billion dollars is non-financing debt. Our non-financing debt is down from $9.6 billion at year end ’08, and almost $10 billion from a year ago. And it’s down from its peak of almost $12 billion in the middle of  2007 when we completed the accelerated share repurchase.  Our strong cash flow has enabled us to afford this large debt reduction without impacting our cash reserves. So we continue to have a very high degree of financial flexibility.  Non-financing debt-to-cap was 14%, down from 35% in June and 49% at year end. 
The Balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term. 
I’ll start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share performance.  Our improved mix, and ongoing actions to drive productivity yielded significant margin expansion. In fact the benefit from a lower tax rate and share repurchase activity nearly offset the impact of our revenue decline.   And so the real driver was our gross margin expansion and expense productivity, which together contributed $0.39 of earnings per share growth. This quarter, with our earnings per share growth of 18%, we continued our second quarter momentum and improved our revenue performance.   
Our leadership technology combined with our focus on delivering value to our clients resulted in broad-based share gains. In hardware, we took share in System p, System x, blades, disk, tape, and Systems and Technology overall. In software, we took share in WebSphere, Information Management, Tivoli and Rational, and total branded middleware. We continued to expand margin, and delivered strong profit growth through a combination of a higher value mix, globalizing our operations, and driving productivity across the business.   
These transformational changes have reduced our fixed cost base and improved the operational balance point, generating more profit from each dollar of revenue. We generated a lot of cash, paid down $4 billion of debt in the quarter, and ended the quarter with $11.5 billion of cash. We’re using our strong profit and cash flow to drive the investment needed to expand our base of opportunity, organically and through acquisitions.  This month we added to our capabilities with the acquisition of SPSS. 
The strategic transformation of our business has allowed us to deliver strong performance in this environment, but also positions us for the future, with a much better business profile and more competitive cost structure. 
For the full year, we are increasing our expectations for earnings per share to at least $9.85 for the year. That’s an increase of $0.15 since July and double-digit earnings per share growth for the year. And while it’s early to talk about expectations for 2010, with the current view of 2009 we certainly remain well ahead of pace to deliver our 2010 roadmap.   
Now Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks.  Second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.  When we conclude the Q&A, I’ll turn the call back to Mark for some final comments. 
Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Grossman with Thomas Weisel. You may ask your question. 
David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners
Mark, there seem to be several moving pieces in the service business this quarter. GBS I think was down 11% in the third quarter versus down 9% I think in the second quarter against an easier comp and it looks like SO was down about 2% and I think earlier in the year you were hoping it would flatten out in the third quarter and return to growth in the fourth quarter. You know, perhaps the SO results reflect the push-out of bookings into October. However, I’m just wondering -- is GBS continuing to weaken? I think one of your primary competitors recently said that they don’t expect to see sequential growth in their consulting business, at least as defined by revenue per day, until mid-2010. So just curious what’s your thoughts on that and maybe if you could help us better understand what the trends are. 
Mark Loughridge
Okay, I’ll be glad to do that. You know, when you look at the overall GBS performance, a couple of things I’d keep in mind -- first of all, there is variation in what we saw in performance across geographies, so if you look at that signings performance, one of the very encouraging signs that we saw in it was CNSI in North America was in fact up 20%. That’s pretty strong performance and if you look at the geography that I would look at as being kind of leading indicator of a progressive recovery, I would look towards North America. In addition, if you look at application outsourcing, application outsourcing signings globally were up 39%. So both of those to me give us kind of good handle on where we think future performance could drive. 
Now across the services business, I got to add, I think they did a pretty darn good job in the quarter driving profitability and we are very focused on that, still feeling very confident as we close out the year that our services business will achieve $8 billion in profitability, double-digit profit for the year, and I would think we’d be looking at kind of revenue performance in the fourth quarter not dissimilar from what we saw in the third quarter. A lot of good opportunity in our signings base as we go into the fourth and as I said, some early indicators that I think were encouraging, specifically again North America CNSI up 20% and our application outsourcing signings up 39%.

The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford C. Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein
 
Thank you. You referred, Mark, several times to improvement in growth rate in the third quarter relative to the second quarter. I think at constant currency your growth rate overall improved about 2% but your comparison was actually 4 percentage points easier at constant currency. Moreover, when I look to your guidance for Q4, it looks like you are guiding for about 5% EPS growth relative to 13.5% EPS growth in the first three quarters of this year. So the question I guess is do you really believe that corporate technology spending is improving at all? Because it’s not evident from this quarter’s performance relative to last quarter and your guidance, so do you believe corporate technology spending is picking up and/or fully stabilized? And if so, why what appears to be relatively tepid EPS guidance for Q4?
Mark Loughridge
Okay, let me -- that’s a very good question. First of all, let’s talk about the second quarter to third quarter dynamics. First of all, I would say that we had pretty good revenue performance I think in the third quarter. One indicator, we did have quarter to quarter growth and as you know in our business, oftentimes we have seen actually a decline going from second to third because we have large vacation content in our European business. But this quarter we had good quarter to quarter growth of $300 million. In addition, when you look underneath that and you go by geography and you just look at that year to year performance comparing second to third, IBM overall had better performance on a year to year basis, as you pointed out, by 2 points. So if you look at the geographic mix of that, Americas was better by three points, which I think was quite significant. Europe was better by one and Asia-Pacific better by 2, so I did I think see better year to year performance with a lot of share gain, especially in our hardware businesses and our software businesses. 
Now as far as corporate technology spending, I think the results that we are seeing are more indicative of the strength of IBM's offering and our ability to drive value in our offerings to our client base. So I wouldn’t make a comment on technology spending. What we see more broadly I think is some stabilization in the economic environment, and one of the key indicators I think of that stabilization which I would think you would agree with, is credit markets have certainly improved on a year to year basis. You remember last time at this point in time, we were talking about questions like well do you have commercial paper, or do you have a financing business, and we are certainly through those kinds of questions. 
So with that improvement in credit markets, I believe the environment has stabilized. But I do think we had some very good offerings driving performance in the third quarter. 
If you now turn to EPS guidance for Q4, I guess the first point I would make is that we took that guidance up now from $9.70 to $9.85 -- you know, that’s our third increase this year and I think it indicates the confidence we have. Secondly, I would say remember that $9.85, that’s an at least, right? Third, if you just look at that $9.85 roll through and you look at the profit growth that it would imply in the fourth quarter, that profit growth on a PTI basis is really just shy of double-digit performance and if you now say well what does that set up for the year, even at that at least base of business, I mean, we are driving double-digit earnings per share growth in the year on the back of double-digit EPS share growth last year and the year before and on a compounded basis since 2002. 
So I guess my perspective is we have constantly taken this number up, we have a lot of confidence in our offerings and I think we are looking forward to a good year for IBM. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Toni. Operator, can we take the next question, please?

The next question comes from  Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets
Thank you. Mark, I wanted to ask you about the software segment. The PTI margin was up substantially year over year basis and you also mentioned that the legacy software is very profitable but as branded middleware grows against that legacy, how should we be thinking about the profit margins on software? Does it stay at these levels? Can it keep moving higher? If you could just add some color there, please. Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge
I think the encouraging part underneath this, if you look at branded middleware, branded middleware has typically grown much more rapidly at very, very attractive gross profit margins. So as we continue to grow branded middleware as a component of our overall software elements, we should see I think some acceleration in that overall revenue growth at these very attractive margins and we have certainly seen that as we’ve gone through the year in our software business. So as you point out, software profitability was pretty attractive, up 21% -- you know, margins were up 6 points and we see that kind of effectiveness and efficiency continuing because software will continue to be the beneficiary not only of providing mix benefits to the IBM Corporation but they also see the benefit of all the work we are doing on the structural efficiency and our balance point as we continue to work on driving productivity across shared staff and across process efficiencies. And you’ll remember, we really focused on that on the analyst meeting and software plays a big part in that, so I think, or I am quite confident in our software performance. I’ve been pretty impressed with it and as we continue to mix into the software business, software generally on a segment basis has twice the gross profit and twice the net profit, so it’s a good opportunity set for us. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Keith. Let’s take the next question, please.

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital
Mark, you generated some pretty good cash. You only have $2.5 billion in non-financing debt. The debt-to-capital non-financing is down to 14. What do you plan to do with your cash right now? How are you looking at that? I mean, it would seem like you could do -- you could reaccelerate your buy-back and still do the string of pearls acquisitions and given where the stock is after hours, wondering what you were thinking regarding that but also over the long-term, sir. 
Mark Loughridge
Yes, you bet, good question. I mean, as you look at it, I was very impressed with our overall free cash flow performance. I mean, in this kind of an environment, to drive that year to year benefit of $1.3 billion or on a year-to-date basis, $1.5 billion, that’s quite impressive. And a cash balance of $11.5 billion, having paid back $4 billion of debt in the quarter, what does that give us? Boy, that gives us a lot of financial flexibility as we go into the fourth quarter and into 2010 -- financial flexibility to drive investments in the IBM business, financial flexibility to continue this operational cadence on acquisitions which has very strong benefit for us. You know that we just completed the acquisition of FTSS to provide predictive analytics to our business analytics base of business and financial flexibility to continue to repatriate value to our shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends, and dividends which we took up this year by 10% and I think we are one of the few businesses currently to be taking a dividend up in this kind of environment. 
So as I look at it, Ben, a lot of flexibility not only moving into the fourth and 2010 but that will continue to be a strong and powerful element of our roadmap going forward. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Ben. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
The next question comes from Bill Shope with Credit Suisse.
Bill Shope - Credit Suisse
Mark, you guys have demonstrated tremendous growth in margins for the services business throughout the downturn and even in years prior to the downturn but the recent improvement has been most pronounced. Now, your largest competitor here has also shown improvements as well, largely due to integration synergies. But now my question is beyond IBM specific efficiencies that you’ve discussed and created over the years, is there something more structural occurring in the industry that is generating a richer profit profile for all the leading players? And if so, how are customers starting to react to this since in the past, customers have been quick to seize on any margin expansions from vendors and services?
Mark Loughridge
You know, when you look at our performance in margins, you are quite right to point out that the performance from both of our services businesses has been pretty impressive, especially you know, if you look at the GTS side of the business with PTI margins up 3.4 points. Now, underneath that, I can tell you that they continue to drive very strong process efficiencies both on the GTS and the GBS side of the business to deliver better value and better usage of the shared asset content across the IBM Corporation, which we will continue to deliver upon. 
Now I will also say that year-in, year-out, when we did the analyst meeting, when we pointed out that we had a spend take-out of about $3.5 billion for the year, you’ll remember the way we described that spend take-out was a mix of workforce rebalancing, about $2 billion and $1.5 billion of improvements in our balance points through optimizing our shared services content, our shared staff, and our process efficiencies. 
In addition, all of the business units continue to rapidly and aggressively take cost out to deliver that cost benefit back to the customer sets. So as you look at this, the bulk of that margin improvement is stuff unique to the value we are creating and the efficiencies that I think we are creating on global basis with a global business structure. But don’t look at that $3.5 billion and say is that the only cost in spending that we are taking out? The answer is absolutely not. We’re taking even more than that. The services business, when you look at delivery, they took $1 billion out and a lot of that content they deliver straight through to the customer and to a price and price competitiveness. 
Patricia Murphy

The next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen & Company.
Moshe Katri - Cowen & Company
Given some of the things that you are seeing today, are you prepared to make any remarks about corporate spending for 2010? Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge
Well again, if you think back to the question that Toni asked, I wasn’t really making a comment about overall corporate spending. Again, as we look at the economic environment currently and moving into ‘010, it looks like, as I had said earlier, it’s really stabilized. So within an environment of general stability, that’s a big improvement as we go into ‘010 versus what we saw as we went into ’08 and ’09. Now that said, as we look at the opportunity we have, we have a lot of unique opportunities for IBM as we go into 2010. 
First of all, on the hardware base of business, new announcements -- I mean, in 2010 we are going to have a new  Z series. We are going to introduce Power 7 across the P series -- high-end, mid-range and entry level. We’ll do that -- that starts in the first half of ’010 and we’ll have that done by the end of ‘010. 
We’ll have a full year of the new high-end storage that now doubles the speed and efficiency based on the introduction of Power 6.  We’ll have the improved capability in our X series that you saw this quarter picking up 2 points of share growing blades by 25%. That hardware velocity we think really continues against an easier set of compares and helps to propel 2010. 
Additionally, if you look at our longer term outsourcing content and you accrue those deals that fell over the goal line in the first two days of October, that would put our long-term outsourcing signings on a third quarter basis up 16% and a year-to-date up 18%, which is consistent with the first half. So that’s a strong position to be in. 
And then we also have improvements in our backlog that’s now at $134 billion, up $5 billion. Along with that, the real momentum that we see in our software business. So I think we have opportunity and strength unique to the IBM Corporation and as we outlook and our assumptions we’re assuming stability. If in fact you know, the economic environment improved beyond that, we could have upside. But we’re not counting on that as we make our projections as we go to the fourth quarter and 2010. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Moshe. Let’s go to the next question, please.

The next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
Thank you very much. Mark, I was just hoping that you would provide, as you have in past calls, some general color on the fourth quarter pipeline in both the services and the software businesses please. 
Mark Loughridge
Sure. As we look at that pipeline, we do see improvements in the pipeline going from third quarter to fourth quarter and as we evaluate the quality of that pipeline, we think that both our software and our services business should see revenue performance in the fourth quarter similar to what we saw in the third quarter. 
Now also I remember as you look at that, our hardware business revenue performance should actually improve going from third quarter to fourth quarter, and really the ramp in performance that we are looking for going from the third to fourth is delivered predominantly by our software business, where we think we are in a strong position, and our hardware business. 
But we also see, if you take CNSI as an example, we saw some good leading indicators, as I pointed out earlier, with North America signings up 20% and we see an improving pipeline as we go from third quarter to fourth quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Rich. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
The next question comes from Robert Cihra with Caris & Company.
Robert Cihra - Caris & Company 
Thanks very much. I know it’s less of the overall impact increasingly anyway but with the hardware margins and you are saying you should get improvement in Q4, is the year over year decline though that we’ve been seeing, is that just simply a function of mix and that mainframe going down as a percentage of mix? Or is there more to it in terms of whether it’s sort of price pressure or on the other end just less absorption across micro-electronics and that sort of thing? Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge
Well, I mean, if I looked overall on a year-to-date basis on our hardware business, the hardware business has been wrestling with the difficulty we’ve seen in the economic picture and I would put most of that on that kind of a view of the world but as we go into the fourth quarter, remember we’re not just saying we see an improvement in profitability for our hardware business going from third quarter to fourth quarter. We’re looking at it and saying that really that segment based hardware business ought to be growing profitability at double-digits as we go into the fourth. 
So that’s a pretty substantial improvement and I think it indicates the strength we see in the product line and it puts us in a much better posture as we go from fourth quarter to 2010. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Rob. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
The next question comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs
Great, thank you very much. If you look at the services signings and you move the three deals that closed in the first few days of October into Q3, you’ll see a pretty sharp deceleration in outsourcing signings growth in Q4. So how should we think about signings growth over the next few quarters?
Mark Loughridge
Well you know, I think one aspect, and we’ve talked about this a lot in the past, but when you are looking at these long-term signings, they do not evenly distribute across the quarter. I mean, there’s big engagements, a big signings base, they can easily fall across the date line. But you know, as we look at our fourth quarter and our full-year perspective, we’re looking for double-digit growth on our outsourcing signings. 
Now one of the big I think [inaudible] is that how in fact your backlog is doing and I think it is encouraging that as we look at the -- our entry into fourth quarter, our backlog at $134 billion is backed up $5 billion. So good opportunity set in the fourth quarter. We’re looking for double-digit outsourcing performance and if we get that, we’re going to have it certainly for the year and I think when we say on a year-to-date basis that we are performing up 13% through the third quarter or up 18% including those deals that fell over the date line, I think that’s pretty strong momentum that we have. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, David. Operator, let’s take one more question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks very much. Just to follow-up on the services commentary, I wanted to ask about your revenue outlook for services in 2010, given what you know about your pipeline, your recent bookings growth, et cetera, and if that business does grow as these large contracts get layered on to the model, how do you drive margins as these contracts ramp? Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge
Well, we are going to continue to focus on the same elements that we have so far this year on those overall process efficiencies, on lean process management, on globalizing a back-office and staff functions. And you know, one way to look at this, when you kind of do the analysis on the impact of short-term signings versus long-term signings and the momentum in those two, long-term signings do layer in over time but they have been very strong on a to-date basis. 
On short-term signings, one aspect that I would remember is that short-term signings, if you exclude the software support content in that business that’s predominantly associated with software performance, it’s not part of short-term signings, really the profitability in short-term signings is about 10% of IBM's performance. And so I wouldn’t over-weight short-term signings as an element of our business equation going into the fourth quarter, nor into 2010. And we feel pretty confident in our capabilities to continue to drive margins. 
Again, going back to the analyst day that we had, we pointed out that even if you just took the actions that we had in place this year, another $400 million of savings would flow into 2010 and in addition, we are clearly targeting to continue to take out about $1 billion of back office shared service spend across our business, both in that absolute spend and in process efficiencies, which has gone I think quite well.  
So let me now take a moment to close out the call. As you know, I think IBM did have another great quarter. Like the second quarter, EPS was up 18% but this time we had better revenue performance and share gains. Really I think this is led by strength in software -- profit up 21% and up 18% year-to-date, capitalizing on the strength of solutions like business analytics to drive share gains and branded middleware. Our full-year base as we look forward, we should enjoy double-digit profit achievement and we are looking to achieve that $8 billion objective that we set for software and I’d remind you that that is up from $7.1 billion last year and up from $2.8 billion in the year 2000, so it’s one of the best indicators of the substantial transformation that we’ve seen in our business. 
When you turn to services, we are going to continue to [raise] our margin performance and double-digit growth in outsourcing signings that we’ve seen year-to-date. With backlog of $134 billion, up $5 billion, it puts us in good position going into the fourth and like software, we expect to achieve $8 billion of full-year profit, again up double-digits on a year to year basis. 
But I think most distinct, when you look at our hardware business, with strong share performance in the third quarter, with  P up 5 points of share -- that’s quite significant -- X up 2 points of share, we think that we are going to turn around in the fourth quarter generating double-digit profit growth with new products going into 2010, a new Z series, Power 7 now across the P series line by the end of the year to continue this momentum. 
On a free cash flow base, year-to-date we’ve generated almost $8 billion, up $1.5 billion year to year. So in a stable to improvement environment, at the current spot rates, IBM expects to return to revenue growth at actual rates in the fourth quarter. And we’ve increased our view of 2009 to at last $9.85 of EPS, which is the third upward revision this year and we were in my opinion without a doubt well ahead of pace to our 2010 roadmap. 
So one again, thanks for joining the call and with that, as always, it’s back to work.

Now, I’ll turn the call over to Mark Loughridge. 
Mark Loughridge 

Thank you for joining us today. This quarter we delivered $2.32 of earnings per share, up 18% year to year. This is a record level of EPS for a first, second or third quarter, adjusting for stock splits. We generated over $4 billion of cash from operations, and ended the quarter with $12.5 billion of cash on hand. And we returned another $2.4 billion to shareholders, with $700 million in dividends and $1.7 billion of share repurchases. 
With this powerful performance, we now expect to generate at least $9.70 of earnings per share for the year, up $0.50 from our previous view of at least $9.20. 
This is the result of the strategic transformation of our business. Our ongoing shift to higher value areas has positioned us to better meet clients’ needs. This quarter, our strategic outsourcing signings were up 38% at constant currency, and our key branded middleware revenue, now 58% of software, grew 5% at constant currency.   
Our strategic acquisitions continue to contribute to our higher value capabilities. This quarter Cognos, Telelogic, ILOG and storage solutions XIV and Diligent all showed very strong results. 
But as you will see, margins are fueling our profit growth.  I’ll discuss how our transformation is driving this but it is the shift to higher value, globally integrating our business, and our ongoing productivity initiatives that led to significant margin improvement.  We expanded our pre-tax margin by 4 points.  That’s our best margin improvement in almost four years, when we divested our PC business. 
This quarter, our strategy and business model together delivered high levels of profit in a tough economic environment. A key point here is that our model delivers improved margins, even when revenue growth is a headwind. So when revenue growth becomes a tailwind, the operating leverage we’ve created will really come through and continue to drive our earnings. 
We’re using this financial strength to invest in new areas that will help drive the next growth cycle for our clients, areas like Smarter Planet, business analytics and cloud computing. I’ll come back to that later in the discussion. 
Looking at our income statement for the quarter, our revenue was $23.3 billion, down 13% as reported, and 7% at constant currency. Despite the revenue decline, we improved both pre-tax and net income by 12%, with outstanding margin performance. 
Gross margin expanded over 2 points, due to improving margin in services and software, and the mix to higher value businesses such as software. Our expense was better by 19% year to year, driven by actions we’ve taken to continue to transform and globalize the business, focused expense management, and the benefit of a stronger dollar. 
Pre-tax margin was up over 4 points year to year to 18.3%.  This is IBM’s highest PTI margin in 10 years in a first, second or third quarter. And IBM’s total net income margin was up 3 points. With a lower share count from our ongoing share repurchase activity, bottom line we improved earnings per share by 18% year to year to $2.32. 
The actions to develop this margin improvement didn’t just happen.  We have been working on this strategy for a decade so let me give you some background that will provide perspective on our second quarter results.  
Looking at IBM’s performance over the last several years, we have consistently generated strong profit and cash growth since 2002. You can see the impact of the last recession following the dot.com bubble, where a sales decline and the resulting charges impacted our margins and our earnings. 
Since then, we have been executing our strategy: shifting to higher value segments; globally integrating the company; driving efficiency and productivity, and investing to capture future growth. So now, IBM is a fundamentally different company with a stronger portfolio of offerings and a more efficient cost structure, enabled by ongoing process improvements.  And so now in the current recession, we’re able to improve margin and profit even with declining sales. 
So it’s pretty obvious that the driver of our profit growth over the last several years has been margin expansion. If you go back to the 90’s, our gross margin was declining, with increasing pressure from commoditizing products.  This was a massive headwind for us,   which impacted our ability to reinvest in the business.  
Since then, we exited commoditizing businesses, including HDD’s in 2002, PCs in 2005, and printers in 2007, which represent nearly $15 billion of annual revenue.   In that same time, we acquired over 100 companies for $20 billion.  This has clearly accelerated our shift to higher value capabilities. 
This disciplined focus on shifting our business mix and our business model has driven this turnaround in margins. You can see we’ve been consistently improving our margin every year and with that strong performance, instead of the constantly eroding expense-to-revenue relationship, we’ve been able to grow our rate of investment. 
In 2008, we had the highest gross margin since 1992.  Our margin in the first half of ’09 is already higher than the full year 2008 and that’s without the seasonally-strong fourth quarter. 
So we’ve made a lot of progress on margins but we still have headroom.  In the May investor briefing, we showed you how our PTI margin compared to the S&P 500 and the tech universe. We’ve included that same chart in the supplementals, updated for our second quarter margin. 
The shift in our business mix is even more apparent on a profit basis.  This chart lays out the sum of the segments, which of course is a little different than total IBM. From 2000 to 2008, the profit from software and services combined almost doubled. In 2009, we’re continuing to drive solid profit growth in software and services.  In fact, we expect both software and services PTI to grow double-digits this year. As you can see, software now grows from $2.8 billion in 2000 to about $8 billion this year and services from $4.5 billion to approximately $8 billion. 
So again in 2009, we expect ongoing momentum in our software and services businesses. 
Now with that perspective, I’ll start to get into the details of the quarter, starting with revenue. I want to start with the industry view, to give you a feel not just for the current performance by sector but also the kinds of projects we’re working on to help our clients create more value and become more productive. 
Total sector revenue was down 13% as reported and 6% at constant currency. Public sector was the fastest growing sector for the fourth consecutive quarter; revenue was up 7% at constant currency, with constant currency growth in all industries.  
Clients in the education industry are investing in IT infrastructure, and our revenue was up nearly 30% at constant currency.  Cloud computing is a way to reduce costs and extend access to educational resources.  By designing and deploying wireless and converged networks, we are equipping schools to better deal with their IT requirements.  
A few days ago, we announced that the largest school district in Alabama is using IBM analytics technology to more effectively measure student performance and adjust programs to deliver smarter education services.  Customizable dashboards provide up-to-the-minute data to monitor the entire lifecycle of each student, including attendance, grades, and special education requirements. 
In healthcare, where our revenue was up 11% at constant currency, IBM is working with clients around the world to create smarter health care systems. We’re getting real traction in solutions to create accessible electronic health records, and are using business analytics to drive efficiency and healthcare quality.  
Now let me comment on the other sectors. Communications sector revenue was down 4% at constant currency. Our clients continue to invest in infrastructure and transformation projects with short-term payback. We’re leading in the creation of Smart Grids with our Intelligent Utility Network solution, with five of the largest smart metering deployments in North America. 
In Financial Services, where revenue was down 7% at constant currency, we continue to help clients manage costs, capital requirements, and risk and compliance.  Over 250 banks worldwide use IBM’s financial services data models to help address financial risk, customer insight and financial reporting. This is a strong base on which to build next generation risk analysis.  We’re bringing together our leading capabilities in analytics and in supercomputing to address some of this sector’s major challenges.  
I’ll mention two specific areas.  We’re working with the leading financial regulatory and supervisory bodies worldwide to explore how a new generation of smarter systems could not only enable effective intra-day market supervision, but also provide an early warning system for global systemic risk management.  We’re also working with several of the world's largest financial services companies to help them streamline regulatory and compliance reporting, refine enterprise management reporting and improve decision-making across all their operations. These are great offerings for our clients in this environment. 
Distribution sector remains challenging, especially in retail and travel & transportation industries. Total sector revenue was down 11% at constant currency. Even in this environment, the growth markets provide good near term opportunities in these industries.  For example, we are working with nearly 40 of the top rail systems globally to determine new ways to work together to build out the modern smart rail systems of the 21st century. And as you would expect, with an 18% decline at constant currency, industrial sector remains the most challenging as clients continue to deal with the global downturn in consumer spending.  
Turning to our geographic revenue, similar to the first quarter, performance was fairly consistent across the geographies. As always, I’ll focus my comments on the constant currency growth. Globally, the major markets declined 8%,as customers remain focused on saving cost and conserving capital. In the growth markets, which is 18% of IBM’s geographic revenue, we again delivered 8 points of growth above the major markets.   
While the BRIC countries declined overall, the performance and prospects differ by country. For example, India grew modestly, with strong growth in services, mitigated by weak transaction performance.  And while China declined from a very strong second quarter of 08, we had good growth in second and third tier cities.  We expect to return to double-digit constant currency growth in China in the third quarter. 
Now, I’ll move on to the segment view for revenue and gross margin. Our revenue growth was impacted by currency and the economic environment, but our broad business capabilities, our ability to deliver value to customers and our significant base of recurring revenues came through with solid performance in software. Software was led by key branded middleware where we gained share. 
As you would expect in this environment, our transaction businesses were most challenged, specifically hardware and consulting, where we were impacted by a slowdown in shorter-term projects. This makes our gross margin expansion of 2.3 points even more impressive.  
As part of our ongoing transformation, we continue to shift to higher value, the most obvious driver being the mix to software, which contributed about half a point of improvement. Within each segment we’re driving a shift to higher value as well, for example, away from the lower margin OEM content toward the higher margin, higher value labor-based content within our Integrated Technology Services.  
Our ongoing initiatives to improve our services productivity through global delivery capabilities, a more variable workforce, and better utilization also contribute to the improvement. These initiatives and dozens of others are all part of the transformation, and have driven consistent improvement in our gross margin over time. In fact, this is the 19th quarter of the last 20 that we’ve expanded our gross margin. 
Now let’s take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and investment profile. This quarter, our total expense and other income was down 19%.  Operational expense improved 10 points year to year. Currency drove 10 points of decline, and reflects both translation of non-dollar based expenses, and the impact of the hedging programs that flow to expense. 
We’ve been executing an operational plan to increase efficiency and drive productivity across the business, all part of our transformation to higher value areas and to globally integrate the enterprise.  The implications to our business are important; they reduce our cost structure, and make it more variable.  A lower level of fixed cost improves our operational balance point, so with improved operating leverage, every dollar of revenue yields more profit. 
This quarter our recent initiatives, such as the globalization of our support functions and rebalancing our workforce, contributed to our margin improvement.  For the full year we now expect $3.5 billion of cost and expense savings from these initiatives. 
At the same time, we were able to leverage our strong margins to continue a significant level of reinvestment.  We are investing in capabilities that will differentiate IBM in the future and accelerate the development of new market opportunities.  For example, in support of Smarter Planet solutions, 25% of our research projects are dedicated to these initiatives which take IT well beyond its traditional data center boundaries.  This requires both unique technical capabilities and skills in areas like healthcare, transportation, telecommunications and utility systems.   
We’ve invested almost $8 billion in strategic acquisitions since 2005 to build business analytics capabilities. This provides the foundation for the creation of a business analytics practice, and we’ve redeployed and hired 4,000 resources to address this opportunity. Later this month we will announce a new integrated business analytics system designed to accelerate the deployment of advanced analytics capabilities leveraging IBM hardware, software and services.   
We have also been making substantial investments to build our cloud capabilities.   In mid-June, we announced the IBM Smart Business cloud portfolio with solutions to help clients deploy their own clouds targeting specific workloads, as well as new services delivered over the IBM cloud. We will add to this portfolio in the Fall. Now, we initiated these targeted investments to position IBM for continued growth and improved margin mix. 
To close out the discussion on spending, as always I’ll lay out the roadmap items that had significant year-to-year impacts to our profit. We had a year-to-year impact of $195 million from investment transactions.  This was driven by a charge of almost $120 million related to an investment in a joint venture. This charge also increased our effective tax rate in the quarter by 70 basis points. 
We absorbed over $300 million of cost and expense for our retirement-related plans, which was down $70 million year to year. We continue to expect about $1.4 billion of cost and expense for the year. 
Within other income and expense, interest income was down almost $60 million, reflecting the current interest rate environment. And as you would expect, we have a year-to-year benefit from our hedge of cash flow programs, reflected in other income and expense, SG&A, and cost of goods sold. This mitigates the impact of the stronger dollar throughout the income statement. The year-to-year benefit is about $400 million in total, with more than half in other income and expense. 
So now let’s turn to our segment margins. This is a snapshot of both gross and pre-tax margins by segment. With gross margin up 2.3 points, and expense reduction of 19%,we delivered a 4 point improvement in pre-tax margins. And as you can see, we increased our pretax margin in every segment, with particular strength in GTS, up over 5 points; software, up over 8 points; and global financing up almost 9 points. More importantly, we’re operating at a very high level of profitability, with an 18.3% pretax margin. I’ll get into more detail on margins in the segment discussions.  
So let’s start with services. Our combined services business did a tremendous job driving profitability and margin expansion this quarter. In what continues to be a challenging economic environment, total pre-tax profit was up 23% on revenue that was down 12% as reported and 4% at constant currency. Combined gross margins were up 2.7 points, we’ve improved gross margin in 17 of the past 18 quarters. And we delivered $2.0 billion in pre-tax profit, up 4.1 points year to year. 
Signings were $14 billion at actual rates, down 5% but up 3% at constant currency. We signed 17 deals larger than $100 million.  Signings in our outsourcing businesses were $8 billion, up 3% at actual currency rates and up 12% at constant currency.   This includes the third consecutive quarter of double-digit signings growth in strategic outsourcing. 
Backlog at the end of the quarter was an estimated $132 billion. Backlog was up $5 billion since March, and flat quarter to quarter at constant currency. 
Now I’ll turn to the key drivers of performance in the two services segments. In global technology services, signings were up 15% at constant currency and within that, outsourcing signings were up 24% at constant currency. Strategic outsourcing signings were particularly strong, up 38% at constant currency, growing in all major geographies.  Within that, S.O. in North America was up over 90% at constant currency.  We are providing innovative solutions to help clients drive efficiency and cost savings.  We expect our strong value proposition to continue to drive outsourcing signings in the second half.  
Global technology services revenue in the quarter was $9.1 billion, down 2% at constant currency. Although growth in outsourcing signings provides a solid book of business, revenue in the quarter was impacted by reduced volumes in our existing client base.  
In integrated technology services, we are continuing to drive our product portfolio toward higher value, higher margin offerings, and away from OEM content. This quarter, ITS revenue performance largely reflected signings declines in the OEM offerings that support capital intensive product roll-outs. 
Now turning to profit, the GTS team executed across the portfolio to drive powerful profit performance. Global technology services pretax profit was up 41%,and margin improved 5.4 points year to year to 14.9%.  This was the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit pretax profit growth, and again we had gross margin expansion in all lines of business. This sustained margin performance is a result of the transformation we’ve undertaken in GTS. 
We continue to make structural changes to service delivery.  Our initiatives around standardization, global integration, and automation have resulted in a more flexible and productive organization, operating with improved efficiency.  These changes helped drive performance this quarter.  Not only did we execute significant cost and expense actions, we also continued to improve quality and customer satisfaction. And that is quite an achievement. 
Turning to global business services, signings were down 14% at constant currency and within that, consulting and systems integration signings were down 8% at constant currency. 
Revenue was down 15% as reported and down 9% at constant currency off of a very strong quarter last year. In spite of that revenue performance, GBS improved pretax margin by 1.5 points year to year. 
Our revenue performance reflects lower signings in consulting, where we had a more pronounced decline in smaller, faster-yielding contracts.  Starting last year, clients were focused on solutions that help them to save cost and drive greater efficiency. During the first half of this year, despite this continued focus we have seen an increase in required approvals and the delay of more discretionary projects.  That said, we continued to grow systems integration revenue and for total GBS we had strength in public sector, and our growth markets all at constant currency.   
With global business services pretax profit down 4%, margin improved 1.5 points year to year to 13.3%. We were able to do this because of the transformation we’ve undertaken over the past several years. We have built a global infrastructure and framework that supports a very dynamic resource deployment model. It drives improved utilization and service delivery. Our professional workforce tools provide skills and availability at the tip of your finger; we can then shift people to where the work is, optimizing the mix of IBM employees and subcontractors around the globe. Overall we have a much more flexible and dynamic model than we’ve ever had. 
This quarter, the key drivers of this margin performance were: cost and expense savings from our recent workforce rebalancing actions, lower subcontractor spending, and higher utilization in our global delivery centers.  We expect to continue to see the benefits from these actions in the second half of the year as well. 
Turning to software, revenue of $5.2 billion was down 7% year to year, and flat at constant currency. We had terrific profit performance, with segment pretax income up 24% year to year, and pretax margin up 8 points to 32%. Our software business continued to perform well in this economic environment, led by key branded middleware that grew 5% at constant currency and gained share. 
Once again, customers purchased software that delivers fast payback as well as transformational projects with strong return on investment. This quarter branded middleware accounted for 58% of our total software revenue, up 3 points from second quarter of 2008.  Other than our seasonally-strong fourth quarter, this is the highest percentage of key branded middleware ever. 
Now let me give you some insight into the brands. WebSphere products grew 8%,or 17% at constant currency, and gained share. Business Process Management, Commerce, and Datapower product segments all grew double digits at constant currency. 
ILOG, which helps to drive business rules management to the analytics space, did very well again this quarter, and contributed to WebSphere growth. ILOG middleware grew over 50% year to year from its pre-acquisition levels. 
Information Management software declined 4%,but grew 4% at constant currency. Cognos, which was acquired in January of 2008, grew over 20% at actual, and 30% at constant currency. We also had strong growth in our Information Integration and Master Data Management products which customers utilize to transform their enterprise data for competitive advantage.  Our information management software is a key driver of our new business analytics and optimization service line.   
Tivoli software was down 2%, but up 6% at constant currency, and we gained share. Within that, Tivoli’s storage products grew 16%, or 25% at constant currency. Driving this growth are the hot, higher value areas of virtualization, de-duplication, and open disk storage, which together grew over 60%.  We built the latter two capabilities through our Diligent and XIV acquisitions. 
Lotus software declined 14%, or 8% at constant currency versus a difficult compare last year.  Lotus was impacted by a softening in demand driven by customer consolidations and downsizing. 
Rational revenue declined 2%, but was up 5% at constant currency and gained market share. Customers leveraged the productivity and return on investment enabled by IBM’s suite of software tools. Rational products accelerate and simplify collaboration across the software development process. Telelogic products grew over 40% and extended our reach into the systems development market space. 
The breadth of our software portfolio, the strong recurring revenue and disciplined expense management combined to deliver 24% profit growth in a challenging economic environment.  
Systems and technology revenue of $3.9 billion was down 26% year to year, 22% at constant currency. We believe this performance is in line with the industry.  Now remember at this point in the first quarter we also estimated in line performance, but after our competitors reported their results, based on industry reports we actually gained a point of share in the first quarter. 
A few second quarter highlights: in Converged System p, once again, we gained share.  We significantly increased the number of UNIX competitive displacements to well over 100 in the quarter. Within that, we more than doubled the number of Sun competitive displacements from the first quarter. For the first half of the year, this amounts to nearly a $0.25 billion in sales from UNIX competitive take-outs. In System x, we anticipate that we gained share for the second consecutive quarter. 
Our storage products held share. We had over 65 high end tape competitive displacements in the second quarter and strong performance in our storage acquisitions XIV and Diligent -- which also have significant software content. 
Focusing on the brands: System z revenue declined 39% year to year and 35% at constant currency as we wrapped around on a very strong compare. Major markets were weak as we experienced a lengthening of the customer decision cycle for hardware commitments.  Our growth markets were up 17% at constant currency. 
MIPS declined 20% in the quarter, but were up 4% on a two-year compounded growth rate as we simply had a very tough compare in the second quarter of 2008, which was up 34%. 
Profitability improved as gross profit margin expanded by 3 points year to year due to a higher percentage of microcode upgrades. Later this month, we will announce new System z workloads that target growing market segments such as Business Applications, Data Warehousing, and Security.   These new custom offerings that we’ll call System z Solution Editions, integrate a portfolio of enterprise software and security products with the System z platform.  They will be competitively positioned to attract new workloads to System z , and will expand the platform’s value proposition to both new and existing customers. 
Converged System p declined 13% year to year and 8% at constant currency. We gained share in the UNIX market for the fifth consecutive quarter.  Share gains have been the most pronounced in the mid-range and high-end of our product line, where our success in driving consolidation and virtualization has delivered proven results. As I mentioned earlier, we doubled the number of competitive displacements from the first quarter.   
Gross profit margin also improved 2 points year to year through solid cost management. System x server revenue declined 22% year to year, or 17% at constant currency, and we gained share for the second consecutive quarter.  We believe the improved sales execution and strong performance from our new products will enable us to continue to gain market share through the second half. 
Blades were down 6% year to year. IBM was the first to deliver blades with the new x86 processors, and we benefited from strong customer adoption of this new technology. We believe we gained share in blades overall. We also expanded margins in System x. 
Storage revenue declined 20% year to year, 15% at constant currency, and we expect to hold share despite double-digit declines in both disk and tape. Our storage acquisitions are ramping well.  XIV added over 100 new storage customers in the second quarter.  Since we purchased the company, we’ve added over 200 new customers who had not purchased IBM open storage in the last two years. 
The value in storage continues to shift to software and, as I mentioned during our software discussion, we had very strong performance in this space.   
Now let me close my comments on systems and technology by saying that with our new capabilities and continued share gains, we expect to improve revenue performance starting in the third quarter, and deliver year to year profit growth in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to cash flow, we generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, down about $260 million year to year. The decline was driven by less cash from sales cycle working capital, a higher level of workforce rebalancing payments, and higher retirement-related funding requirements, mitigated by the impact of lower net tax payments. Even with that, free cash flow was up $200 million in the first half to $4.5 billion. 
With this strong and recurring free cash flow, we were able to return $4.8 billion to shareholders in the first half. We paid $1.4 billion in dividends -- this includes a 10% increase approved by the board of directors in April. We’ve tripled our dividend over the last five years. We spent $3.4 billion in the first half on share repurchases.  This drove a reduction in average diluted shares of 4.5% year to year, and we have $5.1 billion remaining from our board authorization. 
So now let’s turn to the balance sheet. We ended the half with a cash balance of $12.5 billion, that’s an increase of $200 million from the end of last quarter.  More than two-thirds of our cash is in the U.S. Total debt was $29.4 billion.  This is down $1.6 billion from March, and down $4.5 billion since the end of 2008 -- $3 billion of the first half decrease went to reduce our non-global financing debt.   
Non-GF debt-to-cap was 35%, down from 42% at the end of the first quarter and 49% at year end. With $22.8 billion of debt, our Global Financing business is leveraged at 6.9-to-1. The balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term. 
I’ll start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share performance. Our improved mix and ongoing actions to drive productivity yielded significant margin expansion. In fact, expense productivity and tax nearly offset the impact of our revenue decline and so the real driver was our gross margin expansion, contributing $0.27 of EPS growth. 
And with our ongoing share repurchase activity, we delivered 18% growth in earnings per share. This performance is the result of the strategic transformation of our business.  
Since the end of the dot.com bubble, we’ve been moving out of commoditizing businesses, while investing in higher value areas.  This better positions us to meet client needs, and drives a more profitable mix. We’ve also been globally integrating our company to improve productivity and efficiency. These transformational changes to our business have reduced our fixed cost base and improved the operational balance point, generating more profit from each dollar of revenue. 
We’re using our strong profit and cash base to drive the significant investment needed to expand our base of opportunity, both organically, and through acquisitions. This quarter we had great acquisition performance, with Cognos’ business analytics solutions, Telelogic’s tools, and ILOG’s business integration capabilities. We’re investing in areas like our Smarter Planet solutions, business analytics and new compute models such as cloud computing. They are contributing to results today but obviously have even greater potential going forward. 
In addition to supporting investments in growth initiatives and acquisitions, our great cash position and strong cash flow also allow us to return capital to shareholders. In the first half we spent $4.8 billion on share repurchases and dividends, and again increased our dividend. 
Bottom line, the changes to the company have allowed us to deliver strong performance in a tough environment.  But more importantly, the transformation has positioned us to come out even stronger when the economy improves, with tremendous operating leverage and a much better business profile as we continue to mix to higher value businesses. 
So with that as a base, we are increasing our expectations for earnings per share to at least $9.70 for the year. It’ll be driven by our ongoing margin improvement, just as it was in the first half. And we’ll continue to execute our strategy and maintain our focus on delivering profit and cash over the longer term, as we are well ahead of pace for our 2010 roadmap. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q-and-A, I’d like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. Second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I’ll turn the call back to Mark for final comments. 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein
Thank you. Mark, you wrapped up by saying that you felt the company had tremendous operating leverage as the economy picked up. If I simply look at what happened between Q1 and Q2, total company revenues went up $1.5 billion, your pretax income went up $1.1 billion, so you got $0.74 in incremental profit for every dollar in revenue that you generated sequentially from Q1 to Q2. If I look back at your average over the previous six years between 02 and ’08, you got $0.34, or 34% in terms of operating leverage. 
So the question is how should investors think about a marginal contribution in operating leverage going forward? And if it’s not the 70% that we saw in Q1 to Q2, what happened in Q1 to Q2 that was so unique that led to that very high leverage ratio?
Mark Loughridge 

Well, that’s a great question, Toni. The point I was making on the operating leverage going forward, I think in this quarter it was a pretty strong statement to be able to improve our margin so substantially when currency and revenue was a headwind, and my point going forward as you look at fourth quarter, currency will now be a tailwind and I would argue that we go into the fourth quarter and 2010, we should have a better economy and a stronger revenue platform and with that, operating leverage should really show through. 
Now to your point on the operating leverage that we generated going first quarter to second quarter, a lot of that operating leverage was in fact structural operating leverage that should continue. On the other hand, the only point that I think deserves some caution, this is still a tough economic environment. We have not seen the stimulus packages flow through. We’re still watching our overall price points -- now price points held very, very well in the second quarter and the bulk of our initiatives all dropped to the bottom line. 
But outside of that, if you just look at the raw leverage, we should have a very strong position, as you point out, sustaining and going into this second half. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Richard Gardner from Citigroup.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
Thank you. I was just hoping, Mark, you could give us a sense of, assuming current spot rates, what’s going to happen to the $400 million benefit that you received from hedging in the current quarter as we progress throughout the rest of the year? How do we think about how that number evolves going into Q3 and Q4?
Mark Loughridge 

Okay. I think the way that I look at it, and there’s a lot of dynamics underneath it so I don’t think you can take my statement and extrapolate it on a uniform basis but if you look at the overall impact of currency in the quarter, it was about a net zero, so if you looked at the impact that we had on gross profit, the offsetting impact on world trade expenses and the hedge, that year to year impact from currency was about a net zero impact. 
Now as you go forward and currency starts to reverse itself, one would argue that it’s going to be helped in the fourth quarter of 3 to 4 points and that will generate improved operating performance in our gross margin line. Now, there will be some mitigation of that in the hedge that would offset some of that impact but right now, just look at the raw performance in the second quarter between expense and the hedge, the year to year effect of currency was just about zero on our overall performance. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Rich. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Our next question comes from  Chris Whitmore from Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks very much. Mark, reported revenue ex currency was down about 7% in the quarter. I think that missed most people’s expectations and last quarter you talked about accelerating growth, particularly in the services as we move through the year with potentially growing services revenue in Q4. Can you give us an update as to what you expect in terms of constant currency revenue and its progression over the next couple of quarters?
Mark Loughridge 

Sure. Let’s start off by recognizing that this second quarter was really the toughest compare we had for the year and we all recognize it. We had real powerful revenue performance last year across the product line. So we knew that this was going to be our toughest compares going into the second half. 
Let’s talk about what we see in the second half now and I’ll do this by line of business. And with that, let’s start with hardware. So hardware was down double-digits in the quarter and as we look forward, we expect that rate of decline to halve as we go into the third quarter and halve again as we go into the fourth quarter. And we have a number of offerings, and we talked about the benefit we thought we could get from these new work load offerings and v Series, ongoing share performance in t Series and x Series. 
So we are pretty confident that we’ve got a very good hardware play going forward and in fact, it’s that recovery in the overall rate, along with the margin improvement that we expect that should generate positive profit growth from hardware as we go into the fourth quarter. So I think that’s a pretty start. 
Software, I mean, we just had a terrific quarter here on a software base and we expect going forward to see about the same revenue performance in the second half from software. We had very good performance out of our acquisitions and we have really strong margin performance. So we expect to have double-digit profit growth in our software business for a year. 
And last, if you look at services, we had a little more difficulty in the year in the areas of the business that were more discretionary, in the GBS area. But if you look at the strength that we have had in our longer term signings, that should compel our S.O. business as we go forward. I mean, we have had three very good quarters in a row on long-term signings growth. I mean, look at S.O. this quarter, up 38%. And we expect in our outsourcing business again to have double-digit signings growth as we go into the third quarter. 
So you put all that together and I think we are going to see S.O. come back to growth in the fourth quarter. 
So I think with all of those things, that gives us a strong base to go into the second half and I think frankly all of this gives a good platform in 09 as we prepare for 2010. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Chris. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Our next question comes from  Ben Reitzes from Barclays Capital.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital
Thanks a lot. The question is with regard to signings and leverage -- Mark, at your analyst day, I think you said you thought long-term signings would be up double-digit. I wasn’t sure whether that was constant currency or not but on an actual currency basis, they didn’t make the double-digit but I was just wondering also, when you combine that with the actual currency on the short-term signings, they were down 14. I was just wondering actually if signings were below expectations, actually as you went throughout the quarter and what that does to leverage in the back half, you know, considering that we don’t have the $400 million in hedging benefit too per quarter? I was just wondering how those dynamics play out. 
Mark Loughridge 

Well, when we look at that, we always make those statements on a constant currency basis. We had very good signings performance this year so at a constant currency, we had growth in total signings, we had growth in long-term signings. You know, our outsourcing signings of 12% globally, S.O. up 38% -- I mean, you can’t look at that and not be impressed with that level of signings performance. 
And I think on your currency points, if you look at overall backlog, though backlog was flat on a quarter to quarter basis, it was in fact up $5 billion due to currency, so we are facing and moving into a period where actually currency is going to start to help that backlog performance. 
But our statement, my statement that I made at analyst day was based on constant currency performance and I think this has been very, very strong performance in the quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Ben. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Our next question comes from David Bailey from Goldman Sachs.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on what drove six points of sequential PTI improvement in software, and how sustainable that is?
Mark Loughridge 

Well, the PTI improvement that we had in software, a lot of that is driven by all of the structural improvements that we’ve been driving for our business, and those structural advantages are going and improvements in productivity are going to continue as we go into the second half of the year. 
So as you look at these results in the second quarter, there was nothing in these results that I would call a unique one-time advantage. So as I look at it going into the second half, those structural elements coming off of all of the initiatives that we have driven to improve our processes and our management of our overhead structures and our shared staff, those will continue as we go into the back half of the year. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Our next question comes from  Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets
Thanks for the question. I want to ask a similar question on GTS -- you had a 10% revenue decline and yet your pretax dollars were up over 40%. What were the -- could you talk a little bit about the specific key drivers there and how you anticipate the pretax margin, which is now 15%, how should we be thinking about that moving forward? Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge 

Well, you know, the GTS performance, I would put that in a longer term framework. I mean, they have gone, PTI, double-digits for the eight consecutive quarters and again, a very powerful performance, up 41%, in the second quarter. That is really, really driven by the margin improvements that was executed across all of the lines of business. And I think it’s appropriate to re-emphasize, when we have put margin as a key element of our 2010 roadmap, that emphasis on margin along with revenue performance, share repurchase, acquisition performance, that’s embedded in all of our segment performance metrics and strategies. And I think GTS just did a great job in the quarter capitalizing that. 
You know, S.O., this is really driven by delivery. They have advanced tools and automation, new process techniques that they are driving, hardware and software optimization across that -- a lot of it we regard as our intellectual property that differentiates us from the competition. 
ITS, they too are driving towards a more profitable labor based book of business away from OEM content. In business transformation, it’s really a function of deal selectivity and delivery performance and I think they did a great job. 
And you know, even in maintenance -- even in maintenance, you know, looking at adjusting for Info Print, they drove very good OEM business adoption within the maintenance business. Frankly, if you adjust for Info Print, maintenance was up 1% year to year, very strong margins. 
So that margin strategy is part of our ongoing work to transform the business. It’s part of each of the business units objectives and plans and I think it really showed through in the second quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Keith. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz from J.P. Morgan.
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan
Thank you. Good afternoon. Mark, you mentioned in your comments about incremental workload [inaudible] introduced here shortly. Could you maybe give us some context in terms of how the workload engines in the mainframe business the last couple of years have boosted the annuity block in your software business? Has that helped leverage and can we see it be even more leverage with these new blocks coming out?
Mark Loughridge 

Yeah, I mean, when you look at the z Series platform, that new workload approach is really to draw a new customer content and new customer adoption into the platform, and we’ve been quite happy with our new workload performance over time. 
I think what is interesting about this now is it really does expand the aperture of the workload opportunities that we apply that approach to, so that’s why we are going to implement this new data warehouse offerings that enables real-time business analytics, consistent with our emphasis on business analytics. The enterprise disaster recovery solution enabling multi-location platforms for disaster recovery. Enterprise security hubs, the WebSphere application server, the enhanced SAP solutions -- I mean, you put all five of those together, it substantially increases the aperture of opportunities that we now apply that new workload content to, and it has actually worked very, very well and we are quite optimistic about it going into the second half. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Let’s take the next question, please. 
Operator
Our next question comes from  Bill Shope from Credit Suisse.
Bill Shope - Credit Suisse
Thanks, guys. Maybe I missed this earlier in the call but can you give us some color on the short-term signings performance, particularly on a constant currency basis? And how we should think about that going into the second half?
Mark Loughridge 

Well, you know, if we look at short-term signings on a constant currency basis, it was down 7% and as I said, most of that was driven by the impact as customers look at the more discretionary elements of their budget and that hit us in the more discretionary elements of our short-term offerings. 
So as we move forward, there’s still going to be that budget pressure on the customer side of the house but on the other hand, we also would think that as the stimulus starts to roll out through the second half, and that affects the economy, that the customer adoption of those and the discretionary should improve. 
Now that said, we did not [inaudible] -- as we built our view of the second half. We did not consider that. We said at best it stays about the same level moving into the second half. In fact, we kind of built this assuming that the GVS platform was about the same regular performance of second half as the first half, though it would be an improving bet going from third quarter to fourth quarter, so we did not go on the potential economic upside as the stimulus packages hit but I think that is a real opportunity for us.

Thank you, Bill. Let’s go to the next question, please.

Our next question comes from Scott Craig from Merrill Lynch.
Scott Craig - Merrill Lynch
Good afternoon. Mark, you mentioned a $3.5 billion cost and expense savings this year, which I think is a little bit up from when you went over it on the analyst day, so first, where did that incremental $500 million come from? And then secondly, does it still -- how does it roll out over the back part of the year? How much have you already kind of put through the P&L so far? Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge 

Okay. Very good question -- you know, when we looked at that and described the $3 billion in the analyst day, we described that in really two different categories -- you know, what was the yield off of the work force rebalancing and at that time, we said it was about $2 billion and we still look at that to be about $2 billion, so that’s quite consistent. 
The other element that we identified was the content from all of the work that we are doing on our integrated support functions and our integrated support processes that we manage on a global basis and at that time, we thought we’d get about $0.5 billion advantage from each of those or $1 billion in total for the year.  
What’s happened is we went through the second quarter, all of the work on those initiatives actually developed a much higher rate of yield than we anticipated, so now against that $1 billion, we now see closer to $1.5 billion as we go through the year. So that’s where the extra $0.5 billion kind of came on the integrated support functions and integrated support processes and all that work we are doing on process management on a global basis. 
Now, if you look at the way that $3.5 billion rolls out, we’ve got about $0.5 billion in the first quarter, about $1 billion in the second quarter, so that leaves another $2 billion to roll out through the second half of the year. And given that it’s kind of structural in nature, I would look at that kind of evenly distributed across that second half. 
Scott Craig - Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thank you. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Scott. Operator, can we take one last question, please. 
Operator
Our next question comes from David Grossman from Thomas Weisel.
David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners
Thanks very much. Mark, given the upward revision to your 2009 outlook, how should we think about the 2010 range? You know, given that you reiterated again that you are well ahead of pace. And can you remind us what the key assumptions are underlying your 2010 outlook?
Mark Loughridge 

Sure, I’d be happy to go through that. I mean, as you’ll see, we have from our perspective, increasing the at least number from 920 to 970, we’ve got a very strong base as we look at 2009 and much of that advantage will flow in through to 2010 as well. 
So I think we are very well-positioned for 2010. We gave that a range of 10 to 11. I think it’s a little hard not to say we are well ahead of pace when we are now looking at least 970 per year. That was a long range forecast that we built and that forecast, if you remember the elements was built on kind of the contribution we should get from revenue, the contribution from margin, from share repurchase, our acquisitions, our big investment elements. 
So as I look at 2010, I look at it and say one, well ahead of pace; two, a very solid base; and structural improvements in 2009 that will roll through to 2010 and like every year, we will update our view of 2010 in January. But right now, I feel pretty well-positioned.  
So with that, one, I want to thank you all for joining our call today and just give me a moment to wrap up here. 
I would close really by saying that IBM had a very strong quarter and it really was driven by our ongoing transformation. I think you can see in the analysis that we’ve been shifting towards higher value businesses and driving productivity and efficiency across the enterprise. And it’s really a result of our business model, where we improved our margin quite significantly. 
We see this continuing with double-digit profit growth across both software and services for the full year. And I think if you go to that bar chart that we included in the exhibit, I personally think there’s no better indication of the transformation that we’ve been driving than the change in profit contribution from the segments from 2000 to 2009, with software going from $2.8 billion of segment profitability in 2000 to about $8 billion in 2009 -- that is real transformation progress. And services likewise, going from $4.5 billion in 2000 to almost $8 billion in 2009, the combination is about $16 billion. 
In addition, we see hardware stabilizing and returning to profit growth in the fourth quarter, on the back of that decline that we saw in our hardware business in the second quarter halving as we go into the third quarter and halving again as we go into the fourth quarter. This strong profit and cash flow continues to allow us to make strategic investments that will fuel new growth and margin expansion. We see this with our strong performance in XIV and Diligent key acquisitions that were part of our storage software growth, which is up 25%, as well as Cognos and ILOG, which both had very, very good quarters and are the foundation investments in business analytics where we have invested $8 billion to capture this great opportunity. I don’t think we just look at that suite of 12 acquisitions that we knitted together with our own organic investments and our research contribution -- that didn’t just happen this year. We’ve been building that since 2005. 
And so I think that when the economy turns, we have real operating leverage to capitalize on this growth in 2010 and that’s why we increased our guidance by $0.50 for the year to at least $9.70, which puts us well ahead of pace for our 2010 roadmap objective of $10 to $11. 
So once again, I want to thank you for joining the call and now, as always, it’s back to work.

Mark Loughridge
Thank you for joining us today. This quarter we delivered $1.70 of earnings per share, which was up 4% year-to-year. This positions us well to achieve our objective of at least $9.20 of earnings per share for the year. We generated $1 billion of free cash flow, up $450 million. We ended the quarter with over $12 billion of cash on hand and we reduced total debt by $3 billion. We returned another $2.5 billion to shareholders with $700 million in dividends and $1.8 billion of share repurchases.
We have done a lot of work over the last decade to transform the company, shifting
to higher value areas, globalizing our business and constantly working to improve efficiency. I will give you a few examples of how the changes that we have made have positioned us to deliver this performance in a challenging economic environment.
First, with a focus on higher value offerings and strong services capabilities, we can adapt our offerings to deliver what clients are looking for. Today, clients remained focused on trying to save costs and conserve capital. Our services signings reflect our ability to meet these needs. Total signings were up 10% at constant currency with 27% constant currency growth in our longer-term categories.
Second, the actions we have taken have dramatically shifted the mix of our business and our profit model has less dependence on hardware which is more vulnerable to economic conditions. In fact, this quarter effectively all of our pre-tax profit came from software, services and financing. The annuity nature of these businesses provides a solid base of revenue, profit and cash.
Third, we have been investing to capture the opportunity in the growth markets. Our constant currency revenue growth in these markets remained about eight points higher than in major markets.
Finally, We have had an ongoing focus on driving productivity in all parts of the business, from sales efficiency to supply chain management to service delivery to global support functions. The result of this work is to reduce our fixed cost base and therefore improve the operational balance points. Bottom line, we have built a more resilient business model and one that generates more profit from each dollar of revenue.
IBM’s transformation positions us well for 2009 but more importantly, our model provides the cash we need to invest in new areas that will help drive the next growth cycle for our clients. In addition to our growth markets investments, we have three other key initiatives.
First, is our Smarter Planet strategy where governments, utilities and businesses are applying intelligence to the key processes of the world. This allows clients to create more value and long term economic growth from their infrastructure investments. The second new opportunity is Business Analytics which leverages our broad capabilities to optimize our clients’ business performance by applying analytics to their business processes.
We are already working on advanced analytics projects with a diverse set of clients including TD Bank, MTN South Africa, The New York State Department of Tax and The Sentinel Group. Third is Cloud Computing, an emerging model for delivering and consuming IT enabled services.
Each of these three opportunities requires enterprise software, deep industry process knowledge and solution integration capabilities where IBM is very strong. We will leverage our cash position to be opportunistic to accelerate our progress in the areas we believe will fuel growth and competitive differentiation in the future. We will spend more time on these initiatives in our investor briefing in the middle of May but for now, I will get back to our first quarter performance.
Looking at our income statement for the quarter, our revenue was $21.7 billion, down 11% as reported, and 4% at constant currency. As I mentioned, we had outstanding margin performance. Gross margin expanded almost two points driven by improving margin in services and software and the mix to higher value businesses such as software.
Our expense was better by 9%, with continued focus on expense management and the benefit from a stronger dollar. Pre-tax margin expanded 1.3 points and net income margin expanded 1.1 points. Finally our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a lower share count. So bottom line, we delivered $1.70 of earnings per share up 4% year-to-year.
So let me get into the first quarter details, starting with revenue by segment.
Our revenue performance was impacted by currency and the economic environment but also reflects our broad business capabilities and the contribution of our annuity content. Service revenue was driven by a strong annuity base, though it was impacted by a slowdown in small, faster yielding projects and declines in longer-term signings in 2008.
Software revenue growth was driven by demand for mission critical software. Systems and Technology performance reflects the challenges that transaction based business are facing today. Within the segment, our UNIX servers performed well. In Global Financing, excluding currency impacts, both financing revenue and the sales of used equipment were essentially flat.
Our total geographic revenue was down 11% as reported and 3% at constant currency with consistent performance across the geographies. As always, I will focus my comments on the constant currency growth.
Globally, the major markets declined 4%. Our growth markets unit grew eight points faster, up 4% and we continue to out perform in these countries. Revenue from the growth markets represented 17% of IBM’s geographic revenue in the quarter. As these countries build out their public and private infrastructures in this environment they are also focused on cost savings. We have also been delivering these capabilities to clients in the major markets and so we are well-positioned to address these needs.
Our growth markets performance reflects the diversity of the regions. While some of these areas are clearly more challenging like Central and Eastern Europe and a few of the smaller Asia Pacific countries, several of the larger countries are showing resiliency and good growth. For example, India grew 12% and China grew 11%.
In India, we again were named the Number One IT service provider in the domestic market. In China, in addition to continued strong demand for our banking infrastructure offerings, our Smarter Planet solutions are gaining traction with clients. Across all of the growth markets we will continue to target our investments to profitable growth areas and capture opportunities in these strategically important markets.
When you look at revenue performance by sector, I think you will find it is what you would expect in the current environment. Public sector was the fastest growing sector again this quarter with growth at constant currency in all industries. In addition to solid revenue growth, we also had good signings in the public sector, up almost 50% worldwide at constant currency and over 200% in the U.S.
Government and education clients at the federal level are focusing on investments to drive job creation while state and local agencies are looking for cost reductions through infrastructure and process transformation. Healthcare clients are focused on cost reductions with strong demand for outsourcing and transformational offerings.
Now I will briefly comment on the other sectors.
For Financial Services clients, IBM’s value proposition around cost reduction and risk and compliance remain priorities. Market consolidation is driving demand for integration projects. In Communications, clients are also looking for operating efficiencies and cost reduction and IBM’s offerings on Intelligent Utility Network put IBM in a leadership position for Smart Grid technology.
While the Distribution sector remains challenging in the major markets, in the growth markets we have strong double-digit growth at constant currency in all industries as infrastructure for expansion drives investment. Industrial sector remains the most challenging in all industries as these clients are conserving cash and reducing capital spending to position for recovery and drive long term viability.
Now, I will move on to a discussion on expense. This quarter, our total expense and other income was down 9%. Currency drove nine points of decline year-to-year and reflects both translation of non-dollar based expenses and the impact of the hedging programs that flow to expense. We estimate that acquisitions contributed about three points of growth and our operational expense improved four points year-to-year. We have been executing an operational plan to increase efficiency and drive productivity across the business. Over the last several quarters I have highlighted a number of initiatives we are working on to reduce our structure and make it more variable.
This lower level of fixed cost improves our balance point so every dollar of revenue yields more profit. The changes we have made allowed us to deliver margin improvement this quarter in a tough environment, but we will also see additional benefit as we go forward as our current actions start to yield. I will comment on three actions we have taken that impact this quarter but also substantially improve our position going forward.
First, in March we completed the transaction to outsource our internal logistics process to Geodis and we booked a gain of $298 million net of a related charge for real estate. In our call in January I mentioned that we would complete the outsourcing arrangement in the first quarter and that the gain would be relatively offset by a higher level of restructuring in the first part of the year.
So second, this quarter our workforce rebalancing charges were about $265 million, most of which was for our services business. We expect to spend between $300-400 million globally for the full year which is a typical level of restructuring for us and as we said a lot of this was skewed to the first part of the year. Since most of this is behind us, the benefits of these actions will start to come through in the second quarter.
Third, we took additional specific reserves against our accounts receivable balance. This contributed to a year-to-year increase in AR provisions of about $100 million. Our reserve coverage on accounts receivable is now 2.4%, up 80 basis points from a year ago and up 40 basis points from year end. We believe the increase in reserves is appropriate given the current economic environment.
A few other items that I will mention had year-to-year impact to our profit. We had a year-to-year impact of $80 million from investment transactions primarily driven by the sale of Lenovo shares in the first quarter of last year. Within other income and expense, interest income was down about $110 million reflecting the current interest rate environment. As you would expect, we have a year-to-year benefit from our hedge of cash flow programs reflected in other income and expense, SG&A and cost of goods sold. The year-to-year benefit is about $380 million in total with about half in other income and expense. Of course this mitigates the impact of the stronger dollar throughout the income statement.
Finally, though it is not a significant year-to-year impact, we absorbed about $430 million of cost and expense for our retirement related plans in the quarter. We now expect about $1.4 billion of cost and expense for the year, about flat year-to-year. That is an improvement from our previous view.
Before getting into the segments, I will quickly show you our margin performance by segment. This is the 18th quarter of the last 19 that we have expanded our gross margin with about ¾ of this quarter’s improvement coming from our better margins in services and software and the balance from a mix shift to our software business. With the expense performance I just took you through, we expanded total pre-tax margin by 1.3 points. I will get into some of the drivers within the segment discussion but bottom line, our margins reflect the shift of our business to higher value areas and our constant focus on improving productivity.
So now I will turn to our segment performance, starting with services.
Our two Global Services segments delivered strong signings and profit margin performance this quarter. Total signings were up 10% at constant currency and total longer-term signings were up 27% at constant currency. Total pre-tax margin was up 1.6 points driving our services profit growth. We understood the challenges we would face as we entered 2009 and we continued to execute on cost and expense actions consistent with the transformation of our business model. We will see the benefit from our first quarter actions in margin improvement for the remainder of the year.
The combined segments delivered $13.2 billion of revenue in the quarter, down 10% as reported and down 2% at constant currency. Combined gross margins were up 2.2 points and we delivered $1.6 billion in pre-tax profit at a margin of 11.8%. Signings were $12.5 billion at actual currency rates, down 1% but up 10% at constant currency. Signings in our longer-term outsourcing businesses were $7 billion, up 14% at actual currency rates and up 27% at constant currency.
Shorter-terms signings, which include Consulting and Systems Integration and Integrated Technology Services, were $5.5 billion, down 14% at actual rates and 5% at constant currency. We signed 16 deals larger than $100 million and that is on top of the 24 deals larger than $100 million that we signed in the fourth quarter last year.
Backlog at the end of the quarter was an estimated $126 billion. As a reminder, we are now reporting backlog at actual currency rates. Excluding the impact of currency, backlog was flat quarter-to-quarter and up $1 billion year-to-year.
Now I will turn to the key drivers of performance in the two services segments.
Global Technology Services executed very well in a challenging environment. Total signings were up 13% at constant currency and longer-term outsourcing signings were up 22% at constant currency. Pre-tax profit was up 12% and margin was up 2.3 points. Revenue was down 10% as reported and down 1% at constant currency.
Strategic Outsourcing revenue was down 9% as reported and down 1% at constant currency. We had a strong quarter in SO signings, up 23% at constant currency. This was led by good growth in North America and the growth markets. Within North America, Canada was particularly strong. We have talked in the past about the compelling value proposition Strategic Outsourcing provides to our clients as it gives them a lower cost base and better variability over the contract period.
We have had two strong quarters of SO signings and expect double-digit growth again in the second quarter. With this signings performance we expect revenue to return to growth in the second half of the year. Integrated Technology Services revenue was down 7% as reported and up 1% at constant currency. Integrated Technology Services signings, or the shorter-term GTS signings, were down 7% at constant currency.
Although we continue to get good results in efficiency plays such as optimization and managed services, we are seeing declines in large end-user roll outs with high OEM capital content. We have been shifting our portfolio to higher value offerings and away from OEM content. So while this quarter we had lower signings and revenue the mix away from OEM gives us better gross profit performance.
Global Technology Services pre-tax profit was up 12% and margin improved 2.3 points year-to-year to 12.1%. This was the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit, pre-tax profit growth and again we had gross margin expansion in all lines of business. Margin improvements were driven by a combination of greater mix to higher value offerings, particularly in Integrated Technology Services where the key plays are becoming a larger portion of the portfolio and cost and expense management driven by our initiatives in standardization, global integration and improved efficiency.
The work we have done to improve efficiency not only drives our margin improvement but gives us the flexibility and capability needed to quickly address rapidly changing environments and really positions us for when the economy turns.
Turning to Global Business Services, total signings were up 6% at constant currency. Pre-tax profit was down 10% or about $60 million year-to-year with margin essentially flat. Revenue was down 10% as reported and down 4% at constant currency. Looking at revenue from a geographic perspective, we had good results in the growth markets where revenue growth accelerated from the second half of 2008. However, in the major markets revenue was impacted by lower longer-term outsourcing signings last year and a deferral of some projects.
Turning to GBS signings, our longer-term application outsourcing signings were up almost 50% at constant currency with good growth in both the major and growth markets.  Within the major markets, clients continue to be primarily motivated by cost savings opportunities but in the growth markets we still see a balance between cost savings and infrastructure build-out initiatives.
In our shorter-term category of Consulting and Systems Integration, signings were down 4% at constant currency. Within that, declines in the very small contracts, the ones that impact near-term revenue yield, were most pronounced. From a sector perspective, we had good growth in Public and Communications sectors but not enough to offset declines in Industrial and General Business. We still see over 70% of the deals coming from cost savings and efficiency offerings.
We will continue to evolve and adapt our offerings to meet the changing needs of our clients. As an example, we just announced the launch of our new Business Analytics and Optimization service line. This practice will draw on the full breadth of IBM’s capabilities including deep industry expertise, research and software capabilities. We think this is going to have an immediate impact on our clients’ ability to improve speed and quality of business decisions.
As we look forward, we will see the benefits of our recent workforce rebalancing actions over the remainder of the year. We have got the management and delivery structure in place in both services segments to continue to expand margin. In fact, we expect double-digit profit growth in the second quarter.
Moving on to software, the $4.5 billion of revenue was down 6% year-to-year and up 2% at constant currency. Software pre-tax income was up 5% and we expanded pre-tax margin by almost three points. This was a solid quarter in a tough economic environment. Customers continue to purchase mission critical software to run their businesses and demand was strong for software that delivers fast returns on investment while adoption of software for transformational projects slowed and non-essential purchases were heavily scrutinized.
Let me give you some insight into our branded middleware performance, which was up 5% at constant currency. WebSphere products grew 5%, or 14% at constant currency and gained share. Application Servers allow customers to build, run and integrate their mission critical business applications. They were up 1%, or 10% at constant currency. iLog, which was acquired in December, did very well this quarter and helped drive our WebSphere Business Integration segment to double-digit growth. Information Management software declined 8%, or up 1% at constant currency.
Distributed Relational Database continued to perform well, up 2% and double-digit at constant currency. Going forward, our information management software is a key component of our new Business Analytics and Optimization service line. Tivoli software was down 1%, up 8% at constant currency and we gained share. We had strong constant currency growth in all three of Tivoli’s product sets: Security, systems management, and storage software.
Customers utilized Tivoli software to improve control and automation of their infrastructure. This lowers costs and drives efficiency. Storage management software grew 3%, or 13% at constant currency, as customers optimized their storage infrastructure. Lotus was down 12%, but Rational had a very strong quarter and gained share with revenue growth of 9%, or 19% at constant currency.
This performance was driven by strength in our Performance and Security testing offerings which deliver near-term return on investment benefits to our customers. Across all software brands, we have strong recurring revenue. In fact, annuity content represents 2/3 of our software business. This provides a good base of profit and helped our software business to deliver solid performance in this tough environment.
Systems and Technology revenue of $3.2 billion was down 23% year-to-year, or 18% at constant currency. We continued to have strength in the high end of our servers driven by virtualization, increased efficiency and good returns on investment. First quarter was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit MIPS growth on mainframe servers and we had double-digit revenue growth in the high-end of POWER servers.
This quarter our systems business held share. Focusing on the brands, System z revenue declined 19% year-to-year, or 12% at constant currency, while MIPS grew 18%. MIPS from specialty engines were up nearly 20%, driven by over 50% growth in Linux MIPS. Our global reach was clearly an advantage. System z revenue grew 37% in our growth markets, which is up 60% at constant currency. Major markets were weak, particularly in Europe as we wrapped around on a strong compare. Converged System P was down 2% but up 5% at constant currency, gaining 4 points of share. Revenue from our high end converged System P continued to be very strong. Revenue was up 35%. We had 62 UNIX competitive displacements this quarter with half of the transactions over $1 million.
System x server revenue declined 27% year-to-year. The demand for x86 solutions continues to soften as customers virtualize workloads and consolidate onto more efficient platforms. Storage revenue declined 20% year-to-year, with double-digit declines in both disk and tape. Our tape performance was in line with the market. Keep in mind these storage results reflect the hardware performance only which is a subset of our broader storage solutions. But more of the value of the storage solution is shifting to software and services and as I mentioned, our Tivoli storage software had a very good quarter. Overall, Systems and Technology results reflect the challenge of this economic environment.
Turning to IBM’s cash performance, we generated $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up $450 million year-to-year. The year-to-year improvement was driven by lower capital expenditures. We also had improved sales cycle working capital offset by a higher level of pension funding for our non-U.S. plans.
Looking at the uses of cash, we reduced debt by $3 billion and we also returned nearly $2.5 billion to our shareholders. $700 million of the shareholder return was through dividends and $1.8 billion was share repurchase. We bought back 22 million shares in the quarter and our average diluted shares were down 4%. At the end of March, we had $3.7 billion remaining from our last Board authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of nearly $12.3 billion with 2/3 of our cash in the U.S. The remaining asset decline was driven by normal seasonal decline in global financing assets and a stronger dollar.
Turning to debt, as I mentioned earlier we reduced debt by $3 billion in the first quarter. We have $5.8 billion of term debt maturities to go this year and we are comfortable with that level given our cash balance, continued cash generation and experience in the capital markets. We ended the quarter with commercial paper of about $800 million, which is up slightly from year end but still very low as compared to history. Our experience in the CP markets remains positive and we have substantial flexibility in the market. Of our $31 billion of total debt at the end of the quarter, $23 billion supports our global financing segment leveraged at 7:1. Once again we have put some information on our global financing business in the supplemental charts.
You will see that 60% of this portfolio is investment grade and while our reserves have increased, consistent with the economic environment, this business still provides a very strong 28% return on equity. I would take that any day. Our remaining debt, the non-financing debt was $7.6 billion, down $2 billion from year end and non-financing debt-to-cap was 42%. Our strong cash flow and significant cash position allow us to continue to invest and deploy capital to where we see the best long term opportunities.
Now I will start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share growth. This chart demonstrates that our first quarter results are consistent with the profile we laid out in January. We had a decline in revenue at actual rates which impacted EPS growth by $0.19. Our improved mix and ongoing actions to drive productivity yielded a significant amount of margin expansion which resulted in relatively flat pre-tax profit and with our ongoing share repurchase activity we delivered 4% growth in earnings per share.
We are executing a plan that is right for this environment and keeps us well positioned for the future. We have been transforming our business for a decade, shifting to higher value areas, globalizing our operations and adapting our offerings to deliver value to our clients. As we saw the environment deteriorate we increased our focus on cost reduction and operational efficiencies to improve our balance point. All of this positioned us to deliver strong profit and cash flow in this challenging environment and also come out stronger when the economy starts to improve.
Our strong financial position gives us investment flexibility, so we are very focused on the future. We see a real opportunity in Smarter Planet initiatives, business analytics and new compute models such as cloud computing as well as our ongoing focus to capture the opportunity in the growth markets. Our great cash position and strong cash flow allow us to be opportunistic in our investments and deploy capital to where we see the best long term returns whether that be our growth initiatives, acquisitions or returning value to shareholders.
So now with one quarter of 2009 behind us we continue to expect earnings per share of at least $9.20 for the year. It will come more from margin improvement, just as it did in the first quarter and we will continue to execute our strategy and maintain our focus on delivering profit and cash over the longer term. Though it is early in 2009 we remain ahead of pace for our 2010 roadmap.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I would like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark’s prepared remarks. Second, I would ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I will turn the call back to Mark for some final remarks.

To hit the $9.20 on lower revenues it implies you are going to see a fairly substantial increase in year-over-year and pre-tax margin. So should we think of this new level as a level that IBM can sustain if internal growth accelerates in an improving economy and is it that margin strength that underlies your statement that you are ahead of your 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 per share?
Mark Loughridge
Let me give some color behind that. First of all, as you pointed out there was very strong margin performance in the quarter and certainly margin carried the day in these results. Why do we feel confident? First of all, to start the year out with such a strong margin performance bodes well for the balance of the year to begin with.
Secondly, I would add that we did a lot to improve our own structural position. As I pointed out in my last call, the structural actions we took in the fourth quarter improved our spend base in 2009 by $1 billion. If you look at the actions we took in 2008 it improved our spend base by $1.5 billion. If you look at the actions we took in the first quarter, they will improve our spend base by another $0.5 billion, so now we are up to $2 billion and if you look at all the ongoing productivity efficiency initiatives we are driving that adds another $1 billion. So we are now up to $3 billion of spend base improvement year-over-year that we believe should drop to the bottom line.
Now it is also important as you look at this to realize the bulk of these actions are behind us and the bulk of the benefit is in front of us. So we finished most of the work here. Certainly in the U.S. but a lot of the benefit we see in front of us now coming off a very strong margin performance in the first quarter to begin with. So I think we have a strong action plan, a strong base of business and it even makes us more confident in our statement that we should be able to achieve at least $9.20 for 2009.
I would also agree with your last point, from my perspective we are well ahead of pace on our roadmap to 2010.

The next question comes from  Toni Sacconaghi – Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi – Sanford Bernstein
I would like you to elaborate on the thinking behind your statement that you are well ahead of pace for your 2010 roadmap. You said ahead of pace just in response to that last question and you said well ahead of pace. If I take the mid point of your range for 2010 at $10.50 that implies earnings growth of over 14% for 2010 versus 2009 or significant upside for your 9.8 estimates for this year. Could you elaborate on what you mean by ahead of pace and where that conviction is coming from?
Mark Loughridge 
By ahead of pace I am just talking about the compound growth rate in EPS starting in 2006. If you look at that, we have been growing on that compounded basis for that period through 2009 at pretty good pace of double-digit EPS. Given that range of $10-11, off even the minimum point of $9.20 we only need another $0.80 so it would be less than our cumulative pace today. I’m just saying if you look at the balance we have to achieve we have certainly done a good job of outpacing that so far.
Secondly, I will say as we go in to next year remember by the time we get to the back half of the year you will see some of the actions we have taken improving our overall revenue performance. We will now have had three quarters of double-digit SO signings performance that should improve our position as we go into the back half of the year. You will also see the effusion of this global stimulus which is now well over $5 trillion and the addressable portion for IBM is going to be almost $3 trillion which I think will substantially airlift overall spend patterns in the back half of the year as we go into 2010.
So again just to answer your question by ahead of pace if you look at our compound growth rate of EPS from 2006 to 2009 that is a growth rate of 15% and to me based on what we have yet to achieve that puts us well ahead of pace.

The next question comes from David Bailey – Goldman Sachs.
David Bailey – Goldman Sachs
What gives you the confidence you are going to see revenue growth in services in the second half given the weakness in short-term signings that you are seeing now particularly in the small, faster turn engagements?
Mark Loughridge 
I was talking about our overall outsourcing performance. When we look at it, first of all SO signings grew 23% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter we have had another growth of 23%. As I look into the second quarter we see another quarter of double-digit growth in our outsourcing businesses. I think that is going to help propel our longer term businesses as we go into the second half of the year. So off of this first half base I think third quarter for SO should be roughly flat. We should see growth as we go into the second half of the year.
All of that in addition to the substantial margin performance we have seen and the spend efficiencies that we see ahead of us, putting all those together I feel pretty confident about our position.

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes – Barclays Capital.
Ben Reitzes – Barclays Capital
I can’t believe it hasn’t been asked yet, so I will go ahead. Everybody on this call believes you are within a whisker of acquiring Sun Microsystems and obviously we saw the announcement today. Do you have any reaction to that? Would you just mind discussing IBM’s acquisition strategy in this environment where we are consolidating and what you are looking to do long-term with your business if in fact that is impacting you at all or maybe it is just a good time to reiterate what IBM is doing so people focus on that?
Mark Loughridge
I think that is a very fair question. First of all I’m not going to comment on the particulars here but we run a very disciplined process. We look at a lot of things but when we run a disciplined process we get good results. If you look at the specific performance in this space, our P series business picked up four points of share in the quarter. The high end of our business was up 35%. 62 enterprise customers migrated to POWER systems platform in the first quarter alone so it is a very strong base of performance. As far as your question about the combination, Oracle and Sun have been partnering for two decades. What is the result? The result is we have picked up 14 points of share since 2000 and now have 32 points. As I look at this and ask myself what has really changed I think nothing. We have been competing with Sun. We know Oracle inside out. They now have the same address and the same mailbox but we are talking about the same team we have been competing against for some time and winning on the field.
As far as acquisitions are concerned we have a very strong base. Our cash is well over $12 billion. We generate substantial free cash flow and we have a lot of flexibility as we go into the balance of 2009 to spend on our internal investments, our own dividends and share buyback program and a substantial opportunity that we see in the market place.
Remember that since 2000 we have done over 100 acquisitions and spent $20 billion and those have yielded substantial benefit to IBM largely as a result of our strong and very disciplined process.
Operator
The next question comes from Chris Whitmore – Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore – Deutsche Bank
Getting back to organic growth I am curious about what is implied in your guidance of at least $9.20 per share. I think previously you talked about holding organic growth x currency growth flat. Do you still expect that target? If not, what is the new target?
Mark Loughridge 
As you know we don’t give revenue guidance. We give our view of EPS. As I look at our view of EPS on an at least $9.20 basis for the year again I feel quite confident in that because even at more modest revenue performance not even flat on a year-over-year basis we feel quite confident about this given all the spend efficiencies, margin efficiencies and the value that we are delivering to our customers especially in the areas of the business where we think we can continue to take cost out of their systems and help them conserve cash and manage their business equation to help transform their businesses.
So, I don’t think we are giving an update on revenue today. What I do want to do is firmly reaffirm our view that we should be able to achieve at least $9.20 for the year and if anything I feel more confident about that today than I did a quarter ago.
Operator
The next question comes from Richard Gardner – Citigroup.
Richard Gardner – Citigroup
Mark you mentioned $1 billion in additional expense reductions coming I believe you said this year. Can you give us a sense of what exactly that encompasses and what types of areas you see the opportunity in? Also if you could just briefly address why the pension expense view changed for the full year?
Mark Loughridge 
If you look at just to recap I see $3 billion of spending improvements on a year-over-year basis, $2 billion of that from the structural actions we have taken in 2008 in the first quarter which the benefit is largely ahead of us and we see another $1 billion from all of the work we have done on our integrated support functions. This has been an overall structural level of productivity that we have been driving for years now. This is just a continuation of that. We will see that not only this year but we will see that into next year as well. So I clearly see an additional $3 billion to buttress our margin performance as we go through the year.
Then as far as pension expense it is simply a function of the overall change in headcount. Of course it is dynamic. This isn’t a big change. It is $100 million and we will keep you updated as we go through the year.
Operator
The next question comes from Keith Bachman – Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman – Bank of Montreal
I was wondering if you could offer up some views on free cash flow, you suggested $9.20 or greater in 2009 on a net income basis or EPS basis and your cash flow is fairly healthy in the first quarter. I was just wondering if you could provide some views on free cash flow including some comments on the CapEx side?
Mark Loughridge 
I feel pretty confident in our free cash flow performance as we go through the year much like expense. We have also been fairly tough minded about our capital expense structure and I think we will have good performance on that CapEx base as we go through the year. I think we will continue to have good cash from ops resulting from our strong margin performance and I would also add if you look at this other element underneath it, DSO has also performed very, very well again in the first quarter.
We are working on all those elements of cash flow and as I look forward I think we should have a pretty good year on that base as well.
Keith Bachman – Bank of Montreal
Just to push you, pretty good performance, does that mean growth in free cash flow?
Mark Loughridge 
Yes.
Operator
The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan.
Mark Moskowitz – JP Morgan
Kind of along the lines of that last question in terms of cash flow power, you mentioned during the call that you have about a 2/3 annuity stream in the software. Can you help us understand how much of that 2/3 is up for renewal this year and of the renewals that have come up anything in terms of re-scoping or are you having a greater leverage with your customer because of your service delivery improvements or your overall software stack? Any color there would be greatly appreciated.
Mark Loughridge 
I think if you look at our software performance and you kind of break it down by the elements of the brand performance I don’t think I would break it down into how much is up for renewal or not up for renewal or the scope. I would go down by the overall business element. So first of all, if you look at our overall performance in our WebSphere content we were up 14% with very strong performance. If you look at our performance in our Tivoli content we are up 8%. Underneath that 8% our storage software is up 13%.
If you look at our overall tools content we are up 19%. I feel pretty confident in that overall performance. I don’t think it is going to be characterized so much by how much is up for renewal and I think we have a good base of business as we go forward. A lot of that as we look at those individual elements is a function of how much value we are able to generate for our customers and I think we have shown some pretty good performance in the first quarter.

The next question comes from Peter Misek – Canaccord Adams.
Peter Misek – Canaccord Adams
I had a question on servers and storage, on the servers and storage side can you elaborate what kind of competitive plans you have to deal with the entry of Cisco into the market especially on the server side? Just walking through obviously the performance there was impacted by macro events. What actions do you think you can take there to help improve things in the second half?
Mark Loughridge 
I’m not going to comment specifically on what Cisco’s plans are. This is a pretty competitive space so you have to get your lift pass, go to the top and we will see you at the bottom of the hill here. As far as our plans, we are going to continue to drive for real value creation and if you look at our performance at the high end I think it backs that up. Our P series again was up 5%. Our high end P series was up 35%. We took four points of share in the quarter. We migrated 62 customers. Our z series content MIPS are up 18%. Specialty MIPS up 19%. Linux MIPS up 50%. Z series in the growth markets was up 60%.
I think we are going to continue to run our play. Our play in this kind of arena favors the efficiency of these higher end server platforms. You can utilize the z series to 100% of its capacity. A P series you can utilize to 50-70% of capacity and that compares with an x series which is typically at 20% or less. So that is going to be our play as we go through the year.
Operator
The next question comes from  Katie Huberty – Morgan Stanley.
Katie Huberty – Morgan Stanley
Can you characterize the tone of business exiting the first quarter and specifically did you see any signs of demand improvement or deterioration in large deals or the transactional based revenue streams in the month of March?
Mark Loughridge 
I think what you can really see is how important in this environment it is to be able to generate and listen to your customer’s challenges to improve their costs, improve their productivity to help them deal with risk and compliance to drive solutions that improve their cash position. If you look at the elements of our solutions that have satisfied those needs that is a big component in the strength we have had in our SO signings, in the first quarter of what we see going into the second quarter and so those are very powerful.
One area that I think is kind of emblematic of that, if you look at the Financial Services sector, an area that has been under a lot of pressure as we all know, the overall record performance for FSS compared to the balance of IBM was on par to the balance of our business but if you look at the signings performance in FSS, short-term signings were up 7% for the [sixth] consecutive quarter while long-term signings in FSS were up 50%.
Why is that? Because we are able to partner with our clients and help them solve their business problems in this challenging environment and we see that as an ongoing thing. We also see that as a larger proportion of the demand environment even in the growth markets. So in addition to the infrastructure build up priorities that we saw, we also see them now focused on that ability to partner with them and solve their business problems.
So let me say a couple of things in closing. I think IBM performed well in this very difficult environment. We saw a clear benefit of our transformation towards higher value software and services. Our software revenue grew and we continued to drive double-digit services signings and we have expanded margins significantly, a play that we have been running for some time now. As a result, we grew earnings and free cash flow. We remain on target for our goal of at least $9.20 EPS for 2009 and if anything I feel more confident in that objective.
As I pointed out in the discussion with Tony, based on our ability so far even at $9.20 the generally 15% compounded EPS growth since 2006, I would say we are ahead of pace on our 2010 roadmap.
On the spend side we are very disciplined in managing our costs. Much of this restructuring activity was front end loaded in the year as I said in our last call. We have that largely behind us especially in the U.S. The benefit is largely ahead of us. So we will realize that positive expense savings throughout the rest of the year. Perhaps the most important part of IBM model is our foundation builds on high value capabilities. So even in this uncertain environment we will continue to invest heavily in R&D to strengthen our business, we are committed to leveraging our strong cash position to take advantage of these opportunities and we will fund investments that will accelerate our initiatives like Smarter Planet, Business Analytics and Optimization and Cloud Computing that will help drive the next cycle of growth and productivity for our clients.
Thank you very much for the call today. We hope to see you at our May investor meeting. For now, as always it is back to work.

Mark Loughridge
Thank you for joining us today. This was a very strong quarter. At the bottom line, we delivered $3.28 of earnings per share, up over 17% year to year. This was driven by terrific margin performance, with pre-tax margin up 2.5 points year to year. By business, Global Technology Services was up over four points; Global Business Services was up 3.6 points to a record level; and Software was up over four points. And this was on software revenue growth of 9% at constant currency, driven by sales execution, and growth in mission critical production software. And services signed $17.2 billion at actual rates. Within that, Strategic Outsourcing signings were up 20%, with North America up 44%. And we had solid short-term signings in Global Business Services, up 4% at constant currency.
We had good cash performance, and ended the year in a very strong financial position. The fourth quarter wrapped up an exceptional year in which we delivered record revenue of over $103 billion, record profit of $16.7 billion, record earnings per share of $8.93, and a record free cash flow of $14 billion, up almost $2 billion year to year. That’s a lot of records. And our software profit grew 18% year to year, while we successfully integrated Cognos and Telelogic.
In services, we generated 30% profit growth, and signed over $57 billion of new business. I’ll say that again, $57 billion. And in hardware we had a successful roll-out of our z10 mainframe, which was up 12% for the year. So overall, no two ways about it, this was a very strong year for us. And building off of this base, we expect to deliver at least $9.20 of earnings per share in 2009.
Now, before moving on to the details of the quarter, I want to take a step back and talk about what’s driving our performance over the last several years. As you know, since the last time we entered a recession, we have been executing a strategy that is transforming our business. With innovation and global integration at the core of this change, we are driving a shift to higher value businesses; investing for growth in emerging markets; integrating solutions that address clients’ needs in any environment; and improving efficiency which drives higher profit margins. The results over the past several years are clear and compelling. Since 2002, we have added over $10 billion to our pre-tax profit base; our pre-tax margin more than doubled; earnings per share more than tripled; and cumulatively, we’ve generated about $65 billion of free cash flow. Now that’s a lot of cash.
Now let’s look at how those results were generated over time. Looking at IBM’s performance over the last several years, you see that we have consistently generated strong profit and cash growth since 2002. Now that was a low point where you can clearly see the impact of the last recession and the resulting actions we took that year. So what’s different now? In the IT space, that recession was more about overcapacity, which is not the case today, and the IT industry in general is much different now. But more importantly, IBM is a fundamentally different company. Today, we have much less dependence on the cyclical and commoditizing products that are most affected in the downturn. In services, we have a much more flexible labor model that can adapt to changing market environments, and much of our software is embedded in the fabric of our clients’ IT infrastructures.
A combination of the mix of our overall business, and the mix of the products and services within those businesses puts us in a much stronger position than we had going into 2002. We have implemented a tremendous amount of change this decade. We are globally integrating the company. We are investing to capture the opportunity in growth markets. We exited commoditizing businesses, including HDDs in 2002, PCs in 2005, and printers in 2007, which represents nearly $15 billion of annual revenue. In that same time, we acquired over a 100 companies for a total of about $20 billion. Now this includes the acquisition of PwC Consulting in 2002, which gave us best-of-breed process and industry skills that are critical to delivering high value services to clients, and set the stage for the performance you saw this year in GBS.
Software acquisitions such as Cognos, Telelogic, and Ascential have extended our end-to-end middleware capabilities and solidified our position as the leading middleware provider. We also invested over $50 billion in research and development, to strengthen our technology leadership. As one measure of this leadership, last week we announced that for the 16th consecutive year, we were number one in U.S. patents, with over 4,000 in 2008. That’s more than the total of Microsoft, HP, and Cisco combined.
Consistent with the direction of our business, over 70% of our patents were for software and services. And we also announced a new initiative designed to further leverage our technology leadership by significantly increasing the number of technical inventions we publish, making those inventions freely available to others, and spurring follow-on innovation, especially in support of the build-out of newer, smarter infrastructures. You can see this transformation reflected in the profit mix of our business over time.
In 2008, our pre-tax profit was $16.7 billion, and over 90% of our segment profit came from software, services, and financing. You can also see that 40% of our profit came from our software business, and 42% from services, while hardware contributed just 9%. And if you exclude the amortization of intangibles, and the year-to-year benefit from our pension in 2008, software increases to 43%. This really illustrates how our business has changed over time as a result of our significant portfolio actions and targeted investment strategies, as we shift to where we see the best long term opportunity.
Now I’ll turn to the detailed financial results for the fourth quarter. Looking at our income statement for the quarter, our revenue was $27 billion, down 6% as reported, and 1% at constant currency. We had outstanding margin performance. Gross margin expanded three points, led by services and software. Together with focused expense management, we grew pre-tax income 6% over last year, and PTI margin expanded 2.5 points. With a lower tax rate year to year, primarily driven by utilization of tax credits, net income grew 12% and margin expanded to 16.4%. So bottom line, we delivered $3.28 of earnings per share, up 17% year to year. Our balance sheet and capital structure are also on very solid ground. We finished the quarter with almost $13 billion of cash on hand, and we had continued good performance in the capital markets in the fourth quarter. Our liquidity position remains strong.
For 2008, we delivered $103.6 billion of revenue, pre-tax earnings of $16.7 billion, and earnings per share of $8.93, all record levels. We expanded margins, with gross, pre-tax, and net margin all up over a point. We generated over $14 billion of free cash flow, and returned over $13 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Let me tell you how we’ve been able to achieve these results in a tough environment. We had relatively stable revenue performance, by delivering what customers need in this environment. So for the customers that are trying to save cost and conserve capital, we can adapt our offerings to help them do that. As a proof point, of our $4.5 billion of short-term signings in GBS, about three-fourths of the signings delivered cost reduction to our clients. For our growth markets unit, where growth is driven by infrastructure build-out, we aggressively invested to capture that opportunity.
For the year, our constant currency revenue growth in these markets was eight points higher than in the major markets. And by building on our long term relationships with clients, we generate about half of our revenue in annuity businesses, which provides a solid base of revenue and cash. Our gross margin expansion was driven by a combination of three elements; mixing to higher value businesses, pricing for value, and our focus on cost management. And in expense, we’re focused on driving productivity, in sales, development, and our global support functions.
So let me get into the fourth quarter details, starting with revenue by geography. Our total geographic revenue was down 6% as reported and flat at constant currency, with mixed performance by geography. As always, I’ll focus my comments on the constant currency growth. Americas had the strongest performance, up 2%, while Europe and Asia Pacific were down 1%. Globally, the major markets declined 1%, though we had some countries that performed very well. Germany had the fastest growth of the G7 countries with 7% growth. Canada grew 6%, while the UK grew 4% and France grew 2%. The U.S. was flat, and Japan and Italy declined.
Now, in the emerging markets, our growth markets organization grew 6%. Revenue from these markets represented 18% of IBM’s geographic revenue in the quarter, and the year. We’ve been investing to capture opportunities to build out public and private infrastructures. This quarter, we also saw customers in these markets focus on cost savings, a reflection of the global economic environment. We’re obviously very well positioned to address these needs.
The BRIC countries, a subset of our growth markets, grew 13%, with strong double-digit growth in Brazil and India. China was up 9%, an improvement from the third quarter. However Russia declined as it was significantly impacted by credit limitations. But while Russia was weak, other countries, like Chile and Egypt had very strong performance. We’ll continue to shift resources to where we see the best opportunities to ensure we’re positioned to capture the growth.
Turning to our industry view, revenue was down 6%, or flat at constant currency. I’ll comment on a few of the sectors. Public sector was the fastest growing sector again this quarter with strength in government and with education returning to growth at constant currency. In the growth markets specifically, our clients are investing in education as a way to develop national skill sets. In addition to solid revenue growth, we also had good signings in the public sector, up 50% worldwide and over 100% in the U.S. Lagging overall performance was the Industrial sector, as concerns with the credit markets and margin pressures continued. Worldwide Financial Services declined 1% at constant currency, in line with IBM’s overall performance for the fifth consecutive quarter. These clients remain focused on cost reduction, risk management, and integration services. Revenue from our small and medium business clients declined 3% at constant currency; however services signings were up 10% globally, with U.S. signings up almost 90%.
So now let’s look at our revenue by segment. Our revenue performance was impacted by currency and the economic environment, but also reflects our broad business capabilities, and the contribution of our annuity content. Software was the fastest growing segment, as our customers continue to utilize IBM’s infrastructure software in their production environment to optimize their data centers. Services revenue was driven by a strong annuity base and full year growth in short term signings. Systems and Technology declined this quarter reflecting growth in high end servers offset by a decline in our x86 and storage products. In Global Financing, financing revenue was up 3%, though this was more than offset by a decline in the sales of used equipment.
But the really impressive story within our segments is margin. So let’s take a look at our progress in driving productivity. This quarter, our total expense and other income was down 5%. Eight points of the decline was due to currency, both translation of non-dollar based expenses, and the impact of the hedging programs that flow to expense. We estimate that acquisitions contributed about six points of growth. So operational expense actually improved by two points year to year. Now underneath this, we’re executing our investment strategy and allocating our spending to areas where we see the best opportunity. In our growth markets, where we’re investing to capture this rapidly growing opportunity, SG&A excluding currency and acquisitions was up 9%, while in the rest of the world it was down 5%, reflecting our focus to drive productivity in our major markets organization. However, our emphasis is not just on expense, but on our entire spending base of almost $90 billion, and you see the benefit of these operational actions in our margins. We will continue our focus on structural changes that reduce our spending levels and improve productivity in 2009.
Let me give you an example of the types of things that will contribute to ongoing margin performance. First, we’re tackling our globally integrated processes, applying the same capabilities we sell to our customers to improve efficiency and drive cost savings. As an example, we’ve announced the outsourcing of our internal logistics process to Geodis. This enables us to take advantage of industry-leading skill and scale, and ultimately improve our productivity in the supply chain. In addition to the ongoing savings, we’ll have an up-front gain when we close the transaction in the first quarter. Second, we’ll continue to drive cost out of services delivery through implementation of lean processes, tools automation and standardization and growth in our global delivery centers. And finally, we’ll continue to redeploy skills to areas of growth, moving more and more skills out of support and headquarters’ functions out to the field.
Before I show our margins by segment, I want to comment on the items that significantly impacted our profit growth this quarter. Retirement-related plans generated about $200 million of cost and expense in the quarter. This is a decrease of about $475 million year to year. About $140 million of the year-to-year improvement was a one-time gain resulting from changes to the Japan plan described last quarter. As we indicated in October, this was largely offset by fourth quarter workforce actions in Japan. For the full year 2008, retirement-related plans cost about $1.4 billion. This is better by about $1.2 billion year to year, or $1.0 billion excluding the Japan gain. As a reference point, at the beginning of the year we expected year- to-year improvement of $950 million to $1 billion.
Let me comment on the performance of our pension plans. In the U.S. plan, return on assets was down 15% for the year. While this is below our expected return, it is considerably better than the S&P performance, which was down 38%. Our non-U.S. plans which comprise about 40% of our assets, in aggregate were down 21%. So globally, our pension plans were down 17% for the year. Looking forward, we will hold our expected U.S. long-term return assumption at 8%, and we will take our discount rate down to 5.75%, reflecting the current interest rate environment. In 2009, with these assumptions, together with other factors such as changes in actuarial assumptions, we expect retirement-related cost and expense of about $1.5 billion, consistent with our 2008 cost and expense levels excluding the Japan gain. From a funding perspective, we ended the year with total assets in our defined benefit plans of about $75 billion. Our U.S. plan is 97% funded, and globally, our qualified plans are about 93% funded.
Turning to workforce rebalancing, in the fourth quarter, our workforce reduction charges were up about $380 million year to year, an impact of $0.20 per share. This includes about $120 million for the activity in Japan. The remainder of the expenses reflects the ongoing skills rebalancing that is a regular element of our business model. A couple of other items that I’ll mention, within other income and expense, interest income was down $120 million, reflecting the current interest rate environment. Currency negatively impacted our results, partially offset by our hedging programs. We hedge the major cash flows to mitigate the effect of currency volatility as we manage our cash globally. The impact of these hedging programs is reflected principally in other income and expense, and cost of goods sold. This quarter, our hedging instruments flipped from a loss to a gain, resulting in a year-to-year benefit of about $190 million in other income and expense.
Our tax rate was 23.8% in the quarter, down from the previous ongoing rate of 27.5%, which contributed $0.16 of earnings per share in the quarter. For the full year 2008, our tax rate was 26.2 %. This lower rate reflects improved foreign tax credit utilization, and the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit. Most of these benefits will be sustained, and we expect a rate of about 26.5% in 2009, so fairly consistent on a year-to-year basis.
Now, before getting into the segments, I’ll quickly show you our margin performance by segment. Our margins reflect the shift of our business to higher value areas, and our constant focus on improving productivity. Our fourth quarter margin improvement also reflects lower total managed labor costs year to year across all elements. However on a full year basis, total managed labor costs were up 5% year to year across all elements, excluding retirement related. This all contributed to great margin performance in our services segments, software and financing, while hardware declined.
So now I’ll turn to our segment performance, starting with Services. Our two Global Services segments delivered very strong margin and profit performance this quarter. On combined revenue, that was down 4% as reported and up 2% at constant currency, our services business delivered a record level of pre-tax profit, and margin of 14.5%, which was up four points year to year. We performed exceptionally well in the current economic climate, through disciplined execution on resource optimization and improved operating efficiencies, while at the same time delivering services with a very high level of quality and customer satisfaction. Signings were $17.2 billion at actual rates, down 5% and up 2% at constant currency. We signed $7.3 billion in short-term deals this quarter. Coming off a very strong fourth quarter last year, overall short term signings were down 7% at actual rates and down 1% at constant currency, while long term signings were down 3% at actual rates, and up 3% at constant currency. We signed 24 deals larger than $100 million, and that’s the highest number we’ve seen in quite some time. Backlog at the end of the year was an estimated $117 billion, up $2 billion quarter to quarter.
Now with that overview of total services business, I’ll highlight the key drivers of performance in the two services segments. Global Technology Services revenue was down 4% as reported and up 3% at constant currency. Strategic Outsourcing, our largest services business and the industry leader, was down 3% as reported and up 3% at constant currency. We really had a very strong quarter in SO signings, up 23% at constant currency. North America was up 45%, with the U.S. up 34%, and Europe was up 66%. This was really terrific performance across these units. Our Strategic Outsourcing offerings provide a compelling value proposition in this environment. In particular, our clients in the major markets are turning to outsourcing as an effective way to quickly meet their financial objectives. We’re seeing some very impressive performance in this business. Our initiatives around standardization, global integration, and improved efficiency are not just driving margin improvement, they’re also resulting in improved quality and customer sat. Our metrics in both of these areas are at some of the highest levels we’ve ever seen. Being able to drive continuous efficiency and productivity improvements while satisfying our clients is the cornerstone of this business, and is ultimately reflected in our ability to attract new business. You saw the results this quarter in our signings performance.
Integrated Technology Services revenue was flat as reported and up 6% at constant currency. Although signings were down this quarter, we continue to see good results in our key infrastructure plays. Global Technology Services pre-tax profit was up 35%, and margin was 14.4%, up four points year to year. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit pre tax profit growth, and we had gross margin expansion in all lines of business. GTS continues to execute on the bottom line, driven by a delivery structure that maximizes utilization and flexibility, a mix to higher value offerings, lower total managed labor costs; and a global skills mix that enables us to rapidly put our people where the work is. A great example of this was announced just last week. We’re opening a new Technology Services Delivery Center in Dubuque, Iowa. This center will primarily support IBM’s U.S. strategic outsourcing clients, where we will manage IBM’s world-class servers and storage systems, which are critical for assuring optimal IT infrastructure performance. This center meets our clients need for data center services, and gives IBM access to key skills.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was down 5% as reported and flat at constant currency. Cost savings offerings continue to drive the majority of business, although we’re seeing some increased demand for transformational offerings and compliance offerings. So, although market conditions remain tough and clients remain cautious, cost savings offerings continue to sell. Short term signings were $4.5 billion, down 1% at actual rates and up 4% at constant currency. As I mentioned earlier, cost savings accounted for about three-fourths of the new deals signed. By sector, Financial Services posted the strongest growth, up 27%, with Banking up 55%. Public Sector, Communications, and General Business all grew signings double digits, while Industrial and Distribution logically showed steep declines. Long term signings are down 25% at actual rates and 16% at constant currency. Public sector was a bright spot, with U.S. public sector signings up over 90%.
We recently announced the creation of a Delivery Center for Application Services located at Michigan State University. This is a first of a kind center that will provide innovative application development and support services to modernize older and less efficient IT systems for state and local government agencies and universities, certainly a timely investment. Global Business Services delivered a record level of profit again this quarter. Pre-tax profit was up 26% and margin expanded 3.6 points to 14.9%, the best ever. GBS has consistently executed with strong profit growth. 2008 represents the third straight year of profit growth greater than 20%. This demonstrates strong operating discipline, the benefits of a globally integrated operating model, stable pricing, and lower managed labor costs. So despite slower revenue growth, utilization actually improved year to year, which is a function of resource optimization, and the balancing of our domestic, global, and subcontracted resources. And we continue to be very selective and structured in our deals. We’re not just driving signings, anyone can do that. We’re driving for a long term, profitable relationship for both IBM and our clients.
Software Segment Software revenue of $6.4 billion was up 3% year to year, or 9% at constant currency. Branded middleware was 61% of our total software portfolio, and grew 6% year to year, or 13% at constant currency. We had a very strong pipeline going into the fourth quarter and our sales team showed solid execution in a difficult environment. In the quarter, WebSphere, Information Management, Lotus, and Tivoli software sold well. Many of our largest customers signed multi-year deals with us, demonstrating continued commitment to IBM technology. These customers value the depth and breadth of our product portfolio, and world-class support capabilities. The Americas had a particularly strong quarter, up 10%, or 13% at constant currency, with good growth in both large and small deals, up 11% and 5% respectively.
Let me give you some insight into our branded middleware performance. Information Management software grew 18%, or 25% at constant currency. Information Management grew organically and Cognos also had a terrific fourth quarter. Since the launch of our Information on Demand initiative in early 2006, Information Management software has grown at a compounded rate of 18% over the last 12 quarters. Distributed Relational Database has grown at 14% over the same period, and in the fourth quarter alone, our Distributed Relational Database grew over 30% at constant currency. WebSphere software was down 1%, and up 5% at constant currency. In December, we completed the acquisition of iLog, which helps customers improve business decisions with optimization, visualization, and business rules software. Lotus was flat at actual rates, and up 6% at constant currency, capitalizing on the strong performance of our collaboration software. Tivoli software was down 4%, but was up 4% at constant currency. Tivoli’s software provides the advanced capabilities required to run large mission critical environments. This includes systems management; security and storage software which helps customers improve utilization and reduce costs. Rational was down 1% at actual rates but grew 5% at constant currency versus a difficult compare. The constant currency growth was fueled by the Telelogic acquisition. The Software segment pre-tax income grew 15% year to year to $2.8 billion. The large annuity base in our software business continues to provide a predictable and growing stream of profit and cash for IBM. We’ve been investing heavily in our software business for some time, with good results. Our revenue in 2008 was over $22 billion, and in the last five years pre-tax profits have more than doubled to $7 billion.
Systems & Technology revenue of $5.4 billion was down 20% year to year, or 16% at constant currency. Our system z and converged system p servers did well, but our x86 platform declined. In this tough macro-environment, customers are focused on reducing the cost of running their IT infrastructure. Virtualization, which provides the ability to run multiple workloads on a server, is a key enabler of efficiency. System z is the ultimate platform for virtualization, able to support thousands of images and run fully utilized. Our POWER architecture supports hundreds of partitions, often driving utilization rates of over 60%. Both of these platforms leverage the entire system, from their custom semiconductors right through the software stack, to achieve these high levels of efficiencies, and lower cost of ownership. By contrast, the distributed computing model, with many small servers and typical utilization rates of less than 20%, simply cannot offer the same level of efficiency and value.
Now let’s turn our focus to the brands. System z revenue declined 6% year to year, but was up 1% at constant currency. MIPS grew 12%. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit MIPS growth. MIPS from specialty engines were up 43%, driven by new workloads on the mainframe. We had very strong growth in the Americas, revenue was up double-digits. By sector, Financial Services and Industrial sectors were particularly strong. Converged System p delivered 8% revenue growth, or 14% at constant currency. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of year to year revenue growth. The energy efficiency and multi-operating system capabilities of POWER6 technology continues to resonate with customers. Coupled with exceptional performance, POWER6 is the right solution for a multitude of workloads. The result is strong performance in both high-end and mid-range servers, both growing 16% at constant currency. Storage revenue declined 20% year to year. Disk was down 16%, and tape declined 31%. System x server revenue declined 32% year to year, with blades down 27%. This reflects a significant slowdown in the x86 market, as customers are virtualizing and consolidating workloads into more efficient platforms such as POWER and mainframe. So as you look at these results, you can see that the industry standard hardware is clearly more susceptible to an economic downturn.
Turning to IBM’s cash performance, we generated $7.9 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up $600 million year to year. For the year, our free cash flow was up $1.9 billion to $14.3 billion. The year-to-year improvement was driven by growth in net income and tight controls on capital spending. Our collection performance for the quarter and the year was very strong. Our ability to consistently generate a high level of free cash flow positions us well for 2009. When I look at the uses of cash for the year, we have funded net capital investment of about $4.5 billion, and invested $6.3 billion in acquisitions. This is the highest level of acquisition spending in IBM’s history. We also returned $13.2 billion to shareholders. $2.6 billion of this was through dividends. And we bought back 90 million shares for $10.6 billion, including $700 million this quarter. To put our 2008 spend in perspective, on a net share repurchase basis, which includes the impact of employee stock purchases, we returned $6.8 billion to shareholders, which is consistent with our 2005 and 2006 spend rate. And at the end of the year, we had $5.6 billion remaining from our last Board authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we finished 2008 with a strong cash balance of nearly $13 billion, up $3 billion from September. Our experience in the capital markets in the fourth quarter was very positive. We raised $5 billion of term financing. And while our experience in the Commercial Paper market remains unchanged, we reduced our CP balance by paying off $4 billion of the $4.5 billion that was outstanding at the end of September. So we finished with less than $500 million of outstanding CP at the end of the year. In addition, we retired $1 billion of debt from our 2009 maturities. We are well-positioned for 2009 with our strong cash balance, CP flexibility, $10 billion global credit facility and our positive experience in the capital markets. Turning to debt, our total debt of almost $34 billion is down $1.3 billion year to year and down $500 million in the quarter. Of the $34 billion, $24 billion supports our Global Financing segment, leveraged at 7 to 1.
Regarding our Global Financing business, almost 60% of this portfolio is investment grade, as you can see in the supplemental charts. 97% of this portfolio is in our core competency of technology equipment and solution financing. There are no exotic assets, and as you would expect, no consumer or mortgage exposures. And finally, while our reserves have increased, consistent with the economic environment, this business still provides a very strong 29% return on equity. Our remaining debt, the non-financing debt was $9.6 billion, down $1.2 billion year to year. This debt is supported by our cash balances of $12.9 billion and our annual free cash flows, which were over $14 billion in 2008. I am very comfortable with this level of debt relative to those repayment sources. Non-financing debt-to-cap increased to 49% reflecting an equity reduction of over $15 billion due to lower returns on our pension funds. This in turn reduced total stockholders equity to $13.5 billion by year end. But this impact on book equity is non-cash, and does not affect our borrowing capacity or our liquidity.
Now let me start to wrap up with a discussion of the drivers of our 17% earnings per share growth. Our revenue declined 6%, including five points of year-to-year currency impact. At constant mix and margin, this 6% decline reduced EPS growth by $0.18. Now once again, by far, the biggest driver of our earnings growth was gross margin expansion, led by higher margins in services and software, and a mix to higher margin businesses. Gross margin improvement contributed $0.41 of EPS growth in the quarter. Expense productivity impacted EPS growth by $0.07, driven by acquisitions. Within that, we absorbed a $0.20 year-to-year impact from restructuring. A lower tax rate contributed $0.17 to EPS growth, and we had $0.15 from share buyback. When you look at this chart, it’s clear that the growth came from margin expansion, the result of an improved business mix and an ongoing focus on increasing operational efficiencies. You’ll see the same holds for the full year. Looking at the 2008 bridge, we had contribution from several items. But similar to the fourth quarter performance, you can see the largest contribution came from margin expansion, driven by improved mix, a shift to higher value businesses, and a focus on cost management and improved productivity.
Now, let me wrap up. To maintain leadership in the IT industry, you need to continue to innovate, integrate, and reinvent yourself. For the last several years, we have been executing a strategy to transform our business. Shifting to higher value services and software, with less dependence on commoditizing and cyclical business. In hardware, the value has shifted to the high end to address clients’ needs to consolidate and virtualize their environments. Our services business now contributes 42% of IBM’s segment profit, and over 60% of IBM resources. It’s also a fundamentally different business, more flexible, and more focused on higher value areas. Our software capabilities have grown through internal investment and acquisition, and in the last five years our software profit has more than doubled to over $7 billion. In 2008, over 80% of our segment profit came from services and software, and over 90% was from services, software and financing.
So we have changed the profile of the business to make it more adaptable, with offerings that allow us to succeed in a variety of different environments. We are entering the current market from a position of strength. We will take advantage of the environment to continue to execute our strategies and make ourselves even stronger. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest to capture new infrastructure spending in emerging markets. Although some of these economies have slowed, they still offer good growth opportunity relative to the rest of the world. We moved very quickly to develop strong value propositions for our established markets, based on cost reduction, capital conservation and risk management. Our high value, integrated offerings, like green data centers, and outsourcing and virtualization on high end systems, have performed well in this environment. You can see that even in tough sectors like financial services.
And finally, we see a real opportunity in smart infrastructure as governments around the world launch massive stimulus programs focused on things like next generation smart grids, healthcare IT and broadband. These projects require both technology integration as well as deep industry insight, so IBM is uniquely positioned to help advance these efforts around the world. The key here is to move quickly to ensure our skills are appropriately balanced with these high value opportunities. We’ll also continue to focus on cost reduction and improved efficiency. But as you know, the true measure of success of cost and expense reduction is how this translates to profit and margin growth. In 2008, we had terrific margin expansion, and we’ll continue this into 2009. So as we enter 2009, we expect EPS of at least $9.20 per share for the year. Given what we are seeing in the economy, we’re not counting on constant currency revenue growth to achieve this, it’ll come more from margin improvement, just as it did in 2008. And with this strong 2008 performance, we are clearly ahead of pace on our roadmap to $10 to $11 of earnings per share.
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark’s prepared remarks. Second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I’ll turn the call back to Mark for some final remarks.

Thank you. At this time, we would like to begin the question and answer session of the conference. (Operator instructions). The first question comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
David Bailey – Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you very much. Could you comment on the duration of the services contracts that you have signed in 2008 compared to 2007 and have you seen rescoping of existing contracts or cancellations pickup as of late?
Mark Loughridge
Yes. If you look at the duration, David, the duration in 2008 was about a half year longer than we saw in 2007 and it was about the average what we saw for the prior two years. So I don’t take a big message from that. As far as the repricing, rescoping, I think it was fairly typical. I mean obviously we always go through those kind of discussions with our clients, but in this kind of environment, we also are very focused on delivering additional value to our clients. And additional value to help them in this environment save costs, conserve capital, and deal with the risk and compliance.

The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi – Sanford Bernstein
Yes, thank you. It looks like you will have a significant year over year contribution again in 2009, from a lower share count, and from a modestly more favorable tax rate. I think if you back those out, your guidance appears to imply relatively flat or slightly down operating profit dollars in 2009. Can you comment on, given the fact that you appear to be forecasting improving margins through productivity initiatives and potentially gross margin, can you comment on what that replies about your expectations for revenue growth that would suggest that it would be materially negative?
Mark Loughridge
Well, first of all, let me just go back on your initial statement about tax. I mean the tax rate for quarter as we go in from 2008 to 2009 is actually, given that the actuals of fourth quarter, Tony, is modestly up, right, from 26.2 to 26.5. But nevertheless, I still think it’s a very good question. I mean as we looked at it, I said in the tax, that we have built a plan to deliver on $9.20 as an at least statement. And within that constant currency, we didn’t anticipate we are not building that assuming we are going to grow that constant currency revenue growth. And with currency clearly working against us, that implied that revenue will be down especially through the first three quarters of 2009 at today’s spot rate. So I think we have already built in a significant impact to revenue. We do think that we can manage through that however quite successfully. I think you saw that in the fourth quarter by continuing to drive real margin performance and productivity at the expense lines. So we’re pretty confident that even in the face of a difficult environment with the actions that we are taking an the ability to move to higher value content, mix improvement through the year, ongoing cost initiatives to consistently drive better cost base, that we can maintain our commitment to an least $9.20 for 2009.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Tony. Let’s go to the next question.

The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Mark Moskowitz – JPMorgan
Thank you. Good afternoon. Quick question here on the BRIC growth. Mark, could you give us sort of a qualitative context around how much of the growth is driven by US or European companies setting up shop in the BRIC regions versus actual domestic companies in those regions?
Mark Loughridge
Well, let me – first of all, from the date I haven’t seen data that says that this is substantively driven by nine US companies in those growth market locations. But I think one way to look at the growth performance in the quarter, we had very, very good growth in Brazil, at growth of 17%. If you looked at India, we’re up 30%, another very, very powerful quarter. China came back from the impact that we saw from the Olympics with growth of 9%. We did have the impact from Russia, that was down. And I think given all of the analysis and news that I’m sure you have done as well as us, I think that is quite logical. But still, if you look at the BRIC countries, they came in at 13% growth which at 13% is very consistent with what we saw for the year. So we still see very good ongoing opportunities.
And one thing that I would comment on that I think is also an important analysis when you look at these growth markets, look at the growth rate, albeit there has been some reduction in that growth rate in the second half. But look at that growth rate relative to major market growth, and that differential has been in this kind of 8% range for some time. So, even as we have seen some slowing which when I analyze that slowing, it is not – I wouldn’t paint all of the countries with the same brush. Many countries continued to have this very vital, vibrant growth were impacted by some countries that saw some deceleration due to economic conditions, but that relative differential of growth market, the major markets at constant currency maintained at about the 8% differential. So, it still has a very, very strong investment characteristics that we are interested in.
But as we look at the investment and growth markets, we’re looking at the long-term. I mean believe me, as we roll out our offerings and our investments, we’re looking at what we think growth markets are going to be in a decade, not just a year. And so in good times, and bad times, we’re going to continue to exploit those opportunities. We think it presents very good investment opportunities for us, that margin and differential to major markets is ongoing, and we think they are going to be big contributors to the world economy over the next decade.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Operator, let’s take the next question please.

The next question comes from Bill Shope with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.
Bill Shope – Credit Suisse
Okay, thank you. Mark, last quarter you noted that you expected to see improvements in x86 segment by the first quarter of 2009? Is that still the plan or has market conditions just fundamentally changed since then? And within that context, can you give us your view or some clarity on strategic importance of this business to the overall hardware portfolio and the overall IBM portfolio?
Mark Loughridge
Yes, sure. I’d be happy to do that. Let’s start with kind of a discussion of the strategic importance. The x System is an important element of our portfolio, so that when we put our broad based solutions together, we can use those to deliver value to our customer set. And to the extent that the customer is looking for that x86, that blade content, we want to make sure we have real capability that we can use to solve their problems. But if you look at the fourth quarter, let’s think about what the environment looks like from a customer standpoint. What is the customer looking to do? Number one, that customer is looking to improve their cost base, are looking to save on capital expenditures. They are looking for improvement in their cash base, and you just cannot beat the mainframe system and the p series systems to provide that kind of capability. I mean you can utilize a mainframe system up to the 100% of its capacity, or a p series up to 60% of its capacity. An x86 system, generally even in precision operations, less than 20%, so it just doesn’t have that capability to solve that particular customer problem, which I think is at the forefront of – their concern is they put together their budgets going forward. So I think naturally you’d see better performance from the high end of our product line with mainframe and p series, both showing strong growth characteristics as opposed to what we saw in the x86 platform.
Now in addition, you just can’t separate from the fact that even in kind of market intelligence analysis, even in this kind of an economy, the market view of the UNIX platform has stayed down 2%, 3%, but x86 is down 14%, 15%. So it is kind of four times more negative view of the opportunity set. So I think it’s a combination of those factors that accounts for the difference. But I think our Harbour platform gives us real opportunity to virtualization and cost savings, to deliver real value to our customer set in this kind of an environment.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Bill. Let’s take the next question please.

The next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup. You may ask your question.
Richard Gardner – Citigroup
Okay, thank you. Mark, I think a lot of folks expected strength to continue to the end of calendar 2008, but a lot of investors are concerned that there might be a sharp fall off in 2009 as the budgets get reset and as your customers become concerned about economic conditions this year. Your guidance implies that you think things continue to be strong but can you give us any sort of sense as to how things are shaking out so far, whether you have seen a sharp off in the business? And as a corollary, whether there is any reason to expect the contribution of earnings throughout the year per quarter to be any different this year than it has been in the past?
Mark Loughridge
Okay. There’s a couple of points to deal with there. Let’s start with kind of the distribution across the year, and then we will come back and talk about what we're seeing in the demented environment. So if you look at the quarterly skew that we're anticipating in 2009, we think that the first-half, first quarter, first half of next year, from an economic standpoint is going to be more difficult than the second half. We believe that with the stimulus packages being rolled out globally that the economy starts to improve as we go into the back half of the year. And like that assumption, we think that in the first quarter, our performance will be relatively flat on a year to year basis with an expanding role in our EPS as we go into the second quarter, and certainly the second half of the year.
Now within that, there is a lot of moving parts in that first quarter. First of all though we expect the workforce rebalancing to be in kind of the normal range that we run every year, say $300 million to $400 million, I do think that it's going to be more front end skewed, and that front end skewing will impact the first quarter to some degree. On the other hand, as we have outsourced the logistics process for our business to Geodis, again that will occur in the first quarter, we expect will offset that. So I think there is a lot of moving parts, but if I put it all together, I think the first quarter is going to be relatively flat, and growth prospects in the second and the fourth quarter.
Now as far as the demand profile, as we go into the first quarter, let's go down – some of the brands on the software base of business, and we gave you the distribution of our profitability, so let's start from the fact that 90% of our profit now comes from software services and financing. But as we start with software, again we think we have a pretty good pipeline going into the first quarter. And not only do we see a pretty good pipeline going into the first quarter, versus typical first quarter pipelines, it's relatively more mature. So I think we have a good operating position going into the first quarter. And as we go through 2009, I would think we will see again a combination of both opportunities and our work on productivity and efficiency, we ought to be able to generate double-digit profit growth over the year from software.
Now let's go to services. On a services basis, as we go through – look at the opportunity, you saw the growth that we had in our SO signings from the fourth quarter. I mean we are the largest SO provider on the globe and it grow 23% at constant currency signings in the fourth quarter, and North America was up 45%. So that gives you a lot of business as you move into the next quarter, the reason that our backlog is up from $114 billion to $117 billion as we enter the year. Our short-term signings have been three years of growth. We think we have a very good handle on that. As we go into the first quarter, you saw real strength in our GBS short term signings, was sort of at the highest level we have ever achieved. So I put all that together and I say although we will still be focused on margins as the key contributor to our profit growth, we are looking to do double-digit profit growth over the year from both of those segments as well. So all of that together with the work that we are doing to drive more efficient, streamlined and productive structure in the back half of our business as well, leads me to believe that we can accomplish our view of at least $9.20 for 2009.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Richard. Let's go to the next question please.

The next question comes from Scott Craig with Banc of America/Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.
Scott Craig – Banc of America/Merrill Lynch
Thanks, good afternoon. Mark, one thing on the restructuring opportunities here, it sounds like you are just pulling forward a little bit of what would be some normal workforce reductions. But in an environment like this that seems tougher than we have seen over the past couple of years, and even you're pointing to some revenue challenges, is there an opportunity to do some larger restructuring outside of the realm of what you would consider normal?
Mark Loughridge
Well, let's look at the restructuring in the quarter to begin with. I mean if you just look at the yield off that fourth quarter restructuring, that alone would improve our spend base by about $1 billion in 2009 which we expect to drop to the bottom line. So I think it already has a fair amount of yield in it. And if you look at the restructuring that we have done, in most years, and you can go back some time, we do about $300 million to $400 million of restructuring that consistently drives improvement in our cost base. We did more of this year. In 2008, it was a little north of 700, but if you take out the Japan action, we are back down about $580 million. So I think we have got a good plan there. There will be, as I said, some acceleration in 2009, but the total 2009 workforce rebalancing number will be in kind of normal range. And as a look across all of the actions that we are taking on cost and expense and spending, I think we have a very good plan and a very good hand to play as we go into 2009. You’ve certainly started to play out in 2008.

Keith Bachman – Bank of Montreal
Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask about the revenue growth and more specifically, Mark, how much either of software of IBM total did software acquisitions add in Q4 with Cognos? And as we look over at 2009, given your characterization, what's presenting challenges to systems and technology, wouldn't that suggest that the revenue growth of that entity will continue to be significantly negative, large double-digit negative type of growth, and therefore would expect to see more margin pressure there throughout the balance of 2009? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
Okay. If you look at our branded middleware, I think they did quite well in the quarter. We did have a very good quarter with our acquisitions. Cognos did do a great job. But we have pretty good organic performance in the quarter from our branded middleware content at constant currency, and I think we can carry that on. I’d also remind you that as we grew this business, albeit good contribution from our acquisitions, we really grow that profitability at the bottom line. And the profitability on a GAAP basis also had overcome the amortization of intangibles as well as the additional developments that we acquired in those businesses. So remember that profit performance had to overcome those elements of the accounting structures since we report on a full GAAP basis, and it still generated really strong profit contribution from our software business. So as I look forward, I think we ought to be able to maintain that ramp up profitability in the software business.

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital. You may ask your question.
Ben Reitzes – Barclays Capital
Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about margins a little bit more. It sounds like you definitely are expecting revenue decline in your guidance, but of the 300 basis point margin benefit in gross margin year over year, it seems like maybe you lose a third to pension, but you could still carry through significant benefit unless there is either pressure from the lower revenue that maybe hit some fixed cost or pricing, and I was just wondering what the puts and takes are and what you are expecting for gross margin line in particular for 2009, Mark?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Well, let me first of all go back to you statement. I mean as we pointed out, when you look at pension, pension expense is going to be relatively flat on a year to year basis. So I would count it, excluding the Japan pension gain, if you exclude that, it’s pretty flat on a year over year basis, I would count it as neither a head wind nor a tailwind. And if you look at the revenue decline based on the fact that we are kind of structuring this assuming no constant currency revenue growth, the real negative comes from the currency impact in the first three quarters of the year. So we take very specific actions to counter that. You know that we hedge cash flows and that the hedged cash flows helps us to substantially offset a lot of that currency impact. We have natural hedges because we source different products from different geographies, so the natural hedges help. We price to offset currency movements across our business lines as well as specify terms and conditions on the contract structure to help mitigate the effect. And that's the biggest element of this negative revenue growth performance.
So then you look at it on top of that, you say, well, okay, I understand that it mitigates the negative impact of currency, how about your base level performance? We continue to move to higher value offerings, benefits from mix benefits. We will continue to display that. I think has been very successful for us and the major markets have constantly driving productivity to yield profit growth in the growth markets to satisfy those customer requirements of infrastructure, cost and capital conservation, which are not peripheral commodity like product installations. In many of those, we have had some of our biggest back office installations of that from the growth markets. So I put all of that together, and I look at it, and I think we certainly have enough capability to deal with the challenges that we are facing on both a tough economy and the headwind of currency and still achieve our objective of at least $9.20.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Ben. Let’s go to the next question please.

The next question comes from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Katie Huberty – Morgan Stanley
Thanks, good evening. Mark, how would you characterize your appetite for acquisitions in light of current market conditions, your cash levels, valuations, et cetera?
Mark Loughridge
Well, that is a very good question, because as we close out the year, I mean we have $12 billion in cash. We just looked at our free cash flow generation, that was very, very powerful. So we have good cash flow generation capability of the business with free cash flow. We have got a lot of cash on hand as we close off the year, and there are a lot of alternatives that we will look at as we utilize that cash most effectively. We have got good investments to make in our base level of business, to exploit what we see as being opportunities in cloud computing and a smarter planet. We see opportunities in our own stock price because we would get a much bigger yield of that dollar spent on a share now because one, it is obviously at a lower price, but there won't be any dilution against this. But third, you know valuations in the marketplace are very attractive. And our operating capability to acquire, integrate and exploit those values I think has been very, very credible and very reliable for us and did a pretty darn good job in 2008. So I think they all have very attractive elements and I think we are in good shape to exploit them given our cash balance and our free cash flow generation.
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Katie. Let's go to the next question please.

The next question comes from Maynard Um with UBS. You may ask your question.
Maynard Um – UBS
Hi, thanks. If I could just ask the margin question another way, in some of the segments you’re already achieving margins at levels that you haven't seen or haven't seen in a while or ever, and reaching levels closer to the those of your respective segment peers. I'm just curious, do you think you can close the gap across the different segments in reaching those levels of margin expansion because IMO I think you have done a great job on the margins, just a little bit surprising that further margin improvement is really what's going to drive the EPS upside going into 2009? Can you just let us extrapolate a little bit here and let us know if you think you can close that gap with your peers? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
Sure, absolutely. That's – bottom line, that obviously our plan, is we are only climbing on building this at kind of flat revenue on a constant currency basis. So when I look at it, we did have really good margin performance at our services business. But you know that margin wasn't the all time high for services either, and I look at the capability that we're driving in our services business, then I think there is more to be had. When I look at our software business, I don't expect to see substantial improvement in our margin software, but I do expect that we will mix more into our software business, and that mix is going to fall to the bottom line. And then lastly, I know what our plans are for cost takeout against the $90 billion spend base and we have been very effective here. And you have seen that in our current level of performance. So when I put all of that together, against that headwind that we earlier discussed of a difficult economy and currency against this, I think we have sufficient alternatives and levers, capabilities, good plans in place to achieve the margin performance required to deliver that $9.20.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Maynard. Let's go to the next question please.

We have one question left and that question comes from David Grossman with Thomas Weisel. You may ask your question.
David Grossman – Thomas Weisel Partners
Sure. My question is actually on the mainframe, it looks like growth obviously continued to slow in the fourth quarter. First, is there anything that you can share with us that would provide better insight into how to think about performance in 2009? And second, is there any guide for us that you can give us to think of how a slowing mainframe cycle in 2009 will affect the other two segments in software and services?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Well, if you look at the mainframe, I mean we had I think pretty good performance. I mean we shipped the z10 and grew revenue 12% year to year for the year. In the quarter, we had MIPS up 12%. So as I look forward, and the ability for the mainframe to solve customers requirements, to substantially improve their cost structure, to me it would still look like very good opportunity ahead of us. So I kind of look at it and compare it to the z9. I mean the z9 product cycle was ten quarters long. It had MIPS growth for eight of those ten, and it had revenue growth for six of the ten. And I think that the rollout of the z10 and that life cycle will be reasonably similar to that z9 profile. Now the mainframe does face a tough compare in the first half of 2009, so I don't think that’s going to roll out exactly every quarter. But over the course of the year and certainly going into the second half, I think the mainframe will continue to have a longer life cycle than the earlier models, much like the z9 cycle, and be more extended and predictable as we go through the year.
So let me take this opportunity to wrap up. While I completely understand that 2009 will no doubt be a challenging economic environment, we are ending the year I think in a very strong position. We have financial flexibility across our free cash flow, our cash balance, our position at the end of the year, and we're very well positioned to deliver the results, even in an environment where revenue growth is difficult. We have transformed this business to be more adaptable and to drive margin growth. I think you can really see that in those additional charts that we have provided, showing our performance over a longer period of time, not just in growth of profit, cash and earnings per share, but also the change of that mix of our business, we performed the elements of our offerings. And in the process, a greater mix towards software and services has also made IBM more competitive in these high value opportunities.
So we are encouraged by the performance of our offerings and solutions portfolio as clients prioritize for cost reduction and capital conservation and risk management. As we look forward, we think there is a lot of opportunity in next edition infrastructure projects that stimulate economic activity and global competitiveness. Now you have seen what we’ve thought on some of these products and projects like small utility systems and healthcare IT and broadband networks. They are very complex IT systems, demanding complex solutions, but we believe the investment we have made over the past decade in deep process insight and the integration of our software, hardware and services business positions IBM very well to make important contributions to these efforts. So admittedly, there is a lot of uncertainty in the current business environment, but with the strategy we have in place, and the transformation we continue to drive, I really like our hand. And I believe we are well positioned to come out even stronger as things improve, but as always, it is back to work.
Thank you very much.

Mark Loughridge
Thanks for joining us today. Last week, we reported our third quarter revenue, profit, earnings per share, and free cash flow results. At that time, we also reaffirmed our full year guidance.  Today, I want to take you through the details behind the results.  
This is a tough environment, but we were ready for it. We are executing a play that we called some time ago.  It has two major elements. First, we have been investing to capture opportunities in the emerging markets. You can see the benefit in our results again this quarter with double-digit revenue growth and good returns. Second, in the more established markets our goal has been to drive productivity. We’ve been systematically attacking our spending base, taking out infrastructure costs, reducing our cost and expense levels, and improving our efficiency. 
Because of these actions we have a more efficient structure. So in the third quarter, when the revenue growth in the major markets slowed, we had great margin performance and hit our profit objectives. 
These ongoing actions to address spending shore up the base in tough times.  But they also improve our balance point over the long run. Our focus on continuous improvement is an element of our model and an important driver of our 2010 earnings-per-share roadmap.   
Now there’s another important aspect of our model, and that’s the balance between annuity and transaction-type businesses. We have a number of annuity businesses like outsourcing, maintenance, and the majority of software that not only provide a good revenue foundation but also provide a steady source of profit and cash. We’ve been building these businesses and their recurring revenue streams for years. They’re part of our DNA and they provide a distinct advantage in today’s environment. 
So our annuity base, together with our ongoing structural changes in the business, resulted in solid profit performance in the quarter. We’ve been focused on this for some time, and it was clearly the right game plan for the third quarter. We’ll continue this same operational plan in the fourth quarter and into 2009, as we focus on delivering solid profit and cash.  
For the year, we expect earnings per share of at least $8.75, which is up 22% over last year. And while the current environment is challenging, we have the right operational plan to drive double-digit revenue growth in emerging markets, substantial productivity in major markets, and continue to extract cost and expense from our spending base and drive ongoing improvements to meet our full year objectives. 
So now let’s get into the third quarter performance, starting with the Financial Summary. 
Our revenue was $25.3 billion, up 5% as reported, and 2% at constant currency. We had outstanding margin performance.  Gross margin expanded 2 points, led by services and software. Together with focused expense management, we grew pre-tax income 19% over last year, and PTI margin expanded 1.8 points. And with a half-point improvement in our tax rate, net income grew 20% and margin expanded to over 11%. 
Bottom line, we delivered $2.05 of earnings per share, up 22% year to year. 
Our balance sheet and capital structure are also on very solid ground.  We finished the quarter with almost $10 billion in cash on hand, and we demonstrated strong access to the debt markets by raising an additional $4 billion last week.  Our liquidity position is also very strong -- I’ll address cash, balance sheet and liquidity later in the webcast. 
Let’s get into the details of the quarter with a few different views of our revenue. I’ll start with a geographic view. Our total geographic revenue was up 6% as reported, 3% at constant currency. Europe had the strongest performance, up 4% at constant currency, while Americas was up 2%, and Asia Pacific up 1%. I’ll discuss these results through the lens of our major market and growth market organizations. 
In the more established markets that we address through our major markets organization we are uniquely positioned to assist enterprise clients with high value transformational projects as they retool for efficiency and cost savings. Our model in these markets is based on delivering high value solutions and driving productivity. This quarter, major markets grew 5% as reported and 1% at constant currency. 
Now let me give you a sense of how some of the larger countries performed at constant currency. Of the G7, Canada had the fastest growth for the second consecutive quarter with  6% growth. The U.K. grew 3%, while Italy, Germany and France each grew 2%. The U.S. grew 1% and Japan declined. 
Now in the emerging markets, we’ve been investing heavily to capture opportunities to build out public and private infrastructures.  Our growth markets organization grew 13% as reported and 10% at constant currency, representing 19% of IBM’s geographic revenue in the quarter. The BRIC countries, a subset of our growth markets, grew 19% as reported and 12% at constant currency with strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Russia and India. 
However, our results in China slowed to 3% growth, down 4% at constant currency. The Olympics were a tremendous success for China; however, we do believe the focus caused a delay in IT spending decisions and we did not fully anticipate the breadth and duration of this delay. We believe that the fundamental growth opportunity in China continues to be compelling and we are continuing to invest in capabilities to capture the growth.  
I should note that the growth markets organization excluding China grew over  12% at constant currency, in line with their first half growth.   
Turning to another perspective on revenue, the business from our industry sales units was up 6%, or 3% at constant currency.  I’ll comment on a few of the sectors. 
We had strength in the Public sector, driven by government and healthcare industries. Healthcare growth accelerated this quarter as clients continue to look for more cost effective business models. In Government we had good growth in both major and growth markets.  In the US, our government business grew 7%.  In our growth markets, revenue grew 33% as governments in these countries use technology for national development. 
Lagging overall performance was the Industrial sector, as concerns with the credit markets and margin pressures impacted near term spending decisions. Worldwide Financial Services results were roughly in-line with our total sector performance for the fourth consecutive quarter.   
I’ll remind you that about 60% of our Financial Services revenue is in annuity businesses. The U.S. revenue was down 1%, slightly better than our second quarter performance.  However, outside the U.S., where we generate over 75% of our business, revenue was up 10%, or 4% at constant currency. Globally, we had growth in banking and insurance but financial markets revenue was down at constant currency.   
There have been some comments recently about closings and consolidations in the financial services sector. I’d like to address those comments now. 
Earlier this month The New York Times, using Bloomberg data, published a timeline of buy-out and takeover activities of major financial institutions in the U.S. and Europe since the middle of last year. There were 21 companies in total, you can see the names here, and we have included the original exhibit from the article in our supplemental charts. The amount of revenue IBM generates from these institutions is only about 1% of IBM’s total revenue and about the same portion of our outstanding receivables, so this should give you some perspective on the amount of business we do with these firms as it compares to IBM’s total business.    
So now let’s look at our revenue by segment. From a segment perspective, software had the best growth rate, leveraging a solid annuity base as well as acquisitions. Services revenue continued to be driven by good short term signings performance. 
Systems and Technology was most impacted by a slowdown in transactions at the end of the quarter, though we had strong demand for high end systems as customers looked to optimize their infrastructures through virtualization and consolidation. 
In Global Financing, financing revenue was up 6%, though this was more than offset by a decline in the sales of used equipment.  I’ll come back to our financing business a little later. 
So now let’s turn to Expense. Total expense and other income was up 6%. Approximately four points of growth was due to currency and we estimate that five points of growth is from acquisitions, driven primarily by Cognos and Telelogic. So operational expense actually improved by four points year to year. Underneath this we’re executing our investment strategy and allocating our spending to areas where we see the best opportunity.  
In our growth markets, where we’re investing to capture the fast growing opportunity, SG&A excluding currency and acquisitions was up 15%.  While in the rest of the world it improved 4% year to year, reflecting our focus to drive productivity in our major markets organization. Our emphasis is not just on expense, but on our entire spending base and you see the benefit of these operational actions in our margins.  
Let me give you an example of the types of things we’re working on. We spend over 15% of our $90 billion spend base on what we call Global Support Functions -- think of it as back office functions like Finance, Human Resources, and Sales Support. Our objective is to drive 5% savings annually. We’re well on our way to achieving our 2008 target, having reduced our spending by 4% through the first three quarters.  And by the end of this year, we will have reduced our spending by $1.4 billion since the end of 2006. 
We are continuing the same approach to improve our spending structure and drive efficiency into the fourth quarter and 2009.   
Before I show our margins by segment, I want to comment on the items that significantly impacted our profit growth this quarter. First, we took additional specific reserves against our accounts receivable balance, reflecting the current economic environment in many industries.  This contributed to a year-to-year increase in AR Provisions of about $125 million and increased our reserve coverage on accounts receivable to 2%, up 50 basis points from a year ago and up 30 basis points from June. 
Second, retirement-related plans generated about $380 million of cost and expense in the quarter for a savings of about $275 million year to year. For the full year, retirement-related cost is expected to be $1.5 billion, which is $1.1 billion better than 2007. 
This includes the termination of the Career Choice Retirement Plan in Japan in the fourth quarter. That will result in a one-time benefit in retirement-related costs of approximately $100 million.  This will be largely offset by fourth quarter workforce actions in Japan  designed to improve Japan’s structural competitiveness. 
Now, before getting into the segments, I’ll quickly show you our margin performance by segment. You can see that we had good margin performance in both services segments and in software. Despite a benefit from mix, hardware margins were down due primarily to the performance of our industry standard servers. Overall, gross margin was up 2 points and pre-tax margin up 1.8 points.  This is driven by our ongoing cost and expense initiatives.  
I just talked about one to address expense, let me mention another to drive a more efficient cost structure. Global Technology Services service delivery contributes over $1 billion of annual productivity savings by shifting resources to global delivery centers, improving our processes, and improving our tools -- all designed for more efficient support to our clients. You can see the benefit to our services margins, GTS was better by over 2 points year to year. 
So now I’ll move on to a broader discussion of our Services segment. Our two Global Services segments leveraged their very strong margin performance to drive strong profit growth this quarter. 
Together, pre-tax profit was up 23% on revenue growth of 8% as reported and 4% at constant currency.  This was the highest level of services pre-tax margin in six years, it’s especially important given that we did it in the seasonally challenging third quarter. 
Signings were $12.7 billion at actual rates, down 4%, while at constant currency, signings were $11.1 billion, down 5% year to year. Overall short-term signings were up 13% at actual rates and up 8% at constant currency. Short term signings were up in both the growth markets and the major markets. Long term signings were down 16% at actual rates and down 15% at constant currency coming off very strong performance last year. But we had good long term signings performance in the growth markets, up almost 60%. We signed nine deals larger than $100 million, and our backlog was an estimated $114 billion. 
So let me tell you what we’re seeing in the marketplace. There are a lot of enterprises dealing with a tough environment, looking for ways to reduce costs, conserve capital, and in some cases just to survive so there’s a lot of good services opportunity out there. But frankly, there are also many deals that have very unattractive economics, and while these may be interesting to some of our competitors, they’re not to us.  It’s not hard to drive revenue in a services business on a weak book of business. But we’ve built a strong and profitable business and we’re not going to put that at risk just to show a higher level of signings. 
I think the most impressive aspect of the business this quarter was the margin expansion and profit growth. This is a function of the quality of our portfolio of contracts and our ongoing programs to drive operational efficiencies and structural changes to our cost base. 
Over the past few years we’ve talked quite a bit about the changes we’re making to our delivery structure in Services.  We’ve built a delivery platform that takes advantage of the best skills and costs globally.  It’s a platform that maximizes flexibility, enabling us to put our people where the work is.  
The end result is higher utilization and the ability to get optimal pricing while continuing to deliver value to our clients. These changes have contributed to our recent profit performance but more importantly, we will continue to drive structural changes that will result in a more efficient delivery cost base by focusing on ongoing process efficiency and productivity. 
So now I’ll go to a few specifics on the segment results. For Global Technology Services, revenue was up 8% and 5% at constant currency. Short term signings were up 19% at actual rates, while long term signings were down 17%. Our Strategic Outsourcing revenue was up 8%. We had very strong performance in the growth markets, up 21%; however, growth in the major markets moderated as we wrapped on a number of large contracts and we were impacted by the lower level of long term signings over the last few quarters. 
Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 11%.  Signings were up a very strong 19% as the momentum in our ITS key infrastructure plays continues. We had signings growth in all geographies and all sectors. 
Our Global Technology Services pre-tax profit was up 16%, and margin was 11.6%, up 0.8 points year to year. This margin expansion was driven by improved cost structure, a mix to higher offerings in ITS, and year-to-year savings in retirement-related costs. 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was up 7% as reported and 3% at constant currency.  Our revenue growth was impacted by year-to-year declines in two countries. Japan and Australia combined were down 13% at constant currency. The rest of Global Business Services was up 8% at constant currency. Short term signings were up 10% at actual rates.  Signings were up in Europe and Asia but down in the Americas.  
Long term signings were down 16% at actual rates.  In the third quarter last year long term signings for GBS were up more than 85% year to year at actual rates, so it was a very tough compare. 
Global Business Services delivered a record level of profit. Pre-tax profit was up 39% and margin expanded 3.3 points to 14%, their best ever. About 2 points of this improvement was driven by better utilization, pricing, and cost and expense management, with the remainder coming from lower retirement-related costs.  
Turning to Systems & Technology, revenue of $4.4 billion was down 10% year to year, or 11% at constant currency.  We continue to see strong performance in our high-end systems.  Customer demand for virtualization and consolidation drove double-digit revenue growth in System z and high-end System p.  However, this was more than offset by declines in our low-end products and in Storage. 
Building on the momentum established in the first half of the year, System z had another quarter of solid performance.  MIPS grew 49%, and revenue was up 25%, with double-digit growth in all geographies. System z continues to sell very well, even in a tough environment, thanks to its ability to consolidate the workloads done by many different servers onto a single, virtualized platform. 
Specialty MIPS grew over 120% as customers exploit the capabilities of System z to bring new Linux and Java applications to this highly efficient and cost effective platform.  
We are also seeing customers in emerging countries leveraging this platform’s stability and efficiency. For example, the Philippine Savings Bank consolidated seven on-line transaction processing applications, spread across multiple servers to just one Linux partition, resulting in better productivity and energy savings. System z performance reflects its strong value statement in this environment and good sales execution, and we believe we gained market share.  
Converged System p was up 7%, reflecting strong demand for IBM’s virtualization technology and energy-saving capabilities. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, again gaining share and extending its market leadership position. High-end servers were up 19% year to year, and midrange servers were up 21%.  
Legacy System i revenue declined about 80% year to year as we continued to transition our customer base to the converged POWER platform.  This is a very small piece of our portfolio reflecting prior generation technology. 
System x server revenue declined 18% year to year, and blades were down 8%. This quarter’s weakness was driven by sales execution issues, a very competitive pricing environment and a continuation of the slowdown in the X86 market.  We expect to see improvement in the first quarter of next year. 
Our Storage revenue declined 3% year to year after a first half of strong growth. Disk grew 1%, and our high-end DS8000 increased 2% driven by our strong System z performance.  Tape declined 11%, as customers decided to purchase additional media to expand the utilization of their existing devices rather than commit to new capital. 
Gross profit margin in Systems and Technology was down 2.4 points year to year, driven primarily by industry standard servers. Software revenue of $5.2 billion grew 12% year to year, 8% at constant currency. Branded middleware grew 15% year to year to $2.8 billion, and in the quarter comprised 54% of our total software segment revenue. 
Customer demand continues to be focused on software products that generate short term returns and improve operational efficiency.  For instance, our virtualization technology, which is in both our operating systems and Tivoli storage products, sold well in the third quarter. This software helps customers improve utilization and significantly lower data center cost.  
Information management grew 26% year to year as we had strong demand for our relational database products. Our Cognos acquisition was a key driver of the 26% year-to-year growth in our Information Management brand. 
Lotus grew 10% in the quarter, capping its 16th consecutive quarter of growth. Customers are investing to improve their workforce efficiency and drive effective global teaming.  Lotus Notes growth continued and our advanced collaboration technologies had a terrific quarter. 
Rational software grew 23% year to year, fueled by our Telelogic acquisition. With the addition of Telelogic, only Rational can provide a common framework for software and systems delivery across a client’s business. 
Growth in WebSphere and Tivoli was impacted by the slowing growth in the United States and Europe, however both brands enjoyed strong growth in Asia. The annuity nature of our software business provides a predictable and growing stream of profit and cash for IBM. The Software segment pretax income grew 19% year to year to $1.5 billion, even after absorbing acquisition-related items, and PTI margins expanded 1.5 points to 25.9%. 
Turning to IBM’s cash performance, we generated $2.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which was down $500 million from last year’s third quarter, but we were up $1.3 billion year to date. The decline in the current period was primarily driven by working capital.  In particular, our inventory levels increased due to our hardware performance. 
That said, our collections performance was excellent.  DSO improved three days year to year and resulted in the best third quarter DSO level in eight years and our collections remained strong throughout the quarter. 
Through the first three quarters, our free cash flow was $6.4 billion.  As I said, this was up $1.3 billion year to year. Turning to uses for the year, we have invested $6 billion in acquisitions. We’ve also returned $11.8 billion to shareholders.  We bought back over 83 million shares for $9.8 billion, including $2.7 billion this quarter.  And at the end of September we had $6.3 billion remaining from our last board authorization. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with almost $10 billion of cash, flat to June. With liquidity such an important topic, let me spend a minute on IBM’s liquidity position. 
At the end of September, we had $4.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding.  This is down from $5.8 billion at the end of last year.  Our experience in the CP market has been consistent over time. We continue to access the same one to three month tenors and our pricing remains well under LIBOR.  We have not experienced any problems at all accessing the commercial paper market. In addition, we have a $10 billion credit facility available as back-up liquidity.  And last week, we raised $4 billion of term financing which adds to our already significant flexibility. 
We could eliminate our reliance on the CP market if we chose to.  But as I mentioned, our experience has been positive and furthermore, we would expect to have access to the Federal program.  We could use this to reduce term debt maturities in the fourth quarter and next year, so some of this could be pre-funding for those maturities. But in the end, the recent financing simply increases our flexibility. So we have a very strong liquidity position. 
Our non-financing debt was $9.9 billion, and debt-to-cap was 29%. We continue to run our Global Financing business at an appropriate 7.1 to 1 leverage. Let me spend a minute on our Global Financing business. 
In light of recent turmoil in the financial markets, I thought it appropriate to revisit some of the key dynamics of this business. First of all, I think it’s important to understand that the mission of this business is to generate a strong return on equity and to facilitate enterprise clients’ acquisition of IBM hardware, software, and services. Let me put our financing business in the context of overall IBM.   
Global Financing’s revenue in the quarter was about $600 million, or 2.5% of IBM. The segment pre-tax income was almost $350 million, about 9% of IBM’s pre-tax income, and global financing’s external receivables were over $24 billion, about 21% of IBM’s total asset base. Ninety seven percent of the portfolio is in the core competency of technology financing, so there’s nothing exotic in our portfolio.  
So we have a rock solid book of business and very credit-worthy customer base.  About 60% of the portfolio is with investment grade clients, with no exposure to consumers or mortgage lending. 
Looking at the reserve coverage on that client base, we took it up to 1.8% -- that’s an increase of 40 basis points since last year. Of that, the rate of identifiable losses increased from 1.1% to 1.3%, and our rate of anticipated losses increased from 0.3% to 0.5%. 
Now we closely monitor the credit of our clients and adjust as needed.  It’s important to remember that the majority of the assets we’re talking about are in support of critical IT operations and have substantial value. Our leases are non-cancelable and we are financially protected in the event of a merger or acquisition. The assets we finance are critical to major financial institutions. In the event of bankruptcy, leases are often reaffirmed by the bankruptcy courts sustaining our expected lease payments. If necessary, the financed assets can be recovered and resold through our highly refined marketing operations, which extract significant value in the event we have to repossess the equipment. So we have the ability to manage our risks. 
Let me put this in the context of recent events; if you take those same 21 financial institutions that I referenced during the sector discussion, IGF had exposure to ten of them, and we have not been adversely impacted at all. Overall, this is a very solid business and gives us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
Now let me start to wrap up with a discussion of the drivers of our 22% earnings per share growth. We had revenue growth of 5%, including 3 points of currency benefit. At constant mix and margin, this 5% revenue growth contributed $0.08 of year-to-year EPS growth but by far, the biggest driver of our earnings growth was gross margin expansion, led by services and software. 
Gross margin improvement contributed $0.27 of the $0.37 of EPS growth in the quarter. Of that, about $0.09 was due to the year-to-year benefit from our retirement-related plans that flowed to cost. Our expense growth impacted EPS by $0.03, though as I mentioned earlier, our operational expense -- that is, without currency and acquisitions -- was better year to year. 
Our $0.04 cent contribution from share repurchase was less than we’ve seen in the last few quarters, as we wrapped around on the benefit from last year’s accelerated share repurchase. And finally, a 50 basis point year-to-year reduction in our tax rate yielded the last penny. 
When you look at this chart, it’s obvious that the growth came from margin expansion, the result of an ongoing focus on increasing operational efficiencies and good, tactical cost and expense management.   
Before moving on, I want to address one other item that is embedded in the EPS bridge above and that is currency. We report the top line impact from currency each quarter, and we provide an estimate of future quarters based on current spot rates.  Typically, there is not much movement in currency rates over the course of the quarter. We’ve seen this in the last six quarters.  But in the third quarter, we saw a significant strengthening of the dollar and rather than the 6 to 7 point benefit to revenue growth that we would have expected, currency added only 3 points of  year-to-year growth. The difference was $800 million. 
At current spot rates, currency will shift from a tailwind to a headwind.  So in the fourth quarter, as compared to the 3 point benefit to revenue growth we had in the third quarter, at current spot rates we could have a 4 point hurt to revenue growth from currency in the fourth. 
Now in terms of currency impact on EPS, we can’t precisely determine the currency contribution to the bottom line because we don’t know how much of the currency impact is passed on to our customers in price, or how it affected our sourcing decisions. 
In the third quarter, we estimate that currency, net of the hedging activity, was not more than about 20% of our total EPS growth.  But in our experience, pricing and sourcing actions reduce this so you can think of this as a hypothetical upper limit.       
Now, let me wrap up. This is a tough market, but we have a lot of things going for us in this environment. We have a very strong liquidity position.  We have $4.5 billion of commercial paper, with continued access to the market at sub-LIBOR pricing in one to three month maturities, just as we’ve always done. We’ve had absolutely no problems at all with access to the market. 
Now let me reassure you we’re not reliant on CP.  We ended the quarter with nearly $10 billion in cash and we maintain a $10 billion back-up credit facility, so that is $20 billion that we could access at any time. So if we wanted to exit the CP market because of some macro event, we certainly could. And last week, we demonstrated substantial access to the term debt markets by raising an additional $4 billion of cash across five, ten, and thirty year maturities.  We think it’s smart to go long in this environment, if you can. 
So with our cash balance, now enhanced by our recent term debt issuance and our backup credit facility, it is clear we are not reliant on the short term commercial paper markets for funding our business. 
To continue to build our balance sheet, we have a business model that is designed to deliver profit and cash. An important element of that model is our disciplined approach to aligning investments to growth, so just as we aggressively invest in high growth markets, we’re driving productivity from the more established markets.   
We’ve been managing the major markets to deliver productivity for some time.  We have made a lot of progress in our initiatives, but still have a lot of opportunity to continue to improve our balance point. 
Earlier I gave you a few examples of actions we've been taking to optimize our spending profile. Let me give you a flavor of what we're working on going forward. 
In Global Technology Services service delivery we will continue to generate  $1 billion annually in productivity. In addition, we have aggressive plans in place to accelerate our shift of resources to global delivery centers.  In 2009, we plan to increase our global delivery center population by 25%. 
Within our supply chain function, we expect to reduce spending by another $3 billion to $4 billion in 2009. This is consistent with what we’ve done in the past. Now, some of this goes to price and some goes to offsetting the increased labor costs, so not all goes to the bottom line.  Let me give you a couple of specific initiatives we’re working on.
Product design teams will reduce supply chain cost by eliminating redundant components and substituting lower cost alternatives.   
Our procurement team is consolidating the number of suppliers to leverage our spending, and working closely with these suppliers to improve cost and eliminate waste. This work, combined with our investments in decision support tools and improved processes to enable us to optimize our worldwide supplier base, have already identified over $300 million in future savings. 
Now in our Global Support functions, we will continue to expect 5% annual reductions. I've mentioned in the past that within my function, Finance, more than 40% of the function is located in Centers of Excellence both in the US and around the world. Our goal is to improve this to 50% by 2010.   
And other functions are making similar shifts. By 2010, our IT function will increase the number of people in centers of excellence by 17%; HR will increase 9%, and our sales support function will increase 16%.  All of this drives better productivity and efficiency with our functions while enabling us to reach our cost objectives. 
These initiatives are useful in getting you through tough times. This quarter, they helped us to deliver 2 points of gross margin improvement and 4 points of operational expense improvement.  In other words, they paid off on the bottom line. 
And they have another benefit -- they ultimately improve our balance point so that when the market turns, we’ll get better leverage off a leaner cost base. Overall, we feel confident in our ability to deliver at least $8.75 of earnings per share for the full year 2008. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A I’d like to remind you of a couple of items.   First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark’s prepared remarks. Second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions.  When we conclude the Q&A, I’ll turn the call back to Mark for some final remarks.

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup. You may ask your question. 
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
Thanks very much. Thank you very much, Mark, for all the detail today. It’s very helpful. I did want to ask you though, you mentioned that there was some slowing in the hardware business toward the end of the quarter. You do have still a substantial portion of the business that’s transactional. Q4 represents a very large quarter for you and I was just hoping maybe you could summarize while you’ve talked about it throughout the call, summarize what gives you the confidence that you can hit a 305 or 310 number for the fourth quarter, consistent with your guidance of 875 or better for the full year? Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge
Okay, Rich, that’s a very good question. Let me kind of go down this by business unit, so let’s start with our services organization -- first of all, our services organization had a very strong third quarter. You look at that margin performance, in this kind of environment that’s the highest margin as we’ve said that we we’ve had in six years. And if you look at the signings content, those short-terms signings which exhibited themselves most quickly in our mix of business were up 8%. 
So as I look forward and we look at the profile of business, we look at the pipeline, we think that we can continue to move into the fourth quarter on our services base of business at about that same revenue growth and double-digit margin, double-digit profitability growth for both GTS and GBS. 
In addition, let me give you a little color underneath that. If you look at GBS alone and you look at the U.S. base of business that we see in the fourth quarter that we need to sign to achieve our objectives and break that down into deals greater than $20 million, we’ve already been awarded 65% of that pipeline. Now that doesn’t mean it’s signed and completed but for October 16th, for us to have 65% of the deals we need to close, the U.S. GBS business over $20 million already awarded is a pretty strong position. So if you look at the margin, all of the work that we have done on cost take-out and the momentum we have there, I feel quite confident on our own momentum and our profit growth for the services business. 
Now let’s go to software -- in our software business, we had good revenue growth but again, 19% profit growth. And remember, that profit growth is overcoming all of the amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and we get real leverage on that as we go into the fourth quarter. So what’s the pipeline look for software? I went through this with all of the general managers over the weekend and Steve Mills who runs software said this is the best pipeline he’s ever had. Let’s look at the characteristics of that pipeline -- you know, just on a volume base, it’s up 8%. On a dollar basis, it’s up 18%, so in general terms in most times, I’d be looking at -- looking for acceleration on our software business going into the fourth quarter. 
Now this quarter, given the economic issues in the world, we only assume that we have kind of similar characteristics on revenue growth in the fourth quarter from our software business. But if you look at the pipeline, there’s opportunity out there for us to be optimistic and I expect once again for the software business to develop double-digit profit growth in the fourth quarter as well. 
Now let’s go to hardware -- hardware was below our objective but underneath hardware, the higher margin content I think had a pretty strong quarter. Look at Z-series, up 25%, look at the high-end of our P-series content, also up very strong in the quarter. So both of those we expect to have good momentum going into the fourth quarter and good margin. I do expect that the areas that were more problematic, the industry standard content in the third quarter also lag as we go into the fourth but I think we have more than enough momentum in the software services elements of our business, as well as the high-end server content to deliver on our objective of at least 875 for the year. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Rich. Let’s go to the next question, please.

The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein
Thank you. Just a follow-up to that, Mark, if I think about it the other way, it’s obviously a very turbulent market environment and there still is about half your business that is transactional. So the question therefore is what kind of IT spending environment would we need to see for you not to be able to hit your full-year guidance? So if your revenues were down 5% year over year, assuming current currency levels, and IT spending was also down, would you still feel confident in your ability to hit that?
Mark Loughridge
Well you know, Toni, it’s an interesting way to phrase the question because I am sure there’s always an environment that could prove quite challenging towards -- as we enter it so once again, I’ll just go down the elements. I mean, this quarter we delivered strong profit growth without the benefit of the lift we saw in the major markets in the first half of the year. And I think that’s a pretty strong position. So we would have to have major markets fall off much more substantially and we just don’t see that in our load data. 
Again, I’d go back to the comp, the data that we had from both our services organization and our software organization going forward. We’d have to see a dramatic slowdown in our emerging countries but we don’t see that. In fact, if you look at the emerging countries, once again double-digit performance, a strong base of business, Russia up 51%, Brazil up 28%, India up 24%, a little stall I think in China as we grapple with the Olympics but I expect that to come back at the end of the quarter. And I think underneath this, even in a weaker demand environment, Toni, we have put exceptional focus on costs, expense, and margin management. And regardless of what happens in the economic environment, those action plans are going to come through. And if you had to pick one attribute that accounted for those margin performance in the third quarter, it’s that focus on systematic cross take-out across our businesses and their headquarters organization, both the back-office content where we have taken billions out to deliver to the bottom line, our work that we’ve done to take costs out of our service delivery organization, all the work we’ve done to provide more productivity in our sales organization. And it’s that cost take out and systematic margin performance that I think gives us confidence as we go into the fourth. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. Let’s go to the next question.

The next question comes from David Grossman with Thomas Weisel Partners.
David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners
Thanks. Mark, you gave us a lot of information on things that you are doing to drive incremental cost savings into next year. With that said, given the economic and currency backdrop, it’s conceivable revenues could be flattish on a reported basis. So if you take out the pension out of the equation, is it conceivable that margins can still expand in that scenario and can you review for us the key margin headwinds and tailwinds as we enter next year?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. I mean, if you look at the contribution of pension to our gross profit margin in the third quarter, it was about a third so in other words, two-thirds of this was strong operational performance flow-through and I expect that to continue as we go into the fourth quarter and next year. 
As we look at the content in the cost of expense actions that we are taking, they should really continue to support that margin expansion play that we are driving across each of our businesses. I mean, if you look at margin headwinds and tailwinds, I mean really the biggest headwind that we are dealing with overall is the economy, the volatility of currency could be a headwind but if you are talking about just margin in a roll-through, I think the mix of our business is a real tailwind for us. I think our focus on systematically solving our customer problems with real value-add solutions is a real tailwind for us, and I think the momentum that we’ve seen this year also in a difficult economic environment gives us confidence that we can continue to roll out this play. 
Patricia Murphy

The next question comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. Given the sharp moves in the equity and the fixed income markets so far this year, can you help us understand what the help or hurt you expect from pension in 2009 relative to the $700 million year-over-year pretax benefit that you outlined during your analyst meeting?
Mark Loughridge
Sure, and David, I want to go back to how we established the roadmap to begin with. When we first established the roadmap and we said there is $0.90 from that pension contribution cumulatively from ’06 to ‘010, the amount that we were counting on in our ’09 work was about $500 million year to year. Now it did move over time but if you go back to the initial roadmap and what we have been managing to, at that time we thought we would get about $500 million. If you now took that work and updated it for the close of business on September 30th and we looked at the return on assets that we’ve gotten in our U.S. pension fund, which by the way came in about minus 10%. Now that’s certainly not what we were looking for overall but a lot better than the industry because we have about a 43% mix of fixed income, and you also updated for discount rates and other assumptions and return profiles amongst all of our world trade pension funds as well, and if you said well, that’s the profile that we’ll use [to find the] the year and updated all of the performance, then that year-to-year benefit of about $500 million and our base 2010 model would be reduced by about half and would be now about $250 million year to year compared to our ’08 run-rate. Now that doesn’t include the one-time event that we had with the Japan pension fund that we described but that kind of gives you the kind of characteristics.
All of this is dependent on how we turn out at the very end of the year -- you know, what’s the discount rate at the end of the year? What are the return assumptions globally at the end of the year and we’ll update you with how we close out the fourth quarter and what that means as we enter 2009. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Let’s go to the next question. 
Operator
The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital
I guess in clarification of the roadmap, Mark, if you could start and just given what you just said, does the $10 to $11 look possible? And further on that, within the roadmap there is a revenue growth assumption of 3% and then maybe 5% plus in your up scenario to $11. There’s numbers in there of $1.55 as well, in terms of $1.50 in contributions plus in the roadmaps from revenue growth. And in 2002 in a recession you guys declined in revenue, et cetera, so I guess the question is if revenues are flat to declining, which is frankly what all my clients are telling me and won’t believe me if I tell them you are going to grow, what happens to the roadmap? Thanks a lot. 
Mark Loughridge
Ben, I think it’s a very good question. Let’s now go back to the roadmap and how we set that up and what the elements of that roadmap were. 
I think the important aspect of the 2010 roadmap is the granularity of actions that we have at our disposal to achieve that end result. So it’s not just revenue -- it’s revenue, it’s margin and it’s margins submitted, supported by our mix move into higher margin content. It’s margins supported by our aggressive cost take-out plan. It’s share repurchase and its ability to use cash to most support our shareholder base. It’s the momentum that we see in our growth plays, like virtualization, which frankly have exhibited themselves actually more through margin than revenue growth as we’ve gone through the year. And in addition, last within that operational profile, you know, the performance of our acquisitions, which right now if you looked at our acquisition portfolio in its entirety or [inaudible], they are ahead of their profit plan. 
But if you look at all of those and put them together, I don’t think they will all play out exactly as we have laid them out. If you look at it right now, you would have to conclude I think that we are well ahead of track in aggregate and we are ahead of track especially on margin performance. I think we have very strong operational characteristics on margin performance across our business units. We are head of track on share repurchase. I think we’ve done a very good job there. 
The acquisition base that we need to deliver on, we have basically acquired already and I think we can deliver against those profit objectives. The revenue base, you know, we obviously did better on that revenue performance in the first half than we did in third quarter but the third quarter, you could really feel the work on margin coming through. 
So I think if I put all of those characteristics together and we’ll look through the period through ’08, ’09, ‘010, I feel quite confident that operationally we should be able to get to that $10 amount on operational performance and maybe even exceed that. 
And then we also said that whatever pension was that would be additive to our model and at the time, as I explained in the last question, that pension adder in the roadmap was about $0.90. If we now made that same update and we said well let’s take the year ended September 30th, carry all of those metrics and parameters to establish the year, assuming we turn back to more normal position next year, that would take that $0.90 of pension benefit in the 2010 roadmap and reduce it to about $0.50. 
So at that kind of a level, you can see we are still in the same range of $10 to $11, albeit I think the metrics will come potentially through different elements of the roadmap. Some will be stronger and I think over the course of that period from ’06 to ‘010, it’s not going to be a straight line. I mean, there will be stronger periods and periods of less [inaudible], but over the longer term, we feel pretty confident that we have a good game plan to achieve that objective.

The next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Cowen & Company.
Louis Miscioscia - Cowen & Company
Yes, maybe if you could go into a little bit more detail about your X86 server business, or your X-series. Obviously it was very weak. Was it mostly you would say the industry situation or is there something to do with changes around in your product line, and just what you are doing to obviously turn that around? Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge
Sure. First of all, our X86 did lag -- I mean, these clearly were not the results we were looking for and it was I think more characteristic of a couple of things, you know, the industry standard market -- I mean, that’s not the market where we have our best opportunity to show our value-add to our customer base. We are weaker in our hardware base on the more industry standard content. I do think as we go into the fourth quarter, we are going to have opportunity for improved margins on the X86 base, and as we go into ’09, the work that we are doing to improve our sales execution I think will pay off as well and we will be returning to a stronger footing.

The next question comes from Bill Shope with Credit Suisse.
Bill Shope - Credit Suisse
Thank you. Going back to your financing strategy, are you seeing any signs of any material credit constraints for your SMB customers and/or reseller partners? And if so, are you increasing or considering increasing your level of customer/partner financing to counter this?
Mark Loughridge
You know, I think our -- the bulk -- you know, if you looked at that distribution that we showed you on the global financing chart, that’s much more driven by enterprise than it is the small/medium business content. There’s virtually no exposure, as you know, to consumer issues but it’s much more driven by enterprise and as we look at the financing and our partner financing, whether it be support of the partner or the financing through that organization, we are very tough-minded on the credit evaluations and the certainty of repayment regardless of the product opportunity. 
We have a very aggressive and disciplined program to price the risk, again regardless -- a narrow, a skillset that we apply very specifically to technology. We don’t go outside of those white lines and within financing, the strength that we have aside from the ability to assess the credit portfolio quite specifically, the real strength that we have is I think we have some of the best capability to evaluate the take-down curve on technology and evaluate that residual value. And as you all know, the residual value is a very powerful opportunity for us because -- and in the least, we bring that box back, we remanufacture it, we ship it out through either used equipment or equivalent to new and recoup a lot of the value. So it’s a much more operational manufacturing brand driven organization than strictly a financing opportunity. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Bill. Let’s go to the next question.

The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan. 
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan
Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to get a little more context around the services profile, Mark, if I could. You’ve talked about the deal with the pricing environment. I think it’s a little tenuous out there and we are hearing chatter about Western Europe having some difficulties in the outsourcing side. How much of your confidence in the IBM profile is really driven by any sort of marginal increases in the level of recurring revenues in your services business versus perhaps the benefit of your cost takeouts allowing for a much better service platform and a much better economic platform that you can provide to your customers that is allowing you to take share right now?
Mark Loughridge
Well, I think there’s three things that I would say as we go forward on that -- number one, the things that give us confidence is the short-term signings profile and how quickly those short-term signings profile yield as we go into the next quarter. As you have seen throughout the year, we’ve had very good performance on that short-term business and we expect that to yield as we go into the fourth quarter. 
We’ve talked a lot about all the work that we’ve done on cost take-outs but underneath that, I can tell you that we are very encouraged by the gross profit of the business that’s in that backlog. One way to look at it is that frankly, it’s not that difficult in a services business to build a backlog to just drive revenue. But it’s very difficult to do that and reap the kind of margins we are looking for. And so we don’t go after the offering that has terms and conditions or a pricing structure that we know won’t yield over the course of the contract. I mean, we get requests for the terms and conditions -- like in Europe, we had a request for a large deal and they simply asked us to take over their pension base [inaudible] population -- well you know, I don’t want a pension base in Europe. I’ve got a lot of experience with pension and I don’t need anymore pension base in Europe, so we turned that contract down. 
Would it have expanded signings? Yes, but it would not have expanded gross profit. And we’ve had requests for unlimited liability for data security breaches in a contract in the U.S., even though the customer wasn’t willing to install the needed security measures and products from our portfolio. Now, why would I do that? In that case, the customer is really looking for an insurance policy. I mean, we’re not here to write insurance policies just to drive signings. 
So underneath this, it’s really the confidence in the quality of the deals that we’ve signed I think moving into the fourth quarter. And then last, I would reiterate we see good pipeline and I would go back, as an example, in the GVS pipeline, I just thought it was quite powerful that we’ve already been awarded about 65% of the deals greater than $20 million that we needed. 
So obviously in all of this, there’s a lot of work we need to do to get through the fourth quarter. We’ve got to continue to take costs out, we’ve got to yield on the signings, we’ve got to drive margins, we’ve got to maintain discipline in the business. But I think we’ve got a good footing again as we go into the fourth. 
Patricia Murphy

The next question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank

Thanks very much. Just to follow-up on that last question, it looks like backlog deteriorated sequentially for the second consecutive quarter. Can you provide some color around that deterioration in the backlog?
And secondly, has the pricing environment changed significantly in the past several months? And to what extent has the HP/EDS deal had on the competitive environment overall? Thanks a lot. 
Mark Loughridge
Sure. I would not say that the pricing environment has changed over the last couple of months. It certainly didn’t become more difficult as we went through the quarter. I mean, one interesting fact on those short-term signings performance as we progress through the quarter, they in fact accelerated as we went into September. I mean, sometimes I think we’ve looked at this and say well there must have been deceleration in the month of September. Well in short-term signings, we had pretty good growth in the quarter but they definitely accelerated as we went into September so I don’t think they would have accelerated had we had real pricing pressure as we exited the third. 
And as far as the erosion you saw this quarter, you know it’s still within historical norms. It can be a bit like signings. It’s not very consistent across quarters. We always have some level of terminations, re-scope and adjusted volume so I didn’t see any distinct trend this quarter. 
And as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we see enough opportunity for us to continue to grow our short-term signings across the services business and in fact grow our long-term signings as well. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Chris. Let’s take one more question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. 
 
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets 
Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about mix, in that is it your impression given the environment that hardware will continue to exhibit negative growth rates in this and subsequent quarters? And then related, how does that make you think about the cash flow, because the cash flow I thought was a little disappointing this quarter? Does that come back in Q4? Thanks very much. 
Mark Loughridge
I think that’s a good question. You know, the cash flow issue that you mentioned in the third quarter was really in some sense driven by hardware and within hardware, there was some inventory build-up as we move into the fourth quarter as well. But you know, when you look at the mix of business going into the fourth quarter, I would remind you that we had very good growth in our Z-series platform, in our high-end T-series platform, where we have unique value and actually our best margin performance. And I think that is likely to maintain a fairly consistent mix as we go into the fourth. 
I do think that the industry standard content, which for us is not where we show our best value proposition and it doesn’t have the margin inherent in it to begin with, would probably continue to be a challenging environment within the fourth quarter. 
Now the mix clearly is going to have a strong component of this highly profitable services business. I mean, we had the highest margins we’ve had in six years and I think a very strong mix of highly profitable software content, given the pipeline that we see going into the fourth. 
So let me thank you for those questions and let me take the opportunity now to just close up. 
Now I hope that there were a number of things that you took away from this call. There are obviously some very specific points we wanted to make, which I would like to summarize. Number one, we have a manageable level of exposure I think to the large financial institutions that have been impacted by the financial crisis. We kind of explain this as you look across that industry because we have 75% of our business in fact outside of the U.S. But another interesting statistic if you look at it, the breadth of the opportunity in the financial services sector, at least by the analysis that we have seen, if you in fact ranked the largest banks based on assets globally and you looked at those top 50 banks, really only four after the consolidations, or I would say five to four are in the top 50 are in the U.S. Well, what portion of those are in the top 10 -- it’s really only one after the consolidation. 
I just give that as an example of how broad this financial services sector opportunity is and I think you could see that in those pie charts that we gave you, where really the exposure in both revenue and AR were -- for both of those in the 1% area. 
Secondly, I think our financing business is in a very solid footing. As I have said earlier, it’s kind of a narrow mission. We don’t get outside those white lines where I think we have a tremendous skill set. We do aggressively manage those residual values in the risk profile of our business and I would add that we look at the end of lease as another business opportunity to what we would call remanufacturing, which has its own challenges because you have to take the content that you are taking out of the back of that truck when the lease is over and renew that and match it to demand and we do that. If you looked at our financing IT structure, you would find that the most sophisticated software that we have installed is in fact aimed at the back-end of the lease, not the front-end of the lease for that reason. 
I think we have very good access to the CT markets. I can honestly tell you we have not had problem asking the CT market at all this year. It’s a very good source of financing leverage for us. But we are not dependent on it. I mean, we have about $4.5 billion right now but if you look at our opportunity otherwise, we have $10 billion of cash. We’ve got another $10 billion in our revolver. I mean, clearly if there were to be a problem in commercial paper, we could source from some of those other areas. But I personally, I do not think that the IBM Corporation is going to have a problem accessing commercial paper. 
We have a great portfolio of products. We talked about that. I think it’s not just the portfolio of products we enter the year with but the solutions aimed at solving our customers’ problems on cost management, on capital conservation, on risk and compliance, all the elements to help us continue to drive short-term signings up 8% and if you then said well within the financial services sector, what did short-term signings grow? In the third quarter globally they were up 12%. In the U.S., financial services sector short-term signings were up 33%. I think that’s a function of the solutions and how we’ve oriented to solving our customers’ challenges in this environment. 
So I guess to conclude, we are focused on the things we can control. We think we have shown real momentum, especially in that margin performance in the third quarter and we are confident as we go into the fourth quarter and 2009. 
So I want to thank you again as we conclude the call.

Now, I’ll turn the call over to Mark Loughridge. 
Mark Loughridge
Thanks for joining us today. To start the call, I’ve got to say that this is one of the best quarters I’ve ever seen and remember, we delivered an outstanding second quarter a year ago, so these are truly powerful results. To drive these results, we’ve been executing a strategy that aligns investments to growth opportunities.  In the emerging markets, we’ve been investing to capture the opportunity created from the build-out of the infrastructures in these high growth economies, while in the more established markets we’re managing our business for productivity and we’re delivering solutions that provide value to our clients. In this environment, our customers are looking for ways to save cost, conserve capital, and manage risk.   
 
With this strategy, this quarter we performed better than ever and it shows in our results, with almost $27 billion in revenue, up 13% or 6% at constant currency, earnings per share growth of 28%, and free cash flow up almost $1 billion year to year.  
 
When we get into the details, you’ll see that growth improved in all three of the geographies at constant currency, led by Europe.  We also had better performance in software and systems, with systems getting a boost from our mainframe and POWER6 product ramps.  At the same time, our services momentum continued with great revenue growth, signings growth, and margin expansion. 
 
Now, while Services has been delivering strong growth, it is also an important element of our annuity businesses.  About half of IBM’s revenue is from annuity businesses, which provide a solid base of revenue and cash.  Our performance this quarter reflects the strength of IBM’s unique business model, delivering breakthrough technologies and business know-how to our clients, built for both emerging and established markets.  
So, we had a strong quarter, and first half.  In April, I told you we expected full year 2008 earnings per share of at least $8.50.  Now, after the second quarter, we’re taking our view of the year up by another $0.25 and we now expect earnings per share of at least $8.75, which is a growth of at least 22% over 2007 reported results. Since the beginning of the year, we’ve increased EPS expectations by $0.85.  
So now let’s turn to the financial summary. Our revenue of $26.8 billion is up 13% as reported, and 6% at constant currency. Now these would be strong results in any economy, let alone today’s dynamic global environment, but as I mentioned, a year ago we had a strong second quarter with 6% constant currency growth.  So this is outstanding growth compared to an equally powerful quarter last year. 
 
You’ll see the benefit of our operating leverage throughout the entire P&L.  Gross margin expanded 1.4 points, led by services and systems.  Pre-tax income dollars grew 21%, and PTI margin expanded 1 point.  And with a half-point improvement in our tax rate, net income grew 22% and margin expanded to 10.3%.   
 
Bottom line, we delivered $1.98 of EPS, up 28% year to year over our reported results last year.  You’ll remember last year we had an $80 million pretax gain for the sale of our printer business, which was $0.05 per share.  So without the second quarter ‘07 gain, which I know is the way you view our business, our earnings per share was up 32%.   
 
So now, let’s get into the details of the quarter, starting with three different views of revenue. Growth in all geographies accelerated from last quarter. At constant currency, Americas was up 6%, Europe up 7%, and Asia-Pacific up 6%, so growth not only accelerated but was also very consistent across the geographies. In the established countries, which we address through our major markets organization, our value proposition and our new technologies fueled strong growth.   
 
The U.S. had another very good quarter, up 5%, and Canada accelerated to 11% growth at constant currency. In Europe, at constant currency Germany was up 7%, France was up 6%, Italy up 5%, and the U.K. up 4%.  And while Japan was down year to year, it did improve modestly from last quarter.  
 
Our performance in the emerging markets also accelerated.  We address the emerging markets through our new “growth markets” organization.  These countries represented 18% of IBM’s geographic revenue in the quarter and together grew 21% as reported and 14% at constant currency.  And the BRIC countries subset grew 31%, or 20% at constant currency. This was led by explosive growth in India.    
 
Now I want to take a minute to show you our performance on this basis for the first half.  These countries coded in blue represent our major markets organization, which as I just mentioned address the more established markets.  The countries coded in green comprise our growth markets organization.  The countries in darker green each grew at greater than 10% in local currency.  I think this makes it clear that our growth markets organization covers a lot more than just the BRIC countries, across Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia.  The base is large and for the first half, these countries represent 17% of our revenue and they’re growing rapidly, collectively up 13% year to year. 
 
Now let me give you a couple of examples of the kinds of things we are doing in with our clients in these emerging markets. In the Czech Republic, we are helping the Ministry of Finance automate their tax systems.  In Russia, we have consolidated the settlement systems for the Central Bank of Russia and provided a centralized disaster recovery solution.  In addition, our Information Warehouse and Cognos products were selected as the platform to analyze each member bank’s compliance with various regulations, like Basel II.  And in China, we are partnering with one of the country’s largest real estate companies to construct a new financial management system to meet the needs of a rapidly growing enterprise.  
 
So we’re not just selling products -- we’re selling major backbone solutions as these high growth economies build out their infrastructure, and we expect these rapidly growing markets to continue to fuel IBM’s revenue and profit engine in the second half of 2008 and into the future.     
Now I’ll give you a snapshot of revenue by sector. Revenue from our industry sales units was up 14%, or 7% at constant currency.  All sectors grew, again led by the Communications sector.  It’s the second consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth for Communications, with continued strength in the Telecom and Utilities industries. 
 
Our worldwide Financial Services growth accelerated to 15% growth, or 6% at constant currency.  Now, while the U.S. revenue was down 2%, outside the U.S., where we have about 75% of our business, revenue was up 22%, or 9% at constant currency. Financial Services results were in line with our total sector performance for the third consecutive quarter and overall we believe we gained share this quarter.   
 
Revenue from our small and medium business clients increased 13%, or 6% at constant currency, driven by continued strength in the growth markets, which were up 15% in local currency. In the major markets, our SMB business returned to growth, with good acceptance of our new System p offering and broad-based growth in our software portfolio. 
 
So now let’s look at our revenue by segment. Our two services segments had another great quarter.  Our success was broad-based, with double-digit growth in all lines of business. Software growth improved to 17%, compared to a great second quarter of last year. In Systems and Technology, Systems improved to 10% growth, led by outstanding performance in our high-end servers. In Global Financing, while the overall growth was impacted by a decline in the sales of used equipment, our financing revenue was up year to year.  
So now let’s turn to expense. Total expense and other income increased 15%.  With 13% revenue growth, our expense-to-revenue ratio was up about 40 basis points year to year. Now peeling back the 15% growth in expense, approximately eight points of growth was due to currency and we estimate that six points of growth is from acquisitions, with a full quarter of Cognos and Telelogic spending.  So operational expense was flat year to year.  Now within this, we covered interest expense from our ASR, which impacted our expense growth by almost a point.  
 
But we’re not taking a mallet to our spending to keep the operational expense flat; we’re executing our investment strategy and allocating our spending to areas where we see the best opportunity.  For example, this quarter, our operational SG&A expense, that’s without currency and acquisitions, was flat.  In our growth markets, where we’re investing to capture the fast growing opportunity, SG&A was up about 12% while the rest of the world was down 1%.   
 
So let me give you a couple of examples of the kinds of investments we’re making in the growth markets organization.  In Vietnam, we established a sales team to pioneer System z and won our first mainframe account in June at a Vietnamese bank.  In Latin America, we’re adding resources to regional cities in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina to reach out to our small and medium business clients.  In Bangalore, we created the Systems Solution Center to provide proof of concept and training to our customers.  
So we’ve been focused on the strategy of aligning our investments to growth for some time and I think you’ll agree it’s really paying off.   
 
Now before we move on to margins, I’ll comment on the items that significantly impacted our profit growth this quarter. First, retirement-related plans generated about $380 million of cost and expense in the quarter for a savings of about $250 million year to year.  But pension is just one category of compensation.  When you look at all forms of compensation, salary, bonus, equity awards, retirement-related plans, our total compensation is up about $800 million year to year.   
 
AR provisions were up about $60 million, driven by a higher level of receivables and additional reserves for specific customers. This increased our coverage by 10 basis points from the first quarter to 1.7%. And within other income and expense, there are a couple of items that drove the higher level of expense. First, while our cash balance remains strong, decreasing interest rates resulted in a reduction to interest income of about $50 million; and second, let’s look at the impact from our hedging programs.  We hedge the major cash flows to mitigate the effect of currency volatility as we manage our cash globally.  The impact of these hedging programs is reflected principally in other income and expense and cost of goods sold.  This quarter, these hedging losses in other income and expense were higher year to year by almost $90 million.   
 
Now let’s turn to margins. We had broad-based margin expansion again this quarter, led by increases in both services segments. Our software gross margin declined as we integrated Cognos and Telelogic but good productivity drove expansion in pretax margin. And with improving revenue dynamics due to a strong acceptance of our high-end systems products, both gross and pretax margin improved in the Systems and Technology segment.  
 
So now let’s turn to the segments, starting with Services. Our two Global Services segments continued their momentum and delivered powerful results again this quarter. Total Services revenue was $15.2 billion, up 16% as reported and 8% at constant currency. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that Global Services revenue growth has been above our longer term objectives.   
 
Signings were $14.7 billion at actual rates, up 12%; while at constant currency signings were $12.2 billion, up 4% year to year.  Our short-term signings were up 18% at actual rates and up 9% at constant currency, while long-term signings were up 7% at actual rates and were flat at constant currency.  We signed 13 deals larger than $100 million and our backlog was an estimated $117 billion at constant currency, up $1 billion year to year.   
 
The demand environment was very consistent with first quarter.  In the growth markets, where clients are focused on infrastructure build-out and growth opportunities, we’ve had good performance in both long- and short-term signings. At constant currency, long-term signings are up over 70% and short-term up 25%.   
 
In the major markets, clients continue to favor solutions that deliver shorter time to value.  We’ve seen good results in the shorter term businesses, with signings up 7% at constant currency, including the U.S., which was up a very strong 17%.  Long-term signings in major markets were down 10% at constant currency. So you can see that these results validate our strategy for both emerging and more established markets.  
The emerging markets are focused on longer term infrastructure plays. For example, Idea Cellular, one of the top five telecom providers in India, strengthened its relationship with IBM by awarding GTS additional scope this quarter.  This includes support for geographic expansion, new transformation projects, and a further scaling of the current infrastructure to enable the company’s rapid growth.   
 
In the more established markets, our offerings that drive cost savings and time to value are vital to our clients in this environment.  For example, this quarter GBS was awarded a contract to help transform Pfizer’s manufacturing organization into a globally integrated, agile, and demand-driven supply network.  IBM will provide business process design, systems integration, and application support focused on new common business processes to reduce costs and improve supply chain operations. 
So these results are being driven by offerings that work well in each of these very different environments. 
 
So now I’ll give you some specifics on the segment results. For Global Technology Services, revenue was up 15% and 8% at constant currency.  We had double-digit growth in all lines of business. Signings were up 14% at actual rates, with short-term up 16% and long-term up 13%.  At constant currency, GTS signings were up 9% and in fact, both short-term and long-term were up 9% as well.   
 
Our Strategic Outsourcing revenue was up 13%, driven by prior year signings and continued growth in our base accounts. Business Transformation Outsourcing was up 29% as reported.  We had double-digit revenue growth in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, and our BPO Daksh business continued to grow at double-digits. 
 
Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 16%.  The momentum in our ITS key infrastructure plays continues. 
Now, the last couple of quarters, I’ve highlighted our success in Green Data Center offerings and in the second quarter, we signed another $220 million of Green Data Center business. Today I’ll highlight another area, Converged Communications, which helps our clients address increasing costs associated with managing and maintaining separate voice and data networks and equipment.   
 
Converged Communications signings were up 65% over the first quarter. I think this is a very good example of where customers are spending to lower costs in the short-term and to drive a lower total cost of ownership. These key plays represent about a quarter of ITS total signings and were up 14% quarter to quarter.   
 
Maintenance revenue was up 16%.  This includes two months of revenue for the services provided to Ricoh Info Print.  This work transitioned to Ricoh in June. Our Global Technology Services pre-tax profit was up 26% and margin was 9.5%, up nine-tenths of a point year to year. This margin expansion was a result of the improved cost structure driven by productivity in last year’s restructuring, a mix to higher value products in ITS, and year-to-year savings in retirement-related costs.  
 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was up 18% as reported and up 9% at constant currency. We grew revenue double-digits in all geographies and all sectors.  Total signings were up 9% at actual rates and down 2% at constant currency. Within that, short term signings were up 19% at actual rates and 9% at constant currency. Our clients continue to be motivated by projects with shorter-term paybacks and ones that preserve cash and drive cost savings. 
Examples are projects that help our clients manage global deployments and integration, create shared services, and replace legacy systems. These cost savings and efficiency offerings represent over two-thirds of our short term signings on a global basis and almost 90% in the Americas. We’re also seeing good demand for offerings that help clients meet regulatory requirements through improved compliance and governance, as well as drive innovation in new markets.  
For GBS, long-term signings were down 9% at actual rates and down 20% at constant currency but remember in second quarter last year, long-term signings for GBS were up 70% year to year, so this was a very tough compare for them. 
 
Global Business Services pre-tax profit was up 31% and margin expanded 1.5 points to 11.9%.  GBS delivered record levels of pretax dollars and margin this quarter.  The improvement was primarily driven by increased utilization, good contract management, and lower retirement-related costs. 
Systems & Technology revenue of $5.2 billion was up 2% year to year.  Our systems business grew 10%, or 4% at constant currency, driven by double-digit growth in System z, POWER systems, and storage. Customers continue to leverage the fast payback from IT efficiencies driven by virtualization and consolidation into high-end systems. 
 
System z revenue was up 32% year to year and MIPS grew 34%, gaining market share.  The new System z10 Enterprise Class Server has been extremely well-received in the marketplace since our announcement at the end of February.  Customers are leveraging the z10 to reduce their technology and energy costs as they simplify their data centers.   
 
We entered the second quarter with a strong deal pipeline and this quarter, frankly, we were sold out.  Performance was particularly strong in the Americas and Europe, as well as in the Financial Services Sector.  We also shipped a record number of specialty engines this quarter, as our customers and partners are continuing to bring new applications to the mainframe. Our legacy System i revenue declined 47% in the quarter, as we transition our System i customer base to the converged POWER platform. 
 
Converged System p had an outstanding quarter, growing 29%, gaining share and extending its market leadership position.  Last quarter we had growth of almost 60% in our midrange servers; this quarter we accelerated midrange growth to 68%.  
 
High-end servers grew 21%, driven by the new POWER6 595 announced early in the second quarter. The 595 server running AIX became the first and only server to achieve more than 6 million transactions per minute, offering customers nearly three times the performance per processor core of an HP Superdome at a lower cost. With POWER6 performance now available across the entire product line, this platform is well-positioned to sustain its technical and market leadership as we enter the second half. 
 
System x server revenue declined 5% year to year. While both high-end servers and Blades grew double-digits, we experienced continued softness in the low-end.  
 
Storage revenue was up 12% year to year and gained share.  Total disk was up 20%, as we had double-digit growth in enterprise disk on continued strength of the DS8000, which was up 24%.  We also had strong performance in mid-range and low-end disk, growing 28%. Tape declined 2% as customers paused in advance of our new high-end product which we announced earlier this week.  We believe we held share in tape. 
Microelectronics OEM revenue was down 19%, but overall, Systems and Technology pretax income improved 21%.  Margins, both gross and pretax, improved over a point, reflecting our ongoing shift to higher value as customers virtualize their IT environments. 
Our software business generated $5.6 billion in revenue and growth accelerated to 17%, or 9% at constant currency. Our branded middleware products grew 21% year to year and now account for 55% of our total software revenue.   
 
Customer buying priorities in the second quarter were similar to the first quarter and fall into three broad categories. First, customers purchased software that can improve their own cost effectiveness and business performance.  The advanced virtualization technologies found in our Z and P operating systems are good examples of this. Our WebSphere products continued to grow as customers use the power of the Web to lower their cost and expand their reach.   
 
Information Management products provided Information on-demand to help improve business performance.  Information Management grew 30% in the quarter.  This was fueled by our Cognos acquisition as well as over 30% growth in distributed relational database. 
 
The second customer priority is driven by regulatory requirements.  Tivoli security and storage management products address this need and both grew double digits in the second quarter.  This was our 15th consecutive quarter of strong growth in storage management software. 
 
And third, customers continued to invest to improve the personal productivity of their workforce, this was clearly demonstrated by the growth in our Lotus family. Lotus had a terrific quarter, with 21% growth marked by a series of competitive wins in both growth and established markets. For example, a major bank in Asia licensed over 300,000 Lotus seats.  The bank recognized the rich out-of-the-box capabilities of Lotus Notes as well as the long-term product strategy. 
 
Software tooling also increases workforce productivity, and our Rational portfolio holds a unique position in the market. With the addition of Telelogic, IBM has the software tooling to support both applications and embedded system development.  Rational grew 37% year to year. 
 
Software segment profit grew 19% in the quarter, and this includes the absorption of acquisition-related cost and expense. With this profit growth, pretax margin expanded to 23.7%. 
 
Turning to IBM’s cash performance, we generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. This is up $1 billion year to year and was driven by growth in net income, improvement in working capital, and outstanding DSO performance.  In fact, DSO improved 1.1 days year to year.  And we had a great first half, with free cash flow of $4.3 billion, up $1.8 billion year to year.   
 
Now turning to uses, we’ve invested $2.4 billion in net capital expenditures and $5.9 billion in acquisitions to acquire 13 companies, including Cognos and Telelogic.    
We’ve also returned a very significant amount to shareholders, $8.4 billion, through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  In the first half, we paid out $1.2 billion in dividends and in April, we announced a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend.  We have now increased the dividend by 150% in the last three years, and we bought back 62 million shares for $7.2 billion year to date, including $4.7 billion this quarter.  At the end of June we had $8.9 billion remaining from our last board authorization.  
 
I’d like to also note that during the quarter, we achieved a real milestone.  Since the inception of our share repurchase program in the mid-90s, we’ve invested over $100 billion to repurchase shares at an average price of $69 per share, so this has been a very effective investment.     
 
So now let's turn to the balance sheet -- we finished the second quarter with a strong cash balance of $9.8 billion. Our non-financing debt was $9.1 billion, and debt-to-cap was 27%, essentially flat from last quarter and down from a peak of 47% at the end of the second quarter of 2007. The remaining three-quarters of $34.2 billion of debt is to support our Global Financing business, which is leveraged at 6.8 to 1. 
 
We continue to have seamless access to global capital markets at very competitive rates.   This quarter, we capitalized on our global reach by raising debt from U.S., Swiss and Japanese capital markets.  We issued a $1.5 billion U.S. extendible, a 500 million Swiss Franc bond, and a 50 billion Yen syndicated loan. The balance sheet remains very strong and well-positioned to support the business over long term. 
 
So let’s start to wrap up with a discussion of the drivers of our 28% earnings per share growth. We had revenue growth of 13%, including 7 points of currency benefit.  At constant mix and margin, this 13% revenue growth contributed $0.20 of the $0.43 of year to year EPS growth. We again expanded our gross margin, led by services and systems.  This contributed another $0.19.  Of that, about $0.08 was due to the year-to-year benefit from our retirement-related plans that flowed to cost. Our expense growth impacted EPS by $0.04, though as I mentioned earlier this was driven by currency and acquisitions. And we generated a benefit of $0.09 from our aggressive share repurchases over the last year, mitigated slightly by the additional interest expense related to last year’s ASR. And finally, a 100 basis point reduction in our tax rate yielded the last penny.   
Now I think it’s obvious, but we achieved all of this with the U.S. economy as a headwind and currency as a tailwind.  But bottom line, the IBM business really executed this quarter.     
Our business model is designed to capture the opportunity and drive solid profit and cash in a global environment. In emerging markets, growth is fueled by infrastructure build-out.  We’ve got a lot of experience in this area and we’re investing to capture this massive opportunity.  In the second quarter, countries in our growth markets organization grew 21%, or 14% at local currency, and made up 18% of our geographic revenue base.   
 
This quarter, we also had strong performance in the established countries. As an example, the G7 countries collectively grew 5% at constant currency.  We weren’t counting on this kind of growth, so with a focus on productivity, this provided real leverage to the bottom line.   
 
In the established markets, demand was high for offerings that provided cost savings, conserve capital, and deliver a faster payback on investment.  Clients are also looking for offerings that address specific needs such as energy savings, security and resilience, and risk and compliance. 
The advantage of having a high value services business is that we can adapt our offerings to meet clients’ needs. We’re also continuously investing to extend our technology leadership, such as our new System z, introduction of POWER6 to our server lines, and new releases of advanced social networking software.   
 
And finally, this quarter we once again leveraged our financial strength.  We have significant annuity content, which provides stability to the model.  We expanded pretax margin by a point as we focus on driving productivity in our own business. We generated $1 billion more free cash flow year to year, proving that we can convert our profit to cash, and with debt-to-cap now at 27% and almost $10 billion of cash on hand, we have substantial flexibility to make investments where we see the best opportunities. 
You put all of this together, and we call it “The IBM Difference”. 
 
So we had a very strong quarter and first half and based on this performance, we’re taking our view of the year up by another $0.25 and we now expect earnings per share of at least $8.75, which is growth of at least 22% over 2007 reported results.  With this strong performance, we are well on track to our 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 of earnings per share. 
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to remind you of a couple of items.  First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark’s prepared remarks. Second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I’ll turn the call back to Mark for some final remarks.

(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein
Thank you. Mark, I was wondering if you could comment on the forces at work in the services business and how we should think about them. When I think about them, your signings actually accelerated both long-term and short-term this quarter. That’s a positive. Looking to the second half, you’re comparisons in terms of revenue growth become more difficult and the benefit from currency, assuming constant spot rate, also becomes less advantageous. So when we put that together, you’ve been doing 16%, 17% revenue growth, reported revenue growth in services in the first half. Should we still be thinking about a double-digit kind of revenue growth number for global services in the second half? And can you comment on the forces at work?
Mark Loughridge
Sure, I’d be glad to. First of all, as we look at the services business going into the second half, we see both GBS and GTS performing well within their model, and remember their model is 6% to 8% revenue growth, so even with a diminished amount from currency, we should be in double-digit revenue performance. 
Now, we’re quite encouraged by our services business. I mean, we’ve have very strong performance for a number of quarters on our short-term signing basis. I personally was very impressed with our long-term signing performance in the quarter, especially in GTS, so I think we entered the second half with a lot of momentum and we have a good deal list as we go into the second half as well. 
Now, you are quite correct -- we do wrap-on power performance. We’ve had four sequential quarters where services outperformed their model objectives, but we have a very good book of business, good momentum, and we had strong signings performance in the quarter as we move into the second half.

Our next question comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you very much. While the compounded earnings growth between ’06 and 2010 is 14% to 16%. Of the new 2008 target, the compounded growth is only 7% to 12% over the next couple of years. Is there any reason that we should expect your earnings growth to slow over the next two years, or should the $10 to $11 move higher?
Mark Loughridge
Well, I think that’s a -- that is what I would call a high quality problem. I mean, right now if you looked at our performance along that track, it’s difficult not to say we’re ahead of track. I’m not going to give a longer term forecast today. We’ll do that at the end of the year once we’ve completed the year and get ready for the -- our annual analyst meeting but I quite agree with you; I’m very encouraged by our performance and looking at that performance going forward, you know, I would have to admit that we are ahead of track and we feel like we’ve got a very strong half to 2008 ahead of us as well. So no debate there -- I think we’ve got a good level of performance right now. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
Thank you. Tough to find anything to really question but could you, Mark, maybe talk about anything unusual in terms of linearity in the quarter? Also, could you talk about what you are seeing in terms of any elongation in sales cycles, or more layers of approval, more stringent approval processes required to get deals done in the current environment?
Mark Loughridge
Sure, well the first -- to answer your first point about trends within the quarter, the second quarter was very characteristic to the kind of monthly skew that we saw in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Frankly, it’s kind of an encouraging trend from my perspective because we see more business as we try to move the skew of business to early in the quarter, rather than all in the third month of the quarter. And I think that is part of our management system and an increased mix of services. But if you look at the characteristics of the second quarter compared to what we saw in the first quarter or compared to what we saw in the fourth quarter, it was a very typical trend month to month. 
Now on your second part on longer sales cycles and changes in approval, in the -- I would say more characteristic in the long-term business, we’ve seen some changes in approval and customers being very diligent about this, especially in the -- more the G7 major market countries, but I think we’ve been wrestling with this for some time so I’m not sure I would say that’s a difference in trend. I think customers have been looking carefully at their contract basis for some time and from my perspective, I didn’t see a change in that trend as we went into the second quarter. And we had good closure on our software base as we closed out the quarter. We did have both in software and services a number of contracts roll over the date line into the third quarter, but again I don’t think we saw anything unusual in that trend. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Jeff Fidacaro with Merrill Lynch.
Jeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch
I was wondering if you could talk about the buy-backs, about $4.7 billion in the quarter was a little bit ahead of our expectations. Could you discuss the priorities for use of cash and comment on thoughts of acquisitions here as we’ve seen the market pull back a bit? Do you see valuations attractive?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. First of all, let’s put this in the perspective of how we utilize our cash and how we prioritize the use of that cash. Well, first of all, it’s investing in the business and I -- I have to admit, since I’ve been in this job and even back when I was the controller, so now we’re talking a decade but we have never turned down a big capital investment in the business because we were allocating cash. We always had enough cash to invest in the business. Now, we have turned away from investments if they didn’t meet our financial objectives, they didn’t meet our IRR or payback or didn’t seem to be part of our overarching strategy. And we’re quite financially disciplined about that, so if it doesn’t meet the financial objectives, we generally don’t make that expenditure. But we do prioritize investing in the business first. 
After that, acquisitions play a very strong part. Now you’ve seen that we’ve just completed some very big acquisitions with Cognos and Telelogic which we are integrating in the business, but at today’s prices there are also some very attractive candidates out there. We are sticking to our strategy of scalable intellectual property and I think that has turned out to be the right approach for acquisitions. 
That then brings us to the dividend; obviously we’re very committed to that dividend, which we’ve increased substantially over the last three years. And if you look at share buy-back, we repurchased $19 billion last year. We got the authorization from the board this year for $15 billion, of which $12 billion would be in the year, and that is a very logical -- that is a very logical objective for us.

Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Lehman Brothers.
Ben Reitzes - Lehman Brothers
Thank you. I was hoping to I guess talk about hardware; the p and z momentum very significant in the quarter. I was wondering if you thought that could continue into the back half, Mark. How many quarters cycle is it in mainframe and p do you think we should be looking for? Typically in the past it’s been anywhere from two to four quarters of strong growth in the mainframe cycle, so I’m wondering what you think there and how that’s impacting the business. Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge
Sure. z Series -- obviously very pleased with the z Series performance, up 32% and it’s an extrapolation I think of the momentum that we saw in the first quarter. Remember the first quarter we only had this box for a month, so I think it’s a pretty logical relationship from first to second. 
As you look at it going forward, number one as we close out the second quarter, we were sold out. So there is still much more demand as we move into the second and we are now facing what is relatively, as you remember, an easy compare in the third and the fourth, so as I look at z Series going to the second half, I think it’s a very strong play for us. 
As far as your question what we think that overall z Series cycle is going to be like, I think it will be much more similar to what we saw with the z9 cycle -- in other words, a longer cycle with less spiky behavior across the initial phases of that rollout and a more sustainable longer term cycle for us. 
As far as p Series, boy, this was a terrific performance, up 29%. And interestingly, if you look underneath it, remember last quarter we said mid-range p was up 60%? This quarter, mid-range p was up 68%. High-end p, where we now introduced the POWER6 architecture that we had for the full quarter, is up 21%, so the p Series performance was very, very powerful. And we see strong demand for that, both in the major markets but very strong demand for p Series as well in the emerging growth markets. So I think there’s a lot of opportunity for the p Series. 
If you look at p Series, we’ve got about 36 points of share on that. We picked up 17 points over the last seven years, and that leaves us about 64 points to go, so we’re pretty bullish about p Series performance. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Cowen & Company.
Louis Miscioscia - Cowen & Company
Continuing on with the hardware line, if you could maybe comment a little bit more about System x in the sense of you already had mentioned on the call that the high-end in blades were good and obviously that might be due to virtualization, but I thought that you would actually see enough strength there to actually lift that as the impression is that there’s a lot of very big companies that are rolling out virtualization. We think that the whole group would actually see a revenue lift. Maybe if you could just explain what’s going on under the covers. 
Mark Loughridge
Sure, I’d be happy to. When we look at x Series performance, I mean, obviously we think we could’ve done better in x Series and we do think there’s some execution sales issues that we need to address as we go into the second half, but I think if you step back from this and look at the performance, remember that on the x Series, the high-end x grew 23%, blades grew 14%, so we saw pretty good high-end growth rates on the x Series base. 
As I look at it, I think that’s in a way characteristic of a virtualized environment and if you look at it more across the entire product line, as we had indicated in the analyst meeting, as an environment virtualizes, they favor a higher end mix of servers, and that’s a part of the industry where we have a commanding position and I think you saw that in the quarter -- very high growth rates on z, very high growth rates on p, good growth rates on the high-end of x -- all, again in my opinion, characteristic of a customer environment that’s virtualizing. And that virtualizing capability really expands as you move up the product line. You know, if you look at the virtualizing opportunity within an x86 environment, you can get three to four images per system. And if you look at and you move it up the product line on a p Series, you can get dozens, maybe up to hundreds. And if you get to z Series, you could do hundreds and we have customers that are doing in the low thousands, so a very powerful opportunity set for us, a very good position for us, and a very good play for our customer set that helps them reduce their costs, both IT and power consumption, which are important priorities in today’s economy.

Our next question comes from  Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets 
Thank you. I have a clarification and a question, please; on the clarification, Mark, I’m not sure if you said it through the transcript but I wanted to see if you could clarify what Cognos and Telelogic added for year-over-year growth rates on the top line, either as a percent of -- you know, either as a part of software or as IBM in total. 
And then on the question side, you normally provide some color about how you are thinking about the pipeline signings in the services arena, and just even against some metrics of last year or the recent quarter. I just wanted to get your perspective on the pipeline with any color on the competitive landscape there as well. Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge
Okay, fine. Let’s start off with your question about Cognos and Telelogic. I’m not going to go into just specifically those two acquisitions but if you look at the acquisitions as a whole that we have in the first half, and remember we’ve done 13 overall in the first half, of which nine were in software, but if you just look at the nine in software, and obviously that’s where the biggest ones are with Cognos and Telelogic, we’re -- on our revenue case, we’re slightly ahead of our profit case in those. Against a 17% growth that we had in the software group, about seven points was driven by acquisitions in total; for organic performance, about 10%. And as we look at that organic performance now on a constant currency basis, that should accelerate we think as we go into the third quarter. 
As far as our pipeline for services, we have a pretty good pipeline, I think, going into the third quarter and we are looking for growth continuing in our short-term signings. I think we’ve shown real momentum there. We see some acceleration and opportunity in our long-term signings, and a good pipeline of opportunity. 
There’s some characteristics I think though that you could look at in these signings. Let’s take long-term. I mean, in GTS, long-term was up 13% and if you look underneath that, business transformation is a very appealing opportunity, is up 45%. But if you look across the profile of both GTS and GBS, one of the very powerful opportunities in long-term is our growth markets. In our growth market, long-term signings were up a very powerful 72%. 
And that’s -- if you look at our long-term, that’s in face of the fact that in GBS last year, we had a signings performance that was up 70%, so a fairly difficult compare for us. If you look on the short-term signings base, again, very powerful performance at the top for IBM, up 8%, 6%, and 9% in the second quarter, [at actual rate is 18]. But it’s interesting again if you look at this and say well, how did that perform in the growth markets? Short-term signings for the last six quarters have grown 49% in first quarter ’07 in the growth markets, 19 in the second, 40 in the third, 37 in the fourth, 15 in the first, 25 in the second -- I mean, a very powerful performance against that. So I think we’ve had good performance there and we think we have good opportunity for growth as we go into the third quarter and the second half.

Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Mark, I wonder if you can share some anecdotes from conversations you’ve had with large enterprise customers that can help us better understand how your revenue growth can be so strong in the current macro environment? And maybe specifically, how you would characterize the potential for budget cuts in the back half of this year?
Mark Loughridge
Well, I think that’s a good question, and I think the best way for me to answer that is to give you examples of in our -- you know, our signings base where we had real value propositions that I don’t think everybody can replicate, that drove real performance for us. So in the text, in the prepared remarks that I gave, we talked about green data centers and converged communications. As you look at those two, and I’m just talking about just those two signings categories, in the second quarter combined we had over $370 million of signings against those two offerings, and we ended the second quarter with $1.1 billion of backlog going into the third quarter against just green data centers and converged communications. And if you look at those, those two examples, those are clearly targeted at solving our customer requirements in today’s environment. 
Now, green data centers, you could say well, maybe a lot of people could accomplish that. I don’t think so. If you look at our experience in data center management, we’ve designed and built more than 30 million square feet of raised floor data centers from Brussels to Bangalore. And imagine now we bring that expertise to this rapidly emerging growth set of markets that are building out infrastructure, it’s very powerful offering. And likewise, in converged communications services, we bring very powerful integrated capability to the table not just for our customers that are driving to save costs and conserve capital in the major markets, but also as we build out big infrastructure offerings in the growth markets. 
So I think it’s expertise, drives real value to our customer set, and has longevity as we move into the second half.

Our next question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank

Thanks. Mark, I wanted to understand the currency tailwind a little bit better. Obviously a significant tailwind on the top line. I was wondering if you could quantify the bottom line or the EPS impact that currency is providing, and relatedly to what extent is the P&L exposed to a stronger dollar, if that in fact does play out? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge
Sure, Chris. Let me start by saying it’s very difficult to analyze the effect of currency on the bottom line. We give statistics and differences on actual and constant currency on the revenue line, but as you migrate to the bottom line, it’s very difficult to quantify the effect, for a couple of reasons. 
First of all, we obviously run in an very competitive world and we believe that some of the cost base benefit in a weak dollar environment is in fact passed on to the customer. Now secondly, we hedge cash flows to mitigate the volatility of our global cash position, which also mitigates the volatility of currency on the P&L. 
Now that said, there’s no question that in a weak dollar environment, there is currency as a tailwind to both revenue and profit dollars, but I think one way to look at this is by assessing the impact on our margins. Now in businesses, like services, where costs and revenue are generally incurred in the same currency as we translate that back, margins are generally unaffected by currency. 
I think the bigger question is what is the effect on margins when costs to source in dollars and revenue in local currency in a weak dollar environment like our hardware business. So the question really is does the currency based cost benefit transfer to the bottom line and increase margin? And we believe that in general, some of the currency-based cost advantage is in fact passed on to the customer and reduce price rather than bottom line and increase margin. 
So we have many examples of this, both in our analysis of our price/mix cost analysis by platform, as well as the work that we do with our suppliers in the same way, and oftentimes we negotiate price reductions or in a period of currency based cost advantage. 
Now, I’d also qualify this that even if all -- let’s say all of the currency based cost advantage were transferred to the bottom line, currency would only improve IBM’s margin by a tenth or two, so this is not a big impact to margins. But as I said earlier, we believe that some of the currency based cost advantages in fact pass on to customers and reduce price in our competitive engagement, so in the end, we’re all fighting for that same business. So I personally think that there wasn’t much benefit in the second quarter margins from currency in a weak dollar environment, but again even if it all flowed to margin, currency would only account for a tenth or two of margin improvement. 
Now to your second point, I think the bigger question is how we manage through a period of rapidly strengthening dollar in the future. Well, first of all, our program to hedge cash flows does help mitigate the impact of reversal on the dollar, and it’s important to understand that a hedge does not eliminate the effect of currency; a hedge defers it. So if you look at the bulk of our hedges, they are one-year hedges. We do do multi-year hedges sometimes, but generally they are one year, and that gives you time to adjust your cost structures and sourcing strategy. 
So as we look at 2009, the hedges would help offset the currency impact if there were a reversal of the dollar, and we would adjust our cost and sourcing strategies to manage the impact in 2010. In addition, we always have natural hedges in the business mix, like the business we source in Rupees, as well as terms and conditions in some of our services contracts to protect against the steep reversal in currency. 
We’ve run a number of scenarios and feel confident in our ability to manage this and achieve our 2010 roadmap.

Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan
Thank you. Good afternoon. Mark, I want to see if you can give us a sense about the revenue growth contribution within software in terms of how much of growth are you seeing from your SMB initiatives as well as from the emerging markets? And are those two buckets growing at or above or below your corporate average for software? And how should we think about that going forward?
Mark Loughridge
Well, the software business I think had a very effective quarter on both the revenue and profit line. I think the important part on that, relative to the mix, is to remember that as software grew revenue 17%, they grew profitability by 19%, and that’s after absorbing the amortization of intangibles for our major acquisitions. 
But as far as our performance globally, we had pretty good growth on that base in both our major markets and our growth markets for a software business, and as I had said earlier, we expect organic constant currency performance in software to accelerate as we go into the third quarter. 
Operator
Our next question comes from David Grossman with Thomas Weisel.
David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners
Thank you. You know, Mark, if I understood your prepared remarks, I think you said that Global Finance was up ex the used equipment piece, and I was wondering, could you just help us understand the important of Global Finance, particularly given the global credit situation and how that flows through the P&L?
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Global Finance is a very strong part of our value offering to our customer set. Now, the Global Finance portfolio is a very straightforward vanilla technology financing business. There is nothing exotic in this play. 
The interesting thing about the Global Finance returns is we generate market returns in the financing cycle but we generate very good returns at end of lease against residual value. And that’s because number one, we have real capability in our global financing business to evaluate that residual value of the box and number two, we have the capability when we get that truck back of all the equipment to refurbish, revitalize and integrate it back into product line to substantiate the value of the residual value on that. 
And so frankly, as we look at return on equity, we get about half and half from the leasing profile and on the end of lease, which gives us a lot of I think sustainability in that base. 
Now, as far as a credit risk, we don’t see very much additional risk in our financing base. There’s nothing exotic, there’s no mortgage financing, there’s nothing outside of our sweet spot of capability there, and our -- generally our customer set is very high quality customers, two-thirds of it at investment grade and we’re very confident. 
So I frankly look at financing as a strong capability as we go into the second half and strong part of our offerings, and I don’t see outsized risk in the portfolio. 
Patricia Murphy
Before I turn it back to Mark for closing comments, I just -- we just learned that we did lose audio for a short while for those of you listening on the web and I apologize for that. We’ll have the comments on the web just as soon as we can get them up there, so let me turn it back to Mark for some closing comments. 

Mark Loughridge
Sure. Well, I want to thank you for joining us today. You know, as I close out the second quarter here, I was reflecting that we reintroduced the 2010 roadmap after we had completed our 2006 EPS of $6.06. Now, last year we did $7.18 and now I would say we’re on track to our current view of at least $8.75 for 2008. I think initially as we rolled out this roadmap, people were skeptical. But we have really executed on a very specific play to focus on capturing high growth in emerging markets and manage for productivity in major markets. 
Now this quarter, we had a powerful performance driven across the board by our technology leadership in hardware, software, and services. Hardware was very strong in our high value segment; z up 32%, p up 29%. Software grew revenue 17 and profit 19, and services grew revenue 16%, profit up 28 and signings up 12% with short-term up a pretty impressive 18%. 
So I think we are very well-positioned with what has turned out to be an adaptable business model, which gives clients what they need in both growth and established markets, so let’s look at that in a little more detail. We continued the momentum we saw in the emerging countries with revenue up 14% at constant currency in our growth markets organization and 20% constant currency in the BRIC countries. And as you look at the drivers of our growth in these emerging markets, it’s really backbone infrastructure with long-term sustainability. 
Now, we had better-than-expected performance in the major countries, with revenue up 5%. And if you track down that, you’ll see that the U.S. grew 5%, Canada 11, Germany 7, France 6, Italy 5, U.K. 4% -- pretty broad-based. And here we were very successful in not only delivering our new technology but as well, driving solutions to reduce costs, conserve capital, and deal with risk and compliance, all of which I think you would agree are very important in these markets. 
So we’re on track to achieve our revised forecast of at least $8.75 for 2008 and we are well on track to achieve our road map to $10 to $11 by 2010. 
So again, thank you for joining us today and now it’s back to business. ",https://seekingalpha.com/article/85591-ibm-q2-2008-earnings-call-transcript

Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) Now I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Madam, you may begin. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM. I am here with Mark Loughridge, IBM’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining our first quarter earnings presentation.

Now I will turn the call over to Mark Loughridge.
Mark Loughridge
Thanks for joining us today. We had a great start to the year with 11% revenue growth and 36% earnings per share growth. This is strong proof why we believe our business model is the right one for good times and for tough times. 
Now right up front I want to give you our perspective on what we are seeing in the marketplace. Consistent with what we’ve been saying for the last few months, we have good results because we can deliver specific value propositions to our customers. For example, offerings that save cost and conserve capital have moved up the prioritization list of our clients. 
And in this environment, clients want to be able to realize a faster payback on their investment, so projects that deliver short-term savings also did very well. Customer interest also remains strong for solutions that address specific client needs, such as risk management, and security, and energy efficiency. Growth also remains strong in the emerging markets, and we’re focused on building out the infrastructures in these countries. 
 
Now there were a few areas where we weren’t satisfied with our results. System X, a high-volume transaction business and our technology OEM business, where we had decreased demand. But these areas are lower margin businesses, so had little impact on our bottom line results. 
 
Unlike many other companies in our sector, we’re not dependent on high volume transactions each quarter to be successful. We have a strategy that is based on a more balanced and stable operating model. 
 
Our annuity businesses, which drive about half of our revenue, provide a solid base of profit and cash. We continued our focus on cost and expense management and expanded gross margin year to year for the 14th quarter of the last 15. We have a disciplined approach to aligning investments to growth, so while we are taking a more measured approach in the more stable markets, we are aggressively investing in high growth markets. 
 
We are also continuing to execute our acquisition strategy and successfully closed the acquisition of Cognos, our largest ever. But at the foundation of our business model we generate a lot of cash and we have a very solid balance sheet. The first quarter typically is the most difficult for cash generation, but strong operating results and good execution in receivables resulted in positive free cash flow in the first quarter for the first time in over five years. 
Even with aggressive levels of share repurchase and after spending almost $5 billion for the Cognos acquisition, we ended the quarter with $12 billion of cash on hand. 
Our operating model is in place and executing well, and we feel good about our start to 2008 so we’re taking our view of the year up by $0.25 and we now expect 2008 full year earnings per share of at least $8.50, which is 18% growth over 2007’s reported results. 
 
Now let’s turn to the financial summary. We delivered revenue of $24.5 billion, an increase of 11% as reported and 4% at constant currency. Our gross margin was up 1.2 points, with increases in services, systems and software. 
 
Expense was also up 11%. The expense growth was entirely driven by currency, acquisitions, and additional interest expense for last year’s accelerated share repurchase. Excluding these items, expense was slightly better year to year, as we maintained our focus on cost and expense management. This resulted in very strong pretax income growth of 24%. In the quarter, our pretax margin was 13% and net margin was 9.5%, both up over a point year to year. Our share count was down 8%. This reflects the benefit from last year’s aggressive share repurchases and a good start to 2008. 
 
Bottom line, we delivered $1.65 of EPS, up 36% year to year. So now let’s get into the details of the quarter, starting with a few different views of revenue. 
Revenue from our industry sales units was up 12%, or 5% at constant currency. All sectors were up this quarter, led by communications sector, which was up 16%. This was primarily driven by the telecom industry, as we help our clients transform their infrastructure and build out their data centers using green technologies. 
 
Our financial services revenue was up 14%. We returned to growth in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. where we generate three-fourths of the business, revenue was up 18%. Globally, we grew in all industries -- banking, financial markets, and insurance. This is now the second consecutive quarter that financial services performance was in line with our total sector performance. 
 
Now let’s look at our results by geography. Our Asia-Pacific revenue outside of Japan grew 18%, or 10% at constant currency, as the economies of these countries continue their rapid pace of growth. Japan’s revenue was up 11% but down at constant currency. 
Our growth in Europe was consistent with performance over the last few quarters, reflecting a moderate IT spend environment. 
The big improvement in the quarter was in the Americas, led by the U.S. U.S. growth accelerated from 2% in the fourth quarter to 6% in the first. We had good contribution from our annuity businesses, and also had particularly strong acceptance of the z10 mainframe, with double-digit growth. 
Turning to performance outside the United States, we spent a lot of time in the fourth quarter earnings call and at our investor meeting last month on the growth markets. Demand in these markets continues to be dominated by infrastructure build-out projects in telco, banking, and retail. We formed a new growth markets organization and management structure to make the most of this opportunity. This quarter, revenue from the countries in our growth markets unit was up 11% at constant currency and represented about 17% of IBM’s revenue. 
 
Let me give you a couple of examples of the kind of work we’re doing. We’re helping Telecom Egypt construct a state-of-the-art data center with sophisticated energy-efficient green technologies based on our z-platform. 
In Korea, we’re working with a leading bank to build an infrastructure to develop and sell capital markets products, as they expand into investment banking. 
And in Indonesia, we’re part of a collaborative effort to deliver a microfinance solution platform to broaden access to basic financial services across rural communities. 
 
These are all examples of the build-out of public and private infrastructures to support 3 billion people moving into the middle class in emerging markets. We certainly expect these trends to continue and we expect these rapidly growing markets to continue to fuel IBM’s revenue and profit engine in 2008 and into the future. 
 
Now let’s turn to revenue by segment. Once again our two services segments posted the strongest performance, continuing the momentum from the second half of last year. Our success was broad-based, with strong double-digit growth in all lines of business. Software growth was led by branded middleware, including the growth from the acquisition of Cognos and in Systems and Technology, we had a very successful launch of our new z10 mainframe, and good performance in storage and midrange System p. As I said, we are not satisfied with performance in a couple of areas, specifically System x and OEM Technology. 
 
In Global Financing, while the overall growth was impacted by a decline in the sale of used equipment, our financing revenue was up year to year, as we provide liquidity and competitive financing in a tightening credit environment. Our financing business is well-positioned to grow in this environment, now let me tell you why. 
First, the IBM balance sheet provides substantial financial flexibility and funding capacity and second, Global Financing assets and new financing volumes are mostly IBM products financed to IBM clients and channel partners, and substantially all assets are information technology assets which provide a stable base of business for future growth. This is straight-forward product financing. There is nothing exotic in this portfolio. The new System z and high-end p servers are a significant financing opportunity and a great example of the kind of business that we are developing. 
 
Global Financing has the unique ability to finance upgrades to IBM equipment at key points in the life cycle that gives them more capacity while holding to their expense budgets. More customers will see the benefit of this in today’s market conditions. Our clients and partners find Global Financing offerings very competitive given IBM’s borrowing cost and access to the capital markets. 
 
Now let’s turn to Expense. Total expense and other income increased 11%. With 11% revenue growth, our expense-to-revenue ratio improved modestly year to year. Now peeling back the 11% growth in expense, approximately six points of growth was due to currency. We estimate that four points of growth is from acquisitions, so starting with 11 minus 6 minus 4, we’re left with one point; the remaining point of growth is what we classify as operational. 
 
Now within this, we covered interest expense from our ASR and this impacted our expense growth by almost two points. So operational expense was actually slightly better year to year without the ASR interest. I think this is pretty impressive performance.  
With an $85 billion spend base, we have a lot of opportunity to take out cost and expense and drive productivity across our business. Let me give you an example. 
We’ve set aggressive targets to reduce spending for our infrastructure organizations. This includes support functions like HR, finance, and legal, and business enablement functions such as sales support, supply chain support, and administrative support. We’re using these savings to fund investments in growth markets and sales efforts, as well as contribute to our margin expansion, so it’s a pretty effective equation. 
 
Before we move on to margins, I’ll comment on the items that significantly impacted our profit growth this quarter. Retirement-related plans generated about $450 million of cost and expense in the quarter, a savings of about $190 million year to year. To put this in perspective, when you take all forms of compensation -- salary, bonus, equity awards, retirement-related plans -- our total compensation is up about $750 million year to year. 
 
Another item that I’d like to highlight is the impact from our hedging programs. We hedge the major cash flows to mitigate the effect of currency volatility in the year-over-year results. The impact of these hedging programs is reflected principally in other income and expense, and cost of goods sold. This quarter, the hedging losses in other income and expense were higher year to year by approximately $80 million. Now keep in mind that the losses mitigate the positive benefit of currency translation throughout our income statement. 
Now let me give you a snapshot of margins. We had broad-based margin expansion as we mix to higher value products and services. Margins were up in both services businesses, continuing to make progress on our 2010 roadmap. Global Technology Services was driven by strong profit growth in our strategic outsourcing and ITS. Our consulting business drove margin expansion in Global Business Services. Software margins improved, due primarily to good cost and expense management. And despite revenue declines, both gross and pre-tax margin improved in the Systems and Technology segment. 
 
So now let’s turn to the segments, starting with services. Our two Global Services segments delivered powerful results again this quarter, driven by the strength of our annuity base and a portfolio of offerings that drive cost savings and value for our clients. 
 
Total services revenue was $14.6 billion, up 17% as reported and 9% at constant currency. Both segments gained share, both grew revenue faster than their longer term growth objectives and combined, they delivered a 36% improvement in pretax income. 
 
This quarter, I want to give you an additional view of signings. As you know, we have always presented our signings at constant currency. But for our shorter term businesses in particular, signings at actual rates may give a better view of how these signings will convert to revenue. And others in the industry report signings at actual rates. So to provide a more comprehensive view of our business and better comparability to market data, we are providing you with signings at both actual and constant currency rates. 
 
Signings this quarter were $12.6 billion at actual rates, up 6%, while at constant currency, signings were $10.8 billion, down 2% year to year. Our short-term signings were up 13% at actual rates and up 6% at constant currency, while long-term signings were flat at actual rates and down 10% at constant currency. We signed 11 deals larger than $100 million, and our backlog was an estimated $118 billion, up over $2 billion year to year. 
 
Let me talk a minute about the demand environment. The services market has shifted to one which favors solutions that deliver shorter time to value. Clients are focused on a faster payback driven by proven value propositions and there is no shortage of opportunities for deals that fit those characteristics. 
 
Looking at our short-term businesses, we had good short-term signings in our key plays in ITS, the plays that focus on infrastructure savings and efficiencies. Within GBS, cost take-out is the primary motivator. In the shorter term businesses, by focusing our efforts on areas where we see good demand we’ve been able to generate a good pipeline of deals. 
 
Now when you look at our longer term offerings, the value propositions are very similar, just more complex, and they take longer to drive from business development to deal closure. Overall, we have a strong set of long-term offerings. They play well in the current environment and although that environment is tough, the demand is there when we provide value, faster payback and savings. So now let’s turn to the segment details. 
 
For Global Technology Services, revenue was up 17% and 9% at constant currency. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth at or above our long-term objective. We had double-digit growth in all lines of business. 
Our signings were up 2% at actual rates and down 7% at constant currency. Short-term signings were up 11% at actual rates and 4% at constant currency, while long-term signings were down 2% at actual rates and 12% at constant currency.
 
Our Strategic Outsourcing revenue was up 16%. This is the largest annuity component of the services business. Growth is being driven by our strong backlog, last year’s signings, and continued growth in our base accounts. Despite economic concerns, we continue to sell into our existing accounts, where we can provide cost savings and a faster return on investment for our clients. 
 
Business Transformation Outsourcing was up 34% as reported. We had double-digit revenue growth in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. 
 
Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 15%. We continue to see good momentum in our ITS key infrastructure plays. These offerings contributed $500 million in signings, or about a quarter of total ITS signings. Our Green Data Center was nearly $200 million of that, continuing the trend that we had described in the fourth quarter. 
 
Our maintenance revenue was up 19%. This includes the services provided to Ricoh Info Print, which contributed about seven points of growth at constant currency in the quarter. The work will transition to Ricoh in the second quarter. 
 
Our Global Technology Services pretax profit was up 45% and margin was 9.8%, up two points year to year. This margin expansion was driven by improved productivity and improved cost structure in our Strategic Outsourcing organization, a mix to higher value products in ITS, and year-to-year savings in retirement-related costs. 
 
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was up 17% as reported and 9% at constant currency. Signings were up 12% at actual rates and up 6% at constant currency. Short-term signings were up 14% at actual rates and 7% at constant currency. 
 
Within GBS, clients are motivated by projects with shorter-term paybacks. Signings were driven by clients globalizing and integrating their businesses, creating shared services and centers of excellence, innovating in new markets, and replacing costly legacy systems. So while the engagements may be transformational in nature, the ultimate motivation and benefit is to realize hard economic returns. 
In the Americas over 90% of the transactions came from projects with shorter paybacks which yield cost savings. For the rest of the geographies, about two-thirds came from cost savings initiatives. Long-term signings were up 7% at actual rates and down 1% at constant currency. 
We grew revenue double-digits in all geographies and all sectors. 
 
We continued to see good results in Application Management Services and core consulting. We had strength across all consulting service lines, which include; financial management services, human capital management, CRM, supply chain, and strategy and change. 
 
Global Business Services pretax profit was up 23% and margin was 11.2%, up seven-tenths of a point year to year. This improvement was driven by good contract management, increased utilization, and year-to-year pension improvement. 
 
To wrap up services, we think we have the right set of offerings and the execution plan to take advantage of the opportunities in the market. 
Now turning to Systems and Technology, revenue of $4.2 billion was down 7% year to year or 12% at constant currency. Without the divested printer business, revenue was down 2% or 7% at constant currency, but pretax income was up over 50% year to year and margin was up 1.3 points. 
 
Our strongest revenue performance was in mainframe, midrange System p and Storage, as customers continue to respond to virtualization value propositions. This quarter we had a successful launch of our new z10 mainframe and continued strength in our POWER6 offerings. 
 
Offsetting this strength was weakness in our System x business and continued softness in OEM Technology. However, as I said earlier, these are low margin businesses so they had little impact on our profit. 
 
Now, let me take you through the brands. System z revenue was up 10% year to year. MIPS grew 14%, gaining market share. Revenue growth was fueled by the successful introduction of new z10 enterprise class server. With up to 70% more total capacity and a 100% performance improvement on CPU-intensive workloads, the z10 enables large scale consolidations and unmatched utilization. This allows our clients to reduce technology and energy costs while simplifying their data centers. 
 
Our System i revenue declined 21% in the quarter. This month we introduced a unified POWER platform which utilizes the same hardware for both i and p. The new products will be reported in the converged System p category. This gives legacy System i customers full access to the entire line of POWER-based systems, including new blades offerings so it’s a very good announcement for our i customer base. 
 
System p grew revenue 2% in the first quarter and gained share. We had very strong performance in the POWER6 based midrange offerings, with revenue up over 50%. This was offset by softness in the high-end as customers await our new POWER6 products. These high end products were just announced on April 8th. 
Our technology innovation on POWER6 is pretty impressive. At five gigahertz, it is the fastest microprocessor in the world -- no one else is even close. The technology innovation and virtualization capability of the product provides our customers with improved energy and space efficiency and enables substantial consolidation of under-utilized servers. 
 
System x server revenue was flat year to year. While the high-end grew 13%, we had weakness in the low-end as you would expect in this environment, as well as some sales execution issues we need to work through. Our momentum in blades continued with revenue up 31% year to year. 
 
In Storage, with revenue up 10% year to year, we gained share. Total disk was up 6%. We had double-digit growth in enterprise disk on continued strength of the DS8000, which was up 17% and this quarter, we started to integrate recently acquired XIV into our storage portfolio. 
We again had a strong performance in tape, which was up 18%. This reflects the value in total cost of ownership, power consumption, and data protection offered by IBM's tape solutions. 
 
Retail Store Solutions revenue was down 3% year to year, though we had strong gross margin performance. Technology revenue was down 20% year to year. This is the performance of our microelectronics OEM business, which has little impact to IBM’s profit. The primary mission of our technology business is to provide leadership technology for our systems business, as we saw this quarter in our new z10 mainframe and POWER6 systems announcements. 
 
For total Systems and Technology, gross profit margin was up over two points year to year, and up in four of our six systems brands. This drove our pre-tax income growth of 50%. 
 
Our software revenue of $4.8 billion grew 14% year to year, or 6% at constant currency. Pretax income was up 22% and PTI margin was up 1.6 points. 
 
Our branded middleware products grew 19% year to year. Branded middleware comprises 53% of our total software segment revenue, up six points from first quarter of 2006. 
 
In a few of the more established markets, there was more scrutiny of deals at the end of the quarter with additional approvals required. However, the growth markets continued to perform well. Some of our largest deals were in China, Latin America and Eastern Europe. In this environment, we are seeing customer demand focused in three key areas. 
 
First, customers purchased products that can improve their business operations and drive cost savings. Now let me give you a couple of examples. WebSphere Integration Software allows customers to integrate disparate systems for better business efficiency. This is part of our WebSphere brand, which grew 20% and gained share in the first quarter. 
 
Another example is Cognos’ performance management solution, which helps customers improve decision-making across the enterprise to optimize business performance. The recent Cognos acquisition is part of our Information Management brand, which grew 27% in the quarter and also gained share. 
 
Second, customers purchase products to address the complex regulatory environment of today’s business, such as Tivoli Security and Storage Management products. These provide secure access to key data and applications and provide consistent data retention across the enterprise. Total Tivoli software grew 9% in the quarter and our Storage Management software has generated 14 straight quarters of double-digit growth. 
 
Third, customers continue to invest in their strategic priorities, using software such as Lotus Collaboration and social networking software to increase productivity across their local and global teams. Lotus software grew 17%, our 14th consecutive quarter of growth and we believe we gained share in the quarter. 
 
Overall, software pretax income grew 22% year to year and the pretax margin grew 1.6 points. This is even after absorbing the amortization of intangibles associated with our recent acquisitions. 
 
Now let’s turn to cash and the balance sheet. Free cash flow for the quarter was $600 million, up $800 million over last year. Adjusting for the $500 million contribution to our U.S. retiree medical trust last year, free cash flow was up $300 million. This performance was driven by our strong net income and good working capital management, especially accounts receivable, where days sales outstanding improved seven-tenths days year to year. 
 
We had significant cash applications this quarter. We completed the purchase of Cognos for $4.8 billion, our largest acquisition ever. We also completed six smaller acquisitions, including Arsenal Digital Solutions, Net Integration Technologies, and Solid Information Technologies. 
 
We funded capital investments of $1.2 billion. We reduced non-global financing debt by $1.7 billion and we returned $3 billion to shareholders with share repurchase of $2.4 billion and dividends of almost $600 million. 
In February, our board approved further returns to shareholders with a share repurchase authorization of $15 billion. We expect to spend up to $12 billion on share repurchase in 2008 and we had $13.5 billion of repurchase authority remaining at the end of the first quarter. 
So now let’s turn to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with very strong financial flexibility. Our cash on hand was $12 billion. The cash balance declined $4.1 billion from year-end, due primarily to the investment in Cognos. Our cash is conservatively invested to protect the principal amount and to maintain liquidity. We do not expect any negative impact due to the market conditions. 
 
Our non-financing debt decreased in the first quarter and now stands at $8.9 billion. Our debt to total capital is 26%, down from 30% at year-end 2007 and within our long-term objective of 20% to 30%. 
Investors can expect our debt levels and leverage to vary as the company manages its global cash and debt position. However, over the long-term we intend to manage the business back within the target range of 20% to 30%. 
 
Global Financing debt is $26.2 billion. This business, as you know, is leveraged at 6.9 to 1 and our equity is strong at $28.7 billion. So you put all of this together and the IBM balance sheet remains strong and in position to support the business as needed. 
 
Now let’s start to wrap up the discussion by showing you the drivers of our 36% earnings-per-share growth. We had revenue growth of 11%, including seven points of currency benefit. At constant mix and margin, this contributed $0.14 of the $0.44 of year-to-year EPS growth. 
 
We again expanded our gross margin, led by our two services segments, and systems and technology. This contributed another $0.14. Of that, about a $0.05 was due to the year-to-year benefit from our retirement-related plans that flowed to cost. The balance of the pension savings went to expense, for another $0.04 benefit. At the same time, our operational expense management yielded $0.03 cents and while we had additional interest expense related to last year’s ASR, an impact of a about a nickel, we generated a significant benefit of $0.13 from our aggressive share repurchases over the last year. Finally, a 100 basis point reduction in our tax rate yielded another $0.02. 
 
So as always, our performance is not dependent on one factor but rather solid contribution from revenue growth, margin expansion, and share repurchase. 
 
This is a strong start to 2008, with our operational model really coming through. We had some headwinds this quarter. As you’d expect in this environment, customers are scrutinizing deals more closely. We also had tailwinds, including currency, but most important of all, we had very strong operating performance. 
So let’s recap the highlights -- our services segments had strong revenue performance, each up 17%. GTS profit was up 45%, and GBS profit up 23%. While hardware revenue was down, we had a successful launch of the z10 mainframe, and continued success in POWER6 and storage offerings. Software completed the acquisition of Cognos and grew revenue 14% and grew profit 22%. 
From a geo perspective, our growth markets organization grew 11% at constant currency and the U.S. improved to 6% revenue growth with impressive profit growth, demonstrating the value of IBM’s offerings in the current environment. Profit growth was broad-based from a geo perspective as well, with strong profit growth in each of our geographies. 
We have a strong balance sheet, financial flexibility, and proven ability to generate cash, and ended the quarter with an impressive $12 billion of cash. Obviously we’ve just concluded a very strong quarter. 
 
Now, it’s early in the year and we wouldn’t typically change full-year expectations after the first quarter, but we got off to a really great start and we now expect 2008 earnings per share of at least $8.50, which is 18% growth over 2007 reported earnings.
We believe success is measured over the long-term, however, and we remain focused on our objective to deliver our 2010 roadmap. With this strong performance, we are on track to our 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 of earnings per share. 
 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark’s prepared remarks. Second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I’ll turn the call back to Mark for some final remarks.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein
Thank you. Mark, I wanted to ask a question about your outlook and feeling for the services business. Short-term signings at constant currency were up 13%, long-term signings over the last few quarters have been relatively flat but you guys have commented that the yield is a lot shorter. So putting these factors together, can you comment about how you feel about services over the next couple of quarters relative to how you felt at the end of the year? It’s the business where you have the greatest visibility given its backlog nature, so can you comment how you are feeling in absolute terms about the services business looking forward and relative to how you felt at the end of the year?
Mark Loughridge
Yeah, I’d be happy to go through that. Let’s start with the fourth quarter, really. I mean, we looked at the fourth quarter, we had good short-term signings up 8%. Within that, the U.S. was up 16%. Now you take that short-term into the first quarter, you know, once again good short-term signings, globally up 6%, U.S. up 15. I think we’ve got a good mix of business on that element of the equation going forward. 
When you look at long-term, long-term is just not uniformly distributed through quarters. That is, we look at the kind of -- the balance of the opportunity that we see for the year, we’ve got good opportunities here. So if I take all of the elements and put those together and look forward for the year, in the second quarter I’d soon think that both of the service units should be well into double-digits. 
Now remember, we are facing a second quarter last year where we had stronger performance in our business lines, so we do as a corporation have a more difficult compare last year. But on an actual rate basis, I see strong double-digits, both of our services organizations and I think we’ve got a good run-rate on margin and margin improvement that you could see the momentum moving through the second quarter last -- the second half of last year into the first quarter this year and I think we’ve got good margin plans going into the second quarter as well. 
As far as the broader view, certainly with the opportunities that we see through the year and the momentum that we see on the kind of cadence on short-term performance, we should be well within our model range for our services business in the back half of the year as well. 
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein
Thank you, Mark. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Mr. David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on linearity in the quarter, particularly given the comments from several companies inside and outside of tech. You commented a little bit on the software side but what did you see in the last two weeks of the quarter?
Mark Loughridge
Of the skew of the business through the quarter -- we did see stronger growth rates in the first two months compared to the third month, but if you look at it we’ve been seeing that phenomena through the last six to eight quarters. I mean, we’ve been doing a lot of work, David, to try and move that skew of business into the earlier months so we are not so dependent on that back-end skew of the business. 
So if you asked the question did we see stronger growth in the first two months, the answer to that is yes. But if you said well is that different than the characteristics that you’ve seen in prior quarters, the answer is now. This quarter and that skew of business within the quarter was very characteristics of prior quarters. In fact, if you look at the third month growth rate and compared it to the fourth quarter, very similar. 
So I look at it and I don’t think it is an indication of the change in the opportunity or the market for us. It’s more a reflection of the change in our skew of business as we manage the business that way. 
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs
So you don’t think there was any -- 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Let’s go to the next question. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
Thanks. Mark, you -- in response to Toni’s question you talked a fair amount about what’s going on on the short-term side with services bookings but during your prepared remarks, you did comment that it’s a tougher environment for long-term signings. Could you talk about the pipeline on the long-term side as you see it currently going into the second quarter and what you think the opportunity for growth there is for the balance of the year?
Mark Loughridge
You know, I think my comment, just to be perfectly clear, my comment on long-term, Richard, is that it is not uniformly distributed across quarters. So as we look at that pipeline and opportunity set for long-term on kind of a two, three, four-quarter basis, we think we have a lot of opportunity. 
As far as growth, I mean, based on the contracts that we see in the second quarter, we think that we are going to have that ongoing growth rate in short-term signings. We think that we are going to have growth in the second quarter on long-term signings and consequently obviously growth in total signings in the second quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Richard. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Good afternoon. Mark, with the macro and credit conditions deteriorating, did you have to change any of your financing or receivable reserve ratios in the March quarter? 
Mark Loughridge
No. No, we saw very little effect, frankly, of the tightening credit environment on our business equation. You know, one way that you can see that, just look at DSO. I mean, DSO was frankly even better. If you look at the kind of a cross-section of our portfolio in the financing business, two-thirds of that is very strong investment grade client base, so it’s a very solid client base. We did not see an impact on the credit environment. 
It is a very straightforward vanilla, if you will, financing business for equipment financing in the technology realm, which we understand very, very well. So I am frankly quite optimistic about the opportunities for the financing business going forward because frankly what we see is that we have a financing business with a solid book of business, a very credit worthy customer base, and a back stop by the IBM Corporation and I think it’s going to have a competitive advantage versus other financing businesses as we go through the year. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy. Let’s go to the next question. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns.
Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns
I just wanted to go back to the macroeconomic question and as you are dealing with -- you talked over the past couple of quarters about some areas of strength and some areas of weakness. Could you give us a sense about where the strength is coming from? You talked about telecom in particular but again, given that some of your results are contrary to what we are seeing in other sectors and from other -- from overall macroeconomic area, could you talk about and give us a little more color on areas where you are seeing strength and areas where you are seeing weakness?
Mark Loughridge
You bet. I think this quarter has played out quite consistent with the way we’ve seen the business and again, I would say this isn’t that inconsistent with what you hear from others. I think that we are playing this from a different point on the field. So let me explain what I mean by that. 
We have said in January as we look forward that we intended to invest heavily to capture the growth that we saw in the emerging growth markets and when you look at the fourth quarter and you look at the first quarter, sure enough very, very solid growth there. And if you look at the driver behind the growth in those markets, this is infrastructure. This isn’t just rolling out commoditized content. This is very strong infrastructure plays in the emerging growth markets. So I think that’s played out quite consistently. 
Number two, we looked at it and as we said, we are moving forward. We are going to play the established countries on a conservative basis, looking for productivity. And I said that I wasn’t going to build a model that required a resurgence in those established markets as we went into ’08 and I think that turns out to have been the right play to have called. And by and large, those established markets kind of performed in that envelope. The one exception obviously in this quarter was in fact the United States, and the United States did have a much stronger growth rate than was typical of this kind of a game plan. 
So what drove the United States? Well, a couple of things. Number one, we knew we had a relatively strong hand coming into the quarter because short-term signings in the fourth quarter for the U.S. being up 16%, and as we looked at the composition of those savings and we looked at what customers were spending on, it was very logical. We were able to kind of flexibly design programs that drove cost savings for our client base and can serve cash for our client base and those did very, very well. 
In some respects, you could categorize those short-term signings in the first quarter and the bulk of those were in fact solving those kinds of problems for our client base. So I’d say that was the first big driver. 
The second big driver is we rolled out the new z10 -- I mean, remember, the z10 had 34 days of shipments in the quarter and in the U.S., the z10 grew 14% year to year, so it was a very strong technology rollout for that platform. The POWER6 architecture on the midrange of the p series was up 56%, another good strong performance from our technology platform.  
So I think those kind of drove the composition. If you look at it from an industry trend, you know, globally, telecom did very, very well -- very, very well and it’s kind of our leading industry. No wonder, no wonder when you look at that telecom build-out in these emerging countries. 
An example that I gave at the analyst day, you know, if you take the big three telecom providers in India, they are signing 55,000 cell phone contracts a day and we have the major contracts between -- behind all three of those, so telecom was very, very powerful. 
Financial services sector frankly grew with the industry, with the industry average for IBM. So I think financial services did well. 
We had pretty strong performance from public, pretty strong performance from industrial. So -- but I think this is for the most part has played out as we expected. I think we called the right play for this kind of environment, investing to capitalize on those growth markets, a prudent plan in the established to drive for productivity. 
The surprise, I guess, this quarter was the resurgence we saw in the U.S. but again, pretty logically around cost, cash conservation, and the new technology announcements in the quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Andy. Let’s go to the next question. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.
Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan
Thank you. Good afternoon. Mark, if you could talk a little more about the emerging growth markets. Obviously it’s been a focal point and a good highlight, but how much of that is -- how much of that region is a percent of recurring revenues for your overall business and what is the incremental leverage opportunity there as you continue to scale that return in revenues from emerging markets?
Mark Loughridge
Well, if you look at the emerging markets and the composition for the emerging markets, Mark, one way to look at it -- take China as an example. Generally, China and the business in China has a higher composition of hardware and hardware rollout in the base of the business. And if you look at that, that’s very logical. That is very logical because we are now moving into this rapidly emerging growth markets. They are filling out that hardware base, that basic structure as they fill out infrastructure and then on that infrastructure will then move in and drive maintenance, will drive software growth, drive financing, all of those other elements of the business equation. 
So I think you’ve got to look at it as kind of a rollout in an emerging growth market. Hardware moves in first, then we move in with software, financing, strong maintenance offerings, and those in turn establish an annuity base going forward. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Let’s go to the next question. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Cowen & Company.
Louis Miscioscia - Cowen & Company
Thank you. You gave a good description of your different industries and if I could look at your -- when I look at your small-medium business though, it only grew 3% in constant currency. Would you say that’s more indicative I guess of maybe that are seeing weakness, or is that an area that -- I know you’ve been reorganizing, that you need to focus on a little bit more?
Mark Loughridge
That’s a very interesting question, when you look at small-medium business. And it really pretty neatly fits back to the framework we established coming into the year, the split of growth emerging as compared to established. 
Really SMB, small-medium business, had a very, very strong performance in these emerging markets -- very strong performance. The area where it was weaker was frankly in the established, and it was in the established in an element, a marketplace that was probably more susceptible to this tougher credit environment and tougher economic conditions. 
But if you looked at it globally, it had a very strong quarter in these emerging growth markets. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Lou. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Fidacaro with Merrill Lynch.
Jeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch
Good afternoon. I was wondering -- if you take a look across the business, did you observe any elongation of sales cycles or any material deferrals that were in the quarter that may fall in the June quarter? I know you mentioned some scrutiny of deals on the software side. 
Mark Loughridge
Well, you know, we did see -- as I think is again very logical, anticipated -- you did see customers being, scrutinizing deals more carefully. Who wouldn’t, right? Who wouldn’t? I think that’s a logical thing. We saw that predominantly in the established markets. So I think some of those deals did roll over and if you kind of looked at it by element of our business, I mean, we have had a good couple of weeks in April against our software objective, so we felt good about that. If you look at on our services side of the business, you know, we’ve already saw three deals larger than $100 million for $400 million, so we did see some portion of that rolling over and I feel confident we’ll capture that. 
The elongation of the sales cycle I think was predominantly in established markets and -- but I don’t think it’s going to be an ongoing impact as we see second quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Jeff. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.
Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets 
Thanks very much for taking the call. I had two quickies I want to try to fit in, if I could. First on the hardware side, Mark, I understand the z was only out for 30-plus days. If I look at some of the other categories, they seem to be much weaker than the balance of your business, even netting out the technology side, including the constant currency impact. How do you see that unfolding here as the hardware is more of the transactional side of the business and seems to be more subject to the economic cycle that we may be in? How should we think about the balance of the business excluding the z?
And the second one is if you could just tell us how much did Cognos add during the quarter, that would be helpful. Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge
On the hardware side, I’d like to go down that by product line. So if you look at System z, up 10%, I think that was pretty good performance and remember, now we go into the second quarter. We’ve going to have three months of these sales. We had always said that z was going to be -- the first quarter for z was going to be a quarter of transition and be a growth driver as we go into the second quarter and the second half, and I think it’s going to play out that way. But I thought z did quite well. 
When you look at storage, I think storage did pretty well. You know, it was up 10%. And if you look underneath that, the high end of storage, the DS8000, was up 17%, tape was up 18%, so I think we had some pretty good storage performance. 
Underneath System p, this was very characteristic of the rollout of the new technologies. The midrange p was up 59%. That’s the midrange. It now has the new architecture, the POWER6 architecture on it. We did see a stall on the high-end, again pretty logically because customers are waiting for the rollout of that new architecture on the high-end as well. 
So if I look at p series, z series, and storage, I think we had pretty good performance on the hardware base. Now you are quite correct -- when you look at the other elements of the equation specific to technology, I think we could have done a better job in technology but technology, this is OEM technology. This is not the base technology going into the platform. And I know I’ve said this a couple of times but technology, you know, at most we’re running 1% of IBM's profit and these perturbations around that don’t impact our profitability much. 
Also, you know, we could have done I think a little better on x series. x I think is more like SMB, more susceptible to this credit environment that we saw. But on the other hand, blades were up 31%. So I count blades as pretty good performance. 
So on balance, I think again this kind of conformed to the way we are rolling out our business plan and I think we did -- I think we did okay in the higher margin, higher technology element to our business that drive more value adds to our customer set. 
As far as Cognos, Cognos added about one point to our overall growth rate for IBM and then within the U.S., within the 6% there’s about one point of that 6%. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Keith. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaw Wu with American Technology Research.
 
Shaw Wu - American Technology Research
Thanks. Just a little more color in terms of your POWER6 transition. You talked about it a little bit but just in terms of where you are in terms of the transition. And any comment on the -- I guess the consolidation of your i series and p series, kind of the rationale behind that and do you see any impact on your business? Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge
Sure. The POWER6 technology will now be available across the product portfolio in the second quarter, as it’s rolled out in the high-end. And again, if you look at it, I am pretty optimistic about that potential, given what we saw in the POWER6 rollout in the midrange. 
We do have this convergence against the i series and now it really opens the aperture for our i series customers because they have the availability of moving to this new consolidated platform and the breadth and the performance of a p series organization. It gives you leverage, it gives you efficiency, and it also gives a good growth plan for those i series customers. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Shaw. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our last question in queue comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks very much. You raised annual guidance by about $0.25. Can you split the difference of that increase in expectations between performance of the base business and the weak dollar, where the currency [tail in]? Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge
Sure. This is performance of the base business. I mean, if you are looking for the confirmation of that, that is performance of the base business, so we just had -- you know, as you look at it, a very powerful quarter here and I think we have some very optimistic signs as we go into the next quarter. So this is a confirmation I think of the business equation. 
I am certainly not going to leave our view of the remaining part of the year susceptible to vacillations on currency. I am going to base it on what I see operationally and our performance operationally going forward. 
Now let me just take a minute -- I think it’s logical, especially coming from that question, to talk about a little bit how we put our view of the year together and how it reflects the way we are managing the business. 
We’ve said this a couple of times but I think it is playing out as expected. We are managing this business for growth in the emerging growth countries and we are moving expense into those countries to capitalize on those opportunities. I know at one point in the fourth quarter we called this the gold rush and I still believe this is a huge opportunity for us as we move forward. 
In the established countries, we are investing in driving for productivity and productivity because we are not going to leave the guidance we give susceptible to large oscillations in that performance. If those established countries did better than we expected, well sure there could be some upside here. But that’s not how we’ve built this forward-looking view of the business. 
We did see, as I said, some very encouraging signs. z series up 10% at actual, 14% in the U.S. This midrange p, again that new technology element of p series, up 59%. We are going into the second quarter. We are now going to have a full quarter of z. Our just announced high-end p is going to roll through. 
I think we had good momentum on the high end of our storage business with the DS8000 up 17%, tape up 18%. And I think really solid short-term signings in services up 13% at actual and 6% at constant currency for that very, very steady performance across that metric. 
If you look at -- I think software was a solid quarter, middleware was up 19% and if you looked at the reflection of software and you again tailor that to this way that we are running the base plan, software outside of the G7 was up 21% at actual and 10% at constant currency, and virtually all of that growth was organic. So I think pretty powerful performance as we roll that through. 
We’ve got an additional point of margins. This was a function of all the work that we have done over years, over years to drive from commodity type business to value businesses. And I think that was a big driver of our profitability up 24%. And with that strong margin and contribution from our services organization, add the share repurchase that we’ve driven and EPS up 36%, so I think we have optimism going into this second quarter.
Again, could there be upside? Well, it depends on the established markets. If they don’t move forward, we’re still very consistent with this outlook that they did see some ongoing acceleration. There could be upside. 
So we are pleased that we could roll in this additional $0.25. If you look at it, over the last hundred days, we’ve now increased that outlook for the year by $0.60 and I think it’s significant to remember that’s based on real [achievement], not just pointing to the -- so thank you very much for joining our call today and now off to get to work on the second quarter.

Now I will turn the call over to Mark Loughridge.
Mark Loughridge
Thanks for joining us today. Earlier this week we announced record revenue and earnings per share and today we’ll go through the details of our fourth quarter performance. This turned out to be a great quarter, in fact the strongest revenue and profit performance in almost a decade. And as you will see, a great close to ’07 but an even better start to ’08. 
 
The performance reflects the strength of our global model. In the fourth we generated 65% of our business outside of the U.S. By capitalizing on the opportunities in the global economies we delivered 10% revenue growth. Our performance was especially strong in Asian regions excluding Japan. 
The IBM business model drove 24% earnings per share growth in this quarter. Obviously we had excellent operating leverage, a by-product of all the work we’ve been doing to drive our 2010 roadmap. 
 
Looking at our results by segment, Services continued the momentum we’ve seen over the year. Global Technology Services revenue was up 16%, profit up 26%. Global Business Services revenue was up 17%, profit up 9%. And we signed $15.4 billion of new business, and importantly short term signings were up 8%.
 
In Software, strong execution resulted in good transaction closing rates and revenue growth of 12%. In Hardware, taking into account the product transition in System z, we had good performance in Systems with strong performance in System p and Storage. In the fourth quarter, Systems and Technology revenue growth was flat excluding the divested printer business but the real story here is the margin improvement, driving 18% growth in profit.
 
Looking at our cash and balance sheet performance, we had record cash performance, generating $12.4 billion of free cash flow, up $1.9 billion over 2006 levels. This contributed to a cash balance at the end of the year of $16.1 billion. 
 
We are in great shape as we enter 2008, and expect earnings per share growth of 
15% to 16% off our 2007 base of $7.13 without the printer gain from the second quarter. This would result in an EPS range of $8.20 to $8.30. And with this strong performance, we are on track for our 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 of earnings per share. 
 
Now let’s turn to the financial summary for the quarter. 
 
We delivered revenue of $28.9 billion, an increase of 10% as reported and 
4% at constant currency. 
Gross margin was up four-tenths of a point, driven by improvements in our Systems business. 
 
Expense was up 9%. We maintained our focus on cost and expense management, while continuing to invest for growth in key markets. 
 
With this operating leverage, both pretax income and net income are up a very strong 14%, and up 17% excluding the additional interest expense for our accelerated share repurchase. We delivered a pretax margin of 19% and net margin of 13.7%, a very high level of return. 
 
Share count was down 8%. This reflects almost $19 billion of share repurchase, with the majority coming from our accelerated share repurchase in May. 
 
Bottom line, we delivered $2.80 of EPS, a growth of 24% year to year. Now let me give you a quick summary of the full year 
For 2007 we delivered $98.8 billion of revenue, pretax earnings of $14.5 billion, and earnings per share of $7.18, all record levels. 
Many of you look at our business without the gain from the sale of our printer business in the second quarter. Without this gain, earnings per share was $7.13, that’s 18% growth. 
We expanded margin, generated $12.4 billion of free cash flow, and returned $21 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We had a great fourth quarter and 2007. 
 
Before moving on, let me add a different perspective to our profit performance. 
 
As you know, there are a few items in our operating results that many other companies, especially in the tech sector, exclude from the discussion of their earnings. I’d like to give you a sense of the magnitude of some of these items. 
Within our $14.5 billion of pretax income, we absorbed about $370 million for the amortization of purchased intangibles. We absorbed over $700 million of stock-based compensation. We absorbed about $350 million of charges for ongoing restructuring, primarily reflecting resource rebalancing activity, and we absorbed $2.6 billion of cost and expense for retirement related plans. Together, these four items impacted our pretax income by $4 billion.
These items are part of our ongoing business and we view them in the same way as any other element of cost or expense that impacts our financial statement, so let me get into the fourth quarter details, starting with revenue by sector.
We had growth in all sectors with particular strength in Communications but let me spend a minute on Financial Services sector. This quarter, growth in Financial Services was 11%, or 5% at constant currency. This is consistent with IBM’s total sector performance and also more in line with FSS growth in the first half of the year. 
Similar to last quarter, by brand, the largest impact was in System z worldwide as customers look forward to the new product. So this impact was more a function of the product transition than the sector. 
 
By geography the U.S., which represents about 25% of the total, was flat. But 75% of the Financial Services business is outside the U.S., and was up 15%, or 6% at constant currency. So our very good performance outside of the U.S. drove solid results in the sector. 
 
Now let’s look at our overall performance by geography. Americas revenue growth was 2% at constant currency. U.S. growth was also 2%, which we believe is in line with the market.
 
Europe had more steady performance, up 16% as reported and 6% at constant currency. This quarter most major countries were up at constant currency, led by Spain, which was up a very powerful 15%. The European market environment continues at moderate IT spend and our steady performance throughout 2007 reflects that environment. We have seen mid-single-digit revenue growth each quarter in Europe. 
 
Asia-Pacific again had the best performance at constant currency, up 15% as reported and 9% at constant currency. Revenue in Japan, now less than half of Asia-Pacific, grew modestly as reported but declined at constant currency. So the AP results were clearly driven by performance in other regions where the economies remain strong. 
Each of these regions, India, China, Australia/New Zealand, ASEAN, and Korea grew between 15% and 25% at constant currency and together they grew 20% at constant currency. More importantly, we estimate that the profit contribution from these regions was up more than 40%. 
 
Now, while we often discuss the BRIC countries, there are many other nations with a similar growth profile. Countries like Malaysia, Poland, South Africa, Ecuador and dozens more around the world with insatiable demands created by a growing middle class for public and private infrastructures to support explosive economic growth. To me, this is a virtual gold rush in these rapidly emerging economies. 
So let me explain what I mean. In some ways the build-out of infrastructure is much like the construction of the railroads and telegraph lines that helped open new markets during the California Gold Rush. In the past, IBM helped build the business and IT infrastructure for much of the developed world. 
Today, in what has become the “Gold Rush of the 21st century,” we see a new era of growth for IBM in these emerging markets. We are being selected by governments, institutions and businesses to design, build and run the infrastructures that support their operations. 
 
As you can see from the highlights on this map, there is a new reality about emerging countries and IBM’s business there. First, they are a lot more than just the BRIC countries; Singapore, Peru, the Czech Republic, I mean, you get the idea but it’s much broader than just Brazil, Russia, India and China. 
And they’re big. The countries shown here represent 22% of IBM’s revenue base and they’re growing rapidly. Every one of these countries is growing at greater than 10%, and together they are growing at more than 20%. 
 
Now let me give you just a few examples of the kind of work we’re doing. We just announced a banking center to help the State Bank of Vietnam’s 77 lenders modernize their systems for wire transfer, treasury management and customer savings and credit card account management. 
Companies in countries that are new EU members, like Poland and Romania, are turning to IBM to help with the business transformation needed to attract foreign investment and support compliance with EU directives. 
 
And we’re seeing results -- this quarter we signed more than $1.4 billion in new domestic services contracts in India, another example of how we’re winning locally in the India market. And as I just mentioned, our Asia-Pacific regions ex-Japan grew revenue 20% and grew profit at double that rate. 
 
So we’re talking about real money, real growth, and a real impact on our business. 
Clearly our bets on the new global economy are paying off and we’ve improved our hand with a new organization and management structure that will take effect early in 2008 aimed at continuing to make the most of this opportunity. 
 
In short, we expect these rapidly growing markets to continue to fuel IBM’s revenue and profit engine in 2008 and into the future. 
 
Now let’s turn back to our fourth quarter performance and look at revenue by segment. Year-to-year growth was led by our two Services businesses. At 16% and 17% growth, this is the best performance in years. 
 
In Software, growth returned to double-digits. Branded middleware had a good quarter and these fast growing brands are now 58% of total Software revenue. 
 
Systems and Technology also improved from third quarter, driven by strength in POWER6 and storage.
 
Global Financing was up 8%, with good growth in sales of used equipment. We’ll address the details in the segment discussions but now let’s turn to expense. 
Total expense and other income increased 9%. With 10% revenue growth, our expense-to-revenue ratio improved three-tenths of a point year to year. Peeling back the 9% growth in the fourth quarter, approximately five points of growth was due to currency. We estimate that one point of the growth is acquisitions as we’ve effectively wrapped on the larger acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of last year. The remaining two points of growth are operational.
Now in this, we did cover two incremental expense items; first, the interest expense from our ASR, and second, growth in employee bonus compensation. Together, these two items impacted our expense growth by about four points. 
Our operational performance is the result of actions taken to manage spending in the current environment while continuing to invest in areas that will drive growth over time, especially in high growth markets. So as we enter 2008, we will continue to effectively manage our operational expense growth and at the same time, we will have an increase in expense for acquisitions as we close transactions in the first quarter. 
I’d like to remind you that we include all acquisition costs in our reported results, including the amortization of purchased intangibles. 
 
Let me mention three items that significantly impacted our profit growth this quarter. 
 
First, A/R Provisions were up about $100 million year to year. Our reserve coverage ended the year at 1.5%, consistent with third quarter and down a tenth of a point from December 2006. 
 
Second, bonus compensation to our employee non-executive population was up almost $300 million year to year. This reflects our strong finish to the year. It’s about half cost and half expense, so it impacted gross margin by five-tenths of a point year to year and as I just mentioned, contributed two points of expense growth. A majority of this impact will be reflected in our services segments, consistent with our population distribution. 
 
Third, retirement-related plans generated about $670 million of cost and expense in the quarter, an increase of about $75 million year to year. The retirement-related plans cost $2.6 billion for the full year, up about $170 million year to year. 
 
Now let me comment on the performance of our U.S. pension fund. Our investments returned 14%. Despite this strong performance, we will keep our expected long-term return at 8% for 2008. We will increase the discount rate to 6%, reflecting the current interest rate environment. In 2008, these assumptions together with other factors such as our pension plan redesigns will result in retirement-related expense of about $1.6 billion, a decrease of $950 million to $1 billion year to year.
Finally, in the fourth quarter our effective tax rate was 28%, consistent with the rate in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2007, IBM’s effective tax rate was 28.1%. 
Looking forward to 2008, we expect a rate of approximately 27.5%. The improved rate is the result of a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.
Before getting into the segment discussion, let me give you a snapshot of margins. Margin improvement was driven by margin expansion led by Systems and Technology and Software. Systems and Technology margin improved both gross and pretax margins substantially. Gross margins improved in every systems brand except System i. This is driven by our ongoing focus on reducing cost, mixing to higher end models within our brands, and the value of our new POWER6 products.
 
Software margin improvement reflects good revenue growth off of a relatively fixed cost base. Margin in Global Technology Services was up, driven by strong profit growth in SO and ITS, and good expense management. Global Business Services margins were down, though up for the year. The year-to-year decline in fourth quarter is primarily driven by the increase in employee bonus compensation costs associated with IBM’s strong performance for the year.
 
Now let’s turn to the segments, starting with Services 
 
Both Services segments delivered powerful results again this quarter. Total Services revenue was $14.9 billion, up 17% as reported and 10% at constant currency. We had double-digit revenue growth across all lines of business and profit growth of just over 19% with pretax margin of 10.6%. We believe both services businesses gained share this quarter. 
 
We had signings of $15.4 billion, with very strong performance to close out the year. Our short term signings were up 8%. Long term signings were down 25%, coming off a very strong fourth quarter of last year. Within this, we signed 17 deals larger than $100 million and our backlog increased to an estimated $118 billion, up $2 billion year to year and quarter to quarter. This strong quarter of signings enabled us to grow overall signings for the full year. 
 
Moving to Global Technology Services, total revenue was up 16% or 10% at constant currency. This was clearly the best performance we’ve seen in years for this unit. This is a reflection of the enormous transformation that has taken place over the past few years, including a revamping of the entire ITS portfolio around the globe, continued improvement in our Strategic Outsourcing service delivery, and a disciplined approach to driving new business in our existing accounts. GTS delivered double-digit revenue growth across all geographies, all sectors, and all lines of business. 
 
Strategic Outsourcing revenue was up 15%, while signings were down 26%. Revenue growth is benefiting from last year’s signings, the continued sales of new business into our existing accounts and good yield from 2007 new signings. 
 
Business Transformation Outsourcing is up 56% as reported. We had double-digit revenue growth in all geographies and we saw continued strength in our Daksh business, which was up over 40% year to year. Signings were up almost 150% and finished up 17% for the year. 
 
Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 11%. Signings this quarter were up 6%. We had good traction in our key ITS plays which include; Green Data Center, Server Management Services, and SOA. What these offerings all have in common is that they enable our customers to maximize the efficiency of their IT infrastructures, which can drive considerable cost savings. 
 
We were particularly encouraged by the signings performance of our Green 
Data Center services offerings that announced in the third quarter. These offerings enable our customers to maximize the power utilization of their data centers and reduce energy costs. We signed nearly $300 million in new business this quarter, with about half of that coming from the Financial Services Sector, where business volumes are driving an enormous amount of processing needs and power consumption. 
 
Maintenance revenue was up 16%. This growth includes the services provided to Ricoh Info Print, which contributed about seven points of growth in the quarter. This work will transition to Ricoh in 2008. 
 
Global Technology Services pretax profit was up 26% and margin was 10.2%, up nine-tenths of a point year to year. This margin expansion was driven by first, better cost structure in strategic outsourcing, a mix to higher value products in ITS, and very good expense management. 
 
Turning to Global Business Services, our revenue was up 17% as reported and up 10% at constant currency. GBS delivered record revenue and profit for both the quarter and the year, and exceeded its revenue growth model objectives for the full year for both the consulting and systems integration business and application management services. We’re seeing tremendous growth in our Application Management Services offerings and growth in our Global Resources, with revenue-generating headcount up 38% year to year. 
 
For the quarter we grew revenue in all geographies and all sectors and delivered double-digit growth across all consulting services lines, which include; Financial Management Services, Human Capital Management, CRM, Supply Chain, and Strategy and Change. 
Short term signings for GBS were up 9% for the quarter; $3.9 billion in short term signings is the highest level we’ve ever achieved. Long term signings were down 48% for the quarter, coming off a very strong quarter last year. Global Business Services pretax profit was up 9% and margin was 11.3%, down half-a-point year to year.
Although we delivered the highest level of pretax profit in history, margins were impacted by increased employee bonus compensation in the quarter, partially offset by improved expense productivity. 
 
To wrap up Services, I’ll comment on full year results. This is the strongest revenue performance since 2003 and we exceeded our model objectives for both revenue and profit growth. While these numbers aren’t on the chart, let me just give you a few key metrics for the full year. 
Revenue was up 12% as reported and 8% at constant currency. Pretax profit grew almost 13% and pretax margin expanded to 10%. We had short term signings growth of 5% and we closed the year with strong long term signings performance with a good portfolio of new signed contracts. Looking at the long term signings dynamics, there was a reduction in the deal length of our long term signings this year. The average duration of contracts signed in 2007 was 1.1 years shorter, or 17%, than those signed in 2006. So although long term signings were roughly flat for the year, the annualized revenue you get from these signings is up year to year. 
 
Looking to 2008, we have good momentum in short-term signings, a strong portfolio of high-value, cost-saving offerings, and a backlog of $118 billion. So overall, we have a very strong book of business heading into 2008. 
 
Now, let’s turn to Systems and Technology. This quarter, as I said earlier, the real story in Systems and Technology is profit, with margin expansion driving profit growth of 18%. Revenue of $6.8 billion declined 4% year to year but without the divested printer business, revenue was flat. Our strongest performance was in System p and Storage, offset by anticipated declines in System z and Microelectronics. 
 
Now, let me take you through the brands. System z revenue declined 15% year to year. Revenue grew double-digits in Asia-Pacific, offset by U.S. and parts of Europe. MIPS shipments were down 4% year to year, but MIPS on specialty engines grew 11%, up in every geography. 
 
Now, this marks the tenth quarter of a long and successful technology cycle for System z. In 2008 we’ll move to our next generation mainframe, with announcement and availability in late February. 
This next generation System z will have 50% more capacity than the current z9, it enables unprecedented levels of workload consolidation and extends mainframe’s leadership in energy efficiency, security and resiliency. 
We expect the first quarter to be a period of product transition, with the real benefit coming in the second quarter. 
 
System i grew 2% year to year with strong growth in POWER6 servers. 
 
System p was up 9% year to year, which was a very solid finish to the year. It’s our sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth driven by the POWER6 servers. 
 
All geographies grew revenue year to year, with particularly strong double-digit performance in Asia-Pacific. Now we expect to gain share with this performance and continue worldwide leadership position in the UNIX market. It’s our tenth consecutive quarter of leadership since taking the number one title in the second quarter of 2005 and we’ve gained 12 points of share since the introduction of POWER4 in 2002. 
Now later this quarter, we will announce and ship POWER6 technology in System p’s entry segment and extend POWER6 innovation and technology. The new POWER-based virtualization offerings will also be announced to extend IBM’s lead in UNIX virtualization, dramatically improving energy and space efficiency. 
 
System x server revenue grew 6% year to year and blades grew 31%. We had strong acceptance of our new BladeCenter-S which was introduced at the end of the quarter. This is a new datacenter in a box offering for SMB and distributed large enterprises. It offers value in integration, affordability, and the embedded capability for security and data protection. 
 
Our new high-end Quad-Core processor servers were also well received and sold out in the quarter. We expect System x servers held market share. 
 
In Storage, we had a very good quarter with revenue up 11%. We had another strong performance in Tape, up 22%. And this quarter total disk was up 7%, with 21% growth in the DS8000. 
 
Now recently we announced the acquisition of XIV, which will further strengthen our storage portfolio long term. This acquisition positions IBM to grow in emerging opportunities like Web 2.0 applications, digital archives and digital media, so we’re excited about this addition to our storage family. 
 
Retail Store Solutions was up 6% as we maintained our market leadership. Technology was down 11% year to year driven by a slowdown in game processors. As I’ve mentioned previously, the OEM business has minimal impact to IBM’s bottom line but this business is delivering great technology to our systems business, which is the fundamental objective of our investment. You can see it in the new product introductions for 2008. 
 
Now let me wrap up the Systems and Technology discussion where I started, with profit. Systems and Technology gross profit and pretax margins were up significantly year to year. For the year, pretax margin expanded over two points to 9.6%, reflecting a strong combination of operational cost management and the value that virtualization is driving in the enterprise space. 
 
Our Software business performed well. With strong execution, we had good success closing transactions in the quarter, driving double-digit revenue and profit growth. The Software segment revenue of $6.3 billion was up 12% year to year or 6% at constant currency, and this quarter our growth was primarily organic as we wrapped around our prior year’s acquisitions. The Software pretax profit grew 21%. Profit margin expanded about two and a half points to almost 35%. 
 
In both the fourth quarter and full year, excluding currency benefits, we grew double-digits in the financial services sector, public sector and SMB. Customers are using IBM middleware to effectively improve their operating leverage and business efficiency. Financial Services sector growth is particularly meaningful. We grew in Financial Services in every geography and grew double digits in the Americas and Asia. This is true for both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
 
Now let’s discuss our branded middleware. Key branded middleware delivered 15% growth. This represented 58% of software in the fourth quarter or 54% for the full year, so you can see some acceleration here. 
 
WebSphere software grew 23% as reported. This caps off a full year performance of 19% growth with strong performance tied to the industry’s adoption of services-oriented architecture. This turned out to be a great play for IBM. 
 
Information Management also grew double-digits in the fourth quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, we entered our second year of our Filenet acquisition. This has been very successful and drove strong revenue growth throughout the year. 
 
We’re working to close the Cognos acquisition in the first quarter of 2008. Cognos provides IBM a strong entry in the Business Intelligence marketplace. We expect this acquisition to provide synergies not only in software but also in services, servers and storage. 
 
Our Tivoli business grew 19% in the quarter. We had double-digit growth in each segment of the Tivoli portfolio, Systems Management, Security and Storage. 
 
Lotus software grew 7% compared to a very strong fourth quarter of 2006. It delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of growth for a very strong performance. Lotus Connections, our social software for business which was released in June, has been rapidly adopted by our customers and this helps solidify IBM’s leadership position in the collaboration marketplace. So some pretty exciting offerings from our Lotus operations 
 
Our Rational grew 22%. Our largest customers embraced our integrated product set and we expect our Telelogic acquisition to close in the first quarter subject to completion of regulatory reviews. Telelogic’s suite of systems programming tools complements Rational’s IT tool set and further enables software tool sales into industries like communications and automotive. 
 
Now we have been investing heavily in our Software business for some time, both internally and through targeted acquisitions, and in 2007 we generated $20 billion of software revenue, up 10%, and 6% at constant currency. Software pretax profit grew 9% for the year, or about a $0.5 billion, and that’s after covering amortization of intangibles for key acquisitions. The pretax margin for the year was effectively flat, reflecting the integration of these acquired businesses. 
 
Now let’s turn to IBM’s cash flow performance. For the year, we generated free cash flow of $12.4 billion, a $1.9 billion increase from last year. This year-to-year cash performance was driven by growth in our net income, lower pension funding, and improved working capital. 
DSO improved 1.4 days year to year to the best level in years and net inventory also improved, so it was very good performance across the board driving our cash flow for 2007. 
We continued to fund capital investments required for long term growth with $5 billion of expenditures in the year. 
 
Full year 2007 had record returns to shareholders. Our 2007 share repurchase was $18.8 billion, including $12.5 billion repurchased in an accelerated share repurchase in May. In December we announced an additional plan to repurchase up to $1 billion in stock. Under the new trading plan, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for about $220 million. Average diluted shares year-to-date were 1.5 billion, down 6.6% from a year ago.
Turning to dividends, this year we distributed $2.1 billion, an increase of almost $500 million year to year, driven by a 33% dividend increase announced in April. We have doubled our dividend per share in the last two years. Since 1995, we have returned to investors over $108 billion through share repurchase and dividends. 
 
Now let’s turn to the balance sheet. Cash on hand is $16.1 billion, a record level driven by strong earnings. You can expect cash balance will decline as we close the Cognos and Telelogic acquisitions in the first quarter. 
 
Seventy-percent of our $35 billion of debt is to support our global financing business, leveraged at 7.1 to 1. The other 30% of debt, the non-global financing debt, increased $10.3 billion year to year driven by the debt to support the ASR. It is down almost $800 million since September and together with a large increase in equity, translated to another decline in debt-to-cap. Our ratio is now 30%, down from a peak of 47% at the end of the second quarter. 
 
Overall we returned $21 billion to investors while retaining a book equity of $28.5 billion, so we have a very strong balance sheet and cash position as we enter 2008. 
 
So let me wrap up the quarter by showing you the drivers of our earnings growth, starting with revenue. Our global reach, together with exceptional performance in Services, resulted in revenue growth of 10%. Now at constant mix and margin, this would contribute $0.22 of the $0.54 of year-to-year EPS growth. 
We expanded our gross margin, led by Systems and Technology, and good performance in Software. We continued our focus on expense management, and yielded productivity in the quarter, which contributed about a dime, and while we had additional interest expense related to our ASR, an impact of about $0.06, we generated a significant benefit of $0.22 from our aggressive share repurchases earlier in the year.
So to net it out, with strong performance in our global businesses and substantial operating leverage, we delivered very strong earnings per share growth of 24%. This is a very powerful close to 2007 but I would say it’s also a very strong starting position for 2008. 
So let me take a minute and give you a snapshot of our key performance metrics for the year. We delivered 8% revenue growth, led by Services and Software. We grew net income 11% and expanded net margin by 20 basis points to 10.5%. Now remember this includes interest expense for the ASR, so without the ASR interest, net income grew 13% and net margin expanded by 50 basis points. 
 
With an aggressive share repurchase program in 2007, earnings per share grew 18% and free cash flow, driven by the growth in net income along with lower pension funding and working capital improvements, was also up 18%, so this resulted in record levels of revenue, profit, and cash. 
 
The IBM business model is designed to drive sustainable profit and cash performance over the long term and in 2007 we delivered against that model. So we enter 2008 with an outstanding operating and financial position. 
First, we have a strong portfolio of products and services. Our Services business enters the year with $118 billion of backlog and a complement of offerings and capabilities that deliver both high value and productivity to clients. Software continues to capitalize on industry imperatives such as SOA and information on demand and in our Systems business, our Unix and storage performance is strong, with a number of key product introductions in 2008, including our new mainframe in late February and the introduction of POWER6 to the rest of Systems p and i product lines in the first and second quarters. 
 
Second, we have a significant base of business in fast-growing economies. We talked about that earlier in the presentation and I gave you a map so you could conceptualize this, but in the fourth quarter 65% of our revenue was outside of the U.S. Countries growing more than 10% in local currency in the fourth quarter made up 22% of our revenue base, and these countries collectively grew more than 20%. So we’ve been investing for years to drive this performance and we’ll continue to invest to capture this growth. 
 
Third, our operating model is in place and executing well. Our annuity businesses, which drive about half of our revenue, provide a solid base of profit and cash. We have expanded margins for four consecutive years and have the ability to continue to generate higher returns and we have a disciplined approach to aligning investments to growth. So just as we are aggressively investing in high growth markets, we are also taking a more measured approach in the more stable markets. 
 
Fourth, we’re continuing to invest in our acquisition strategy and have been successful in bringing technologies and businesses into IBM that we leverage across our enterprise. 
 
Finally, we generate a lot of cash, and we’ve got a very solid balance sheet with debt-to-cap now at 30%, and $16.1 billion of cash on hand at the end of the year. We have substantial flexibility to make investments where we see the best opportunities. 
 
So we feel good about how our business is positioned as we enter 2008. 
 
With the strength in our global businesses, our broad portfolio of offerings, a solid operating model, and strong financial position, we believe that we can deliver earnings per share growth of 15% to 16% in 2008. This would result in an EPS range of $8.20 to $8.30. And with this strong performance, we are on track to our 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 of earnings per share. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to remind you of a couple of items. 
First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark’s prepared remarks. Second, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I’ll turn the call back to Mark for some final remarks. 
Operator, please open it up for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns. 
Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns
Mark, you went through a lot of this in your call and different reasons why things are more defensive for IBM, but perhaps you could give us a sense about what -- how comfortable you can be given the situation appears economically to deteriorate and I guess what sort of plans you have in place if things were to deteriorate. Maybe just sort of a general comment about how you look at things, why you are still comfortable, since you made that forecast under a vastly different economic scenario. Give us your thoughts on that. 
Mark Loughridge
Sure, Andy. First of all, I would like to answer this kind of in the sense of headwinds and tailwinds as we go into ’08, so I agree with you. We have an uncertain economic environment that we are working through along with the rest of the business world. For us, in addition we have the amortization of intangibles for the acquisitions we did. We also have the interest from the ASR that we’ve still but as we go into 2008, we also have a lot of tailwinds. 
So number one, we have a very strong position going into 2008 from our pension business. You know, we’ve been wrestling with pension for some years. In fact, over the last five years, that’s increased on us year by year to what is a total of about $3 billion. 
Now, for the first time we get a benefit on a year-to-year basis and that came in just short of $1 billion. So obviously that’s a very strong tailwind. 
Secondly, as we explained in the text, we have a good tax plan as we go into 2008. I would say that’s a good tailwind as well. We have the share repurchase benefits from last year’s ASR. I think that’s certainly a very strong tailwind as well. 
But I think more importantly, we have a very good operational platform as we go into 2008. First of all, strong services momentum and a strong annuity base, and I can’t emphasize enough, you know, if you are going into an uncertain climate like this, that annuity base is a tremendous advantage for us. 
We have a strong geographic mix. I think we spent a lot of time today talking about that but you could see that we were able to find a good 50 countries with double-digit growth in the globe because we are in 170, and I think that geographic mix is a real advantage for us here. 
Third, we have good productivity and cost take-outs. Fourth, we have a strong set of offerings that I think provide real value and cost-savings for our customers, tailored to this kind of an environment. And lastly, we have new products that are coming to market, the new z product, POWER6, and good acquisitions in Cognos, Telelogic, and XIV. 
So I think we have a very balanced outlook and I think we have a good plan. 
Now, as far as if things deteriorate, the second part of your question, as we go into next year, we’ve not banked on substantially improved performance out of our large established geographies, so I think we’ve already baked some of this in on a relatively conservative basis. We are counting on maintaining that momentum we saw, however, across our business lines and in these high growth countries. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Andy. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with UBS. 
Benjamin Reitzes - UBS
Good afternoon, thanks. Just a little more on the economy, if you don’t mind. 70% to 75% of your sales come from Europe and the U.S., and just a little bit more color on what you are expecting there with regard to -- maybe within your top line and what not as you go throughout the year. In particular, are you expecting the same kind of performance as you had in the fourth quarter in that guidance of 820 to 830 out of the U.S. and Europe? Or are you expecting some deterioration?
Mark Loughridge
Well, I would like to answer that first by going through the business units and within that, I’ll answer your question by geography. But first of all, let’s look at this I think by segment. 
Services, we have a pretty powerful performance again this quarter, a very large annuity base and the benefits of both long and short-term signings with a backlog of $118 billion, we’re up $2 billion year to year and we believe that services performance in the first half of ’08 should be similar for our full year 2007 results really for both GVS and GTS. 
And I want to emphasize as we went through what I think was a pretty strong signings quarter that short-term signings showed real momentum here at plus 8%. And secondly, within our long-term signings, as we explained on the call, the duration was reduced by about a year, which makes about 17% difference in the yield of those signings, so I think on services as we go into the first half, we’ve got a very strong position. 
Secondly, in our hardware business, we are going to benefit now as we go into a new product cycle. First of all, we have the new system z that’s going to announce NGA at the end of February, and you’ll hear more about that as we proceed towards the announcement but that’s a very exciting event for us, and I think as you look at the z performance, we should get closer in the first quarter, which is kind of a quarter transition, to relatively a flat low single digit, moving into the second quarter where we should see growth and I think real strength in the second half. And don’t forget we have our new POWER6 products as well. 
So we expect to see improved system performance in 2008 to mid single digit range on the system base. I don’t really think we’re going to see a recovery in our micro business until the second half, however, but I do expect good performance out of our system business. 
In software, we really have a very good portfolio of offerings. Over the long term, I’d say we are comfortable with the software growth model we presented to you in 2007. You’ll remember that revenue growth model was 7% to 10%, 10 to 12 TTI growth. So for the first half of 2008, we expect a softer revenue performance to be similar to what we had for the full year 2007. 
Now I would add to that the growth that we’ll get from both the Cognos and Telelogic acquisitions when they close. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Ben. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein

Thank you. You talked about your strong cash balance repeatedly on the call. Historically you’ve repurchased $8 billion to $12 billion a year in shares outside of the ASR that you did last year. What is the planning assumption that you have embedded in your 820 to 830 number for share repurchases and how much flexibility do you have to take that up if the shares provide an even stronger entry point to repurchase?
Mark Loughridge
Good question, Tony. First of all, as you know, the share repurchase is a power reserved for the Board of Directors, so when the Board makes a decision, then that very same day, we will announce to the market. So I can’t tell you exactly what the board decision will be, obviously, but I can give you a feeling for my assumptions going into the year. 
As you referenced, we really do have a substantial cash position and cash generation capabilities. I mean, it could not have been much stronger in the quarter on both sides. As well as we look forward and certainly as I look forward in today’s market, I think IBM has an attractive valuation. 
So we certainly have the capability for a larger-than-normal run-rate repurchase program in 2008, though certainly not as large as last year’s $19 billion. But could it be larger than the normal run-rate? Sure. But as I said earlier to this, this is a power reserved for the board of directors and when we have that decision, I’ll certainly -- we’ll be announcing that to the market. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tony. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
Thanks very much. Well, I’m struggling to come up with anything but Mark, I was hoping that you could hopefully talk about the puts and takes, or actually the factors that would cause seasonality to be different than normal seasonality, both in terms of revenue and profit performance throughout the year in 2008. In other words, what are the things we should be thinking about, the puts and takes to think about for the first quarter?
Mark Loughridge
I think if you look at the annualization, the quarter distribution of that guidance, I think really the anomaly for your models is 2007 because we had the accelerated share repurchase and the interest associated with that. So to look for a seasonality model, I would really use 2006 as a better example of a more typical distribution and I think that’s just about the same distribution that you have currently in your average models. But I think 2006 is a better example of more even distribution across the quarters. 2007 is probably the anomaly here. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Rich. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Shope with J.P. Morgan. 
Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan
Thanks. I guess this question is going to be somewhat related to the macro outlook again but I really wanted to just understand a little better how you modeled the EPS guidance. When you looked at this growth outlook excluding the pension benefit and the tax benefit, how sensitive are your bottom line assumptions to any unexpected changes to top line growth?
I guess what I am really asking is similar to previous questions, what measures do you have in place or in your mind to counter any unexpected changes in the top line growth pattern based on how you modeled this?
Mark Loughridge
First of all, let’s talk about sensitivity in our model. So I think one good way to do that, let’s discuss how sensitive we might be to a downturn in FSS in the U.S. In FSS, you know that it runs about 28% of IBM and about 25% of that is in the U.S., so if you take that 25 of 28, obviously you get a percentage of 7% in the U.S. Forty-percent of that is transaction based, so that leaves about 3%. So if you looked at first half revenue and a range of $45 billion to $50 billion is probably a logical range, but let’s just use 50 for simple math, that would give us about $1.4 billion, at 60% margins of $800 million, so if you had a 10% decline in that area in FSS, that would be an impact of about $100 million. 
Now obviously that kind of an impact is certainly within the scope that we could handle as a general base of doing business. 
The interesting thing though, if you look at that performance, and again I’m going to go back to FSS, really FSS had pretty good performance in the quarter. Remember, it was up 5% but short-term signings for FSS were up 22% and variances interestingly, short-term signings in the U.S. were up 78% at $0.5 billion. 
So while I think that we have a strong base of business moving into 2008 and the capability, given our annuity platform to handle these perturbations, I’d also add from my perspective based on the short-term signings momentum, we also have some momentum picking up as we exit the year moving into 2008. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Bill. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. Given the macro backdrop and the momentum that you have going into ’08, how should we think about the potential for services signing growth in ’08?
Mark Loughridge
Well, you know, let’s put them in their two categories. Long-term signings are really relatively unpredictable by quarter. I mean, they don’t distribute uniformly across the quarter but I think as we look at short-term signings, we should see the same level of mid single digit short-term signings from our services businesses certainly as we go through the first half of 2008. 
So I think we will continue to see momentum out of those units and as we said, I think if you wanted to get a feeling for what we are looking at for signings for the first half, I think it would be more similar to the full year of ’08 -- of ’07, excuse me. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with Cohen. 
Louis Miscioscia - Cohen
Great. Maybe since you’ve been through a couple of downturns, and I hate to ask another macro question, but can you compare the last couple that you’ve seen or even going back to 2001, obviously IBM shares did hold in very well in 2001 but obviously broke and went down 50% in 2002. 
Mark Loughridge
Good question. You know, we thought about -- or I know I -- our organization thought about this a lot but I think the distinction as I recall the last downturn was really characterized by over-capacity and I don’t see that as being the issue as we go into 2008. I don’t think this is a framework structured around over-capacity. 
I think as we go into this year, it would be different and I also think as you move into 2008, we are structuring our offerings to solve problems that our customers will be looking at -- problems to take costs out of the business, problems to solve capital problems, solutions to drive cash flow and solve their capital constraints. 
I think the risks and issues that you might foresee are going to be different than the last downturn and I think in this framework it’s important to structure your offerings to solve those problems. 
And as I look at the short-term signings growth that we achieved in the fourth quarter, I think that is very much the reason we saw that growth. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Lou. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Good evening. How do the margins compare in the 22% of revenues coming from emerging regions versus the revenue base in the U.S. and Europe? 
Mark Loughridge
I am not going to go through the margin breakdown specifically but I think you can get a pretty good framework for that from a couple of different vantage points. Number one, you’ll remember when we were talking about the BRIC countries last year. We said they are about 5% of our total revenue mix. And actually, the profit underneath those BRIC countries was a larger percentage of our profit mix. So the BRIC countries were 5% of the mix in ’07 but a larger percent of our overall profitability was moved forward. 
The second thing I’d say is if you look at this AP organization, Asia-Pacific for us, so that includes Australia and New Zealand, but if you look at that Asia-Pacific organization excluding Japan as a more established country, that organization grew its revenue 20% but it grew profitability over 40%. 
Now why did that organization drive such high level of profit growth? It’s because as we drive our business equation there, we are really applying that to very large infrastructure offerings. This is not commoditized content. This is not low margin, volume based content. This is infrastructure based at very high margins and that is a big component of the year-to-year growth rate of profit for this Asia-Pacific ex Japan region, outstripping the revenue growth by a factor of two. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Katy. Let’s take one more question please, Operator.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. 
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks very much. I’m going to ask the what’s embedded in expectations question one more time. If I back out the pension benefit and make an assumption around buy-back, it looks like you are expecting the base business to grow earnings somewhere around 5%, maybe 6%. Can you comment if that’s true, first off? And secondly, what type of global IT spending growth do you think we need to get to that level of underlying earnings growth? Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge
First of all, if you look at the growth rate of what I’d call the operational content, I would have placed it higher than that, Chris, first of all because number one, we’ve got to absorb the Cognos Telelogic content and the foregone interest expense as well as the interest against the ASR, and those two together by my math, about five points, so I would have put this much higher than your number and I think we do have a good operational framework going forward. 
As far as the IT spend rate going forward, we are not counting on a resurgence of IT spend beyond what we saw in the fourth quarter and I think to characterize, we would think the first half of next year would look relatively similar with higher growth rates in these high growth emerging countries and more stability in the more established countries. 
And we have prepared ourselves for that in the way that we’ve built our budgets going into 2008. We’ve been very disciplined about expense management in the established countries, looking for productivity out of our country management, whereas in these growth environments we are moving very rapidly on investment to capture that growth and that was, frankly, a big part of the reason we established this new growth market organization. 
Because that organization is now comprised of all growth countries and we are going to manage those distinctly and separately from a more established business model. 
So I think that answers the question. Let me now just take a moment to wrap up. 
First of all, to close out, I realize that this is a challenging environment with economic uncertainty but I think there is still a lot of opportunities for growth and I think we explored many of those on the call today. 
I think what I would like to describe is what I think makes IBM different in this environment and I have five points to make. 
So first, global reach -- we are in 170 countries on a globalized basis and I think you have to have that kind of well-tuned investment discipline to find the 50 growth countries with total growth in excess of 10%. Now these are small countries but in total, they are large. It was 22% of our business growing greater than 20%. 
What’s a good example of this? In India, we just about achieved -- we almost achieved $1 billion in revenue but I think more interesting, we did $1.4 billion in signings for local clients. That’s not signings to satisfy the rest of the globe from India. That’s $1.4 billion of signings for our local clients, so I would point to global reach as our first differentiator. 
Second, a proven infrastructure provider -- now you know we know how to do this very well. We’ve built the infrastructure in most countries now considered to have mature economies and we have a solid track record which makes us the trusted partners for these new, rapidly expanding markets. The best example there I think is AP excluding Japan, the revenue is up 20% but the profits are up more than 40% because this is a big value-added infrastructure business versus a commodity business. 
Third, our product and services portfolio delivers value to the enterprise and we are not in the commodity volume business -- we are in the business to drive solutions to our customers that tailor to their needs. Here I have I think a different example -- if you look at this green data center. Sometimes we look at it and say well, that’s simply a cost savings, or maybe that’s a soft environmental description of that offering. And actually, this is a very, very specific offering. We did $300 million in green data center signings in the fourth quarter and 40% of those were in FSS. Now, why is that?
Well frankly, many of these data centers, not only did they need to reduce costs as a function of their business equations but some of them are simply out of electricity and that’s not a situation that’s going to change soon and they cannot run their business and expand capacity without solving that fundamental problem. 
And there are other examples -- security and resiliency. These problems are market agnostic and clients still need to protect their data and keep their operations running. Cost reduction and capital assurance, whether it’s virtualization, BTO, financing, strategic outsourcing, we have a broad portfolio of alternatives for our clients who need to find ways to stop spending on non-core business and shore up their balance sheet. 
So I think these are just a few reasons that our FSS short-term signings in the fourth were so strong, even in the U.S. at $0.5 billion, up 78% year to year. 
Fourth, we have been continuously investing in capability and have leadership technology and I think our ’08 lineup is very powerful. From the new z and POWER6 technologies to introducing our new acquisitions, XIV, Cognos, and Telelogic. 
And fifth, lastly we have the capital which gives us the financial flexibility to invest despite this near-term business climate, and we have a large annuity content to our business which is much lower risk than a solely transaction dependent business model. 
So I want to thank you all for joining us today and now it’s on to 2008.

Thanks for joining us today. This quarter, I want to give you an assessment of the quarter right upfront. We'll discuss what went well, where we could have done better and what it means for the full year. 
Let me start with areas where we had really strong performance. Both services businesses were outstanding, with the best overall revenue growth in four years. Performance was broad-based in all categories, with growth in every geography, every sector and every line of business. 
Global Technology Services revenue was up 13%; profit was up 26%. Global Business Services revenue was up 16% and profit was up 29%. These results reflect a number of actions that we have been taking to accelerate our revenue growth while improving our profitability, and we expect this momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. So we had a great quarter in our services businesses. 
In software, we had good performance in small and medium-sized transactions, but several large contracts didn't close at the end of the quarter, so frankly we could've done better here. In the fourth quarter, we expect improved software revenue performance and double-digit profit growth. 
In Systems and Technology, we were impacted by product transitions and tough compares in System z. Revenue was down 10%, or 6% excluding the divested printer business. We will look for a typical sequential improvement from third to fourth quarter, but relatively flat performance year to year without printers, and then a return to growth in the first quarter of 2008. 
Growth by sector varied. Public sector was very strong, but financial services sector experienced a slowdown in September. We will talk about this more, later in the call. 
The performance across our geographies was more balanced. Asia's strong performance continued, up 9%. Europe's growth was solid, up 11%, and Americas was up 4%. Overall, the IBM business model delivered earnings per share growth of 16%. 
As we saw the quarter develop, we took the right actions to manage our way through an uncertain economic environment, including a disciplined focus on spending and productivity while maintaining investments in high-growth areas. All in all, we feel good about meeting our earnings objectives in the third quarter and we remain on track for the full year. 
Now let's turn to the income statement. First of all, we delivered revenue of $24.1 billion, an increase of 7% as reported and 3% at constant currency. Our gross margin was down 0.7 points. About two-thirds of this decline is due to mix shift among the segments and about a third is due to lower margin in our software business. 
Expense was up 6%. This is a substantial improvement from our recent quarters and the result of the actions we've taken to manage spending and drive productivity. Pretax income was up 3%, but up 8% excluding the additional interest expense for the ASR. 
We recorded a tax rate of 28% and net income up 6%, and if you exclude the additional interest expense, net income was up 11% and margin up four-tenths. Our share count was down 8%. There was no incremental share repurchase in the quarter, obviously, following a significant ASR in the second quarter. Bottom line, we delivered $1.68 of EPS, growth of 16% year to year. That puts us on a year-to-date basis through September with earnings per share also up 16% and a solid contribution delivering on our roadmap for 2010. 
Now let's start peeling back our revenue, and we will start with geographic revenue and then look at the sector dynamics. The Americas revenue growth was 3% at constant currency. Our U.S. growth was also 3%, with differentiation by sector. We had strength in public sector, which was up double-digits. However, we had weakness in financial services sector, down year to year. 
Europe had more steady performance. It was up 11% as reported and 4% at constant currency. Most major countries were up at constant currency led by Germany and Spain, which were each up over 5%. The market environment continues at a moderate IT spend. 
Asia Pacific again had our best performance at constant currency, up 9% as reported and 6% at constant currency. Asia Pacific economy remains strong, led by India, China and Australia/New Zealand. We had solid contribution from all of these regions, where we continue to accelerate our investment. 
Japan's revenue, at approximately one-half of Asia-Pacific revenue, was essentially flat. In Japan, the growth that we have seen in services and software continues, but it was mitigated by declines in our systems business. 
Emerging countries are leading growth in the global economies. In the third quarter, our revenue in Brazil, Russia, India and China grew 19% as reported and 10% at constant currency. Three of the four countries continued very strong growth. China and Russia were both up over 20% at constant currency, and India once again was up over 30%. Brazil declined, however this quarter at constant currency after double-digit growth in third quarter last year; so it was more an issue of compares than performance.
We remain committed to driving growth in excess of the market rate in these emerging countries over the long term, with an objective of doubling the revenue by 2010. Given our performance this year, we are on track to this objective. IBM's geographic mix provides diversification and the ability to capitalize on these fast-growing emerging markets. 
Now let's spend a minute on revenue by sector. I think the dynamics provide some perspective on our overall revenue performance. We have several key sectors, the largest of those being the financial sector, SMB and public. The strongest performance came from public sector, and growth has been fairly consistent over the course of the year. We had solid growth in government, health care and education, with broad-based strength in government, which is the largest of the three. We're seeing increased demand as federal, state and local government agencies are investing in IT for operational efficiencies. 
The weakest sector performance was in the financial services sector. By geography, the impact was most pronounced in the U.S. By brand, the largest impact was in System z, facing a difficult compare. Outside of this, financial services sector revenue performed in a more typical range. 
As we move into the fourth quarter, the focus will be on closing deferred deals and new fourth quarter opportunities, and we will also capitalize on opportunities in other sectors, leveraging our broader capabilities. 
So now let's move on to expense. Total expense and other income increased 6%, but we had modest year-to-year improvement in our expense to revenue ratio. There was substantial improvement to growth rates over the last two quarters however; the result of actions we've taken to manage spending in the current environment. Now last quarter I told you that we expected between 7% and 9% growth in expense in the second half, but we frankly did even better than that in the third quarter with 6% growth. If you peel back the 6% growth in the third quarter, you will see that approximately 3 points of the growth was due to currency; I estimate about 5 points from the growth is acquisitions, so as a result, what I will call operational expense was 2% better year to year. Remember, this includes the incremental interest expense from the ASR. 
So how did we do that? Well, first, in the middle of last year, you know we started to ramp investments and resources in software and services and emerging markets. But I think in a sense we funded these investments through a very disciplined approach to expense management. We focused on driving productivity from our sales teams as well as our support functions. 
If you take my function, by the way, the finance area, 40% of our resources will be in global support centers by the end of next year. We have also tightly managed our discretionary spending, while continuing to invest in areas that will drive growth over time, especially in emerging countries. 
I want to mention one item that significantly impacted our profit growth this quarter; our retirement-related plans generated about $650 million of cost and expense in the quarter, an increase of almost $60 million year to year. 
Finally, our tax rate was 28% this quarter, down slightly from the first half rate. 
Moving on to cash flow, our year-to-date free cash flow was $5.2 billion, a $1.2 billion increase from last year. Our year-to-year cash performance was driven by growth in net income and lower funding actions for retirement-related plans. In the quarter, our free cash flow was $2.6 billion, down about $100 million sequentially, but we maintained our capital investments required for our long-term growth. 
Year-to-date through September, we returned $20 billion to investors through share repurchase and dividends. Share repurchase is obviously on hold during the quarter as the ASR remains in the covering period. We settled our first of the three contracts this quarter for outflow of about $150 million, and our average diluted shares year-to-date were $1.5 billion, down 6.2% from a year ago. We also distributed $1.6 billion in dividends. 
So now let's turn to the balance sheet. Cash on hand is $13.8 billion, driven by continued strong earnings, with no share repurchase this quarter. Two-thirds of the $35.3 billion of debt is to support our global financing business leverage at an appropriate 6.8:1. The other third of our debt, the non-global financing debt, decreased $300 million. This brings our debt to cap from 47% to 40% in one quarter. Now, we expect to maintain that leverage on a long-term basis in the range of 20% to 30% debt to capital, and we have made good progress towards managing leverage to our target range. 
This quarter, we paid off $500 million of the $11.5 billion term loan associated with the ASR and refinanced $4.6 billion, with $2.6 billion of term debt and $2 billion of commercial paper. 
We have very good access to the credit markets and we benefit from the market's flight to quality. Let me give you an example. We can issue one-month commercial paper now at 30 basis points below LIBOR. Our ability to access long-term debt in the capital markets also remains strong. For example, this quarter we issued a $3 billion, ten-year bond. It is the largest single debt issuance for IBM, and credit investors were very supportive of our issue. It was oversubscribed by a multiple of two. The balance sheet remains strong, and we are positioned to support the business over the long term. 
Now, before going into each of the segments, I want to give you an overview. You can see the strength in the services segment mitigated by declines in the systems and technology segment. Our pretax margin for the sum of the segments is up three-tenths of a point year to year, excluding the incremental interest expense for the ASR, which is held at the IBM level. 
We will now start with the segment details, starting with Global Services. Both services segments delivered powerful results for this quarter: double-digit revenue growth, profit growth of 27% and pretax margin approaching 11%. Total services revenue was $13.7 billion, up 14% as reported and 10% at constant currency. 
Signings were $11.8 billion, up 12% year to year. Long-term signings were up 29%, while short-term signings were down 5%. Nine deals were larger than $100 million, and the backlog remains at $116 billion, up $7 billion year to year. This was a very good quarter for services, and we've made considerable progress implementing our strategies across our global offerings. 
Starting with Global Business Services, revenue was up 16% as reported and up 12% at constant currency. Transformational actions we've taken over the past two years are paying off in a big way, and driving profitable growth. We're benefiting from trailing 12-month short-term signings growth of 6% and long-term growth of over 80%.
We had growth in all geographies and all sectors. Looking at the sectors we saw the strongest performance in Communications, Distribution, Public and SMB. From an offering perspective, Financial Management Services, Human Capital Management and Supply Chain were the strongest. We're also making good progress in our AMS business, and we continue to have success building out our global capabilities. We believe we've gained share this quarter in both core consulting and application management services.
Global Business Services pre-tax profit was up nearly 30% and margin was 10.7%, -- an improvement of 1.3 points year-to-year. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Margin expansion was primarily driven by ongoing productivity and utilization initiatives, and good expense management.
Now, turning to Global Technology Services, total revenue was up 13% and 9% at constant currency. It was the best performance in some time. GTS delivered double-digit revenue growth across all geographies, all sectors and all lines of business.
Strategic Outsourcing revenue was up 10%. Signings were up 46%. Revenue growth is benefiting from three areas: good signings performance over the past 12 months, continued lower erosion which is a reflection of our focus on delivery capabilities, and sales of new business into our existing accounts.
Business Transformation Outsourcing is up 27% as reported, though signings were down 66%. As mentioned in the past, these signings can be very inconsistent by quarter.
Our Integrated Technology Services revenue is up 15% while signings were down 3%. The revenue growth we've seen the last few quarters has been driven primarily by signings growth in 2006 and the first half of 2007. The acquisition of Internet Security Systems also contributed to the revenue growth in the quarter.
Our Maintenance business was up 13%. This growth includes the services provided to Ricoh InfoPrint, which contributed about 7 points of growth in the quarter. Our Global Technology Services pre-tax profit was up 26%, and margin was 10.8%, up 1.2 points year-to-year and up 2.2 points sequentially. A very strong performance. When you look at margin expansion, it was really driven by benefits from restructuring, productivity improvements and good revenue growth.
Let's conclude with a discussion of the broad-based improvements that the services teams have made in the past few years. Within Global Technology Services, we revamped the ITS business around the globe, driving improved revenue performance. We strengthened the SO business; this is reflected in signings growth, lower levels of erosion and growth from our existing customers, creating a much stronger portfolio of business. And more recently, GTS tackled the margin issue, not only improving year-to-year but getting overall margin above 10%.
Within Global Business Services, over the past few years the GBS team has implemented a transformation of their operations, designed to improve profitability and position the business for profitable growth. This included restructuring actions in under-achieving regions, deployment of global resources management tools, rapid growth of our Global Delivery Centers, and increased focus on deal selectivity.
The result has been consistent improvements in utilization, better contract quality and increased profit margins. And as we've seen in the past few quarters, profitable growth. We feel great about how this business is now positioned. This is the best all around Services performance that we've seen in a long time.
Systems and Technology revenue of $4.9 billion was down 10% year-to-year, or 13% at constant currency. Without the divested printer business, revenue was down 6% year-to-year. In the third quarter, many of our servers were impacted by product transitions: System z is well into a very successful product cycle, Systems p and i are transitioning to POWER 6, and System x awaits new quad-core processors from Intel and AMD.
Let me take you through the brands. The biggest change from recent performance was in System z, with revenue down 31% and MIPS down 21%. Like I said upfront, we were up against a particularly strong third quarter of 2006, which had revenue growth of 25%.
We knew we had tough compares going into the quarter, and we had opportunities lined up to drive better performance, but a number of these large deals simply didn’t close in September.
We have had a long and successful technology cycle in System z, with eight consecutive quarters of MIPS growth. We continue to work with our customers to help them manage their computing requirements, and provide attractive migration offerings to transition to the next generation. System p grew 6% and really did pretty well, with particular strength in Americas and AP.
Strength in the new POWER6 midrange server helped drive the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. System p continues to leverage POWER technology leadership, gaining 11 points of share since 2001.
System x servers grew 6%, and blades grew 8%. Customers in the high-end of x are evaluating the new quad-core processors which are scheduled for fourth quarter availability. In addition to these new high end servers, our recently announced BladeCenter S for the SMB marketplace will be available in the fourth quarter.
In Storage, tape had another good quarter, up over 7%, while disk declined 3%, primarily in the midrange. Total Storage revenue was up 1%. Storage hardware is really a part of a larger total storage solution, and some of the value in these solutions has been evolving in other segments. As an example, storage software, which is in Tivoli, grew 16% this quarter. 
With 29% growth, our market leadership in Retail Store Solutions was extended again this quarter. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of share gains. 
Microelectronics revenue was down, driven again by game processors. We continue to pursue opportunities in other high growth segments.
When you look at gross profit margin in Systems and Technology, it was up three tenths of a point, with the largest contribution coming from System p. We also had margin expansion in Systems z and x.
In System z, we’ve reduced cost, as well as driving a more profitable product mix, to improve our gross profit margins despite the revenue decline.
Gross margin expansion in System x was driven by improved supply chain execution, which also resulted in faster delivery times and lower inventory.
Pre-tax margin was up quarter-to-quarter but down slightly year-to-year.
So to sum up Systems and Technology: we have product transitions underway and, in addition, we had a number of deals that did not close in the quarter. In System z, we are helping our customers move to the new technology by developing attractive migration offerings. With these actions and product enhancements, we are looking for more stable performance in the fourth quarter, and improved performance in the first quarter of 2008.
Software segment revenue of $4.7 billion was up 7% as reported and 3% at constant currency. Branded middleware grew 8%, 4% at constant currency. Now remember that branded middleware faced a strong compare; the prior year was up 20%.
So let me peel back the performance by transaction size. If you look at small deals, under a half million, and medium-sized deals, $500K to a million, we had good success in closing these transactions. But a number of large deals did not close in the quarter. Even a handful of these would have made a difference in the quarter. Now, we're still pursuing these and they remain opportunities for us in the fourth quarter.
Now, let me go through the brands. WebSphere grew 10% driven by deployments of web-enabled applications and SOA, while Information Management grew 9%. Tivoli grew 5% against 44% growth in 3Q06. Storage virtualization software did particularly well, and customers are benefiting from significant storage efficiency improvements.
Lotus grew 9% with double-digit growth in our Notes Domino product family. This is the 12th consecutive quarter of revenue growth for our Lotus group. Our latest version of Lotus Notes, Lotus Notes 8.0, was delivered this quarter. Rational grew 3%; the performance and functional testing software did well, reflecting the strength of our internally developed product set.
We're also continuing to invest in software as we've completed four acquisitions this quarter: Watchfire in Rational, Princeton Softech and Data Mirror in Information Management, and WebDialogs in Lotus. Software PTI margin declined reflecting the impact of acquisitions.
With our strong product set and deal pipeline entering the quarter, we expect significant improvement in the fourth quarter.
Let me wrap up with a simple variance analysis of our earnings growth starting with revenue. We had exceptional performance in Services with double-digit growth in both Global Technology Services and Global Business Services. Software performance in smaller transactions was solid, but overall growth was impacted by the deferral of a number of large transactions at the end of September.
Systems and Technology declined with weakness in September, particularly in System z transactions and resulted in performance that was frankly below our expectations. Now, overall, revenue growth was 7% and at constant mix and margin this would contribute $0.10 of the $0.23 of year-to-year EPS growth. 
Next, let's look at margin and expense performance. While gross margin declined primarily due to mix, it was more than offset by an improvement in our expense-to-revenue ratio. We took appropriate action to manage our expense this quarter, and to address efficiency of our sales force and our support functions while continuing to invest in our growth initiatives. And while we had additional interest expense related to our Accelerated Share Repurchase, for an impact of $0.07 per share, this was more than offset by the share repurchases bolstered by the ASR which contributed $0.14 to growth for the quarter.
Finally, our tax rate was down 200 basis points for a $0.04 impact.
So to net it out, even in an uncertain economic environment, by leveraging the strength and breadth of the business model we delivered very strong earnings per share growth of 16%. With our year-to-date performance, and assuming a stable economic environment, we believe the current average of analysts' earnings per share estimates for the fourth quarter is reasonable at 15% growth, and results in a full year that is consistent with our full-year objectives.
Now, before going to the Q&A, I want to give you a sense of why we feel confident in our business in this type of environment. We have substantial global reach and presence. We operate in 170 countries, and more than 60% of our revenue is outside the U.S. Asia Pacific remains our fastest-growing geography, and Europe performance has been steady. We continue to invest aggressively in emerging countries to capture the growth in these markets and tap into their skill base to deliver global solutions.
We have a broad mix of businesses. Our hardware, software and services businesses provide a strong and balanced base of operations. We have strong annuity businesses. These businesses, like Strategic Outsourcing, and Software, and Maintenance, represent about half of IBM's revenue. These provide stable sources of profit and more importantly, cash.
We currently have momentum in these businesses with strong Services backlog, improving Services profitability and leading Software capability. These annuity businesses provide a tremendous advantage.
We've got a very solid balance sheet. We have substantial financial flexibility. As an example, look at this quarter. We were able to reduce our debt-to-cap from 47% to 40%, and we still ended the quarter with $13.8 billion of cash on hand.
Finally, we take a very disciplined approach to cost and expense management as we continue to invest in key growth opportunities.
Now, this business model is designed to drive sustainable profit and cash performance over the long term. So let me put our 2007 performance in the context of our 2010 roadmap. For the first three quarters of the year, we have delivered 7% revenue growth, grew net income 9% and expanded margin. Earnings per share grew 16%, and free cash flow was up over 30%. It's a great start towards our 2010 objective.
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy 
Thanks, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A let me comment on two items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark’s prepared remarks.
Also, as always, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions to allow us to take questions from more callers.
Operator, please open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Richard Gardner - Citigroup.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
First on the software deferrals that you mentioned, I was hoping you could give a little bit more detail in terms of what types of product lines were affected and in what vertical markets? What gives you confidence that these deals will close in the December quarter? You did mention that you expect a significant improvement in performance in the December quarter. How can we be confident that this is simply a deferral and not something that is deferred for a longer period of time or lost entirely? Thank you.
Mark Loughridge
First of all, as we exited the quarter, we had a number of large deals that we said that we were right at the goal line on, and they did roll over into the next quarter and we do expect those to close. I do want to add though, that it is interesting in the software base, if you look at by size of deal and deal size category. If you look at deal sizes of $500,000 and below or $500,000 to $1 million, actually those had very sustained momentum through the third quarter. They are very similar to what we saw in the first quarter. It was really a large deal issue.
As we look at those large deals going through the fourth quarter, we know that more deals will be event-driven in the fourth quarter ; in other words, renewal-based actions. We have a lot more confidence in the content and the software base of business as we go through it, looking at the pipeline, looking at the quality of those deals, looking at the metrics associated with logical renewal content. As I look at that balance and with exchange rates where they are, I would think it would be very logical for software to record double-digit revenue at actual rate, and I think we ought to be in a pretty strong double-digit PTI growth as well. So I think we have a very good book of business.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
 Mark, you alluded a couple times to this type of environment and this uncertain economic environment. There were several indicators that suggested that spending may have weakened over the quarter. Your short-term signings were down year over year for the first time in several quarters. You had strong deferrals in software and in hardware at the end of the quarter. 
So the question is, are we seeing a weaker economic environment actually start to affect technology spending? Are the signs that we saw in the quarter not consistent with that?
 Mark Loughridge
A very fair question. If you break down the performance in the third quarter, I think from an economic standpoint to your question, the difference that we saw in the third quarter was really in the financial services sector, and within the financial services sector it was predominantly in the U.S.
Now to put this in a context, financial services sector in the first six months of the year has contributed about 1 point of growth to IBM's growth. If you look at that on a constant currency basis in the first half, IBM did about 5%. If you look at financial services sector contribution in the third quarter, it hurt us for about 1 point of growth. So in other words, outside of financial services sector we are fairly constant, 4% over that period. So I would not look at this and say this was a general economic decline.
Now, within financial services sector I would go more towards the U.S. In fact, if you look at it, the U.S. was the major geography affected from a brand standpoint. zSeries was the major brand affected. I think that's logical, zSeries has about 50% of their business in FSS, so I don't think that is a surprise, given the sector dynamics. But if you exclude those and outside of those particular areas, we had fairly traditional performance for the balance of the FSS business. In fact, it was about 8%. So I don't think this is a general economic issue. 
I do think we did have an FSS slowdown, if you looked at the monthly rate. The first month of the quarter we had growth of 9%, and then it declined from there in the U.S. So I do think we did see an FSS phenomenon, it was mostly localized to the U.S. It was not a general economic environment. I think the broader story here is even in the face of a very important sector at IBM, we still achieved the objectives we were looking for, with strong growth and strong EPS growth of 16%. 
I would also, just to calibrate the U.S. financial services sector framework, the U.S. runs about 30% of global FSS and FSS is about 28% of IBM. So we're talking about something about 7% to 8% of the IBM base of business.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
 Outside of financial services, can you comment on the linearity in the quarter?
 Mark Loughridge
As we looked outside of the financial services sector and looked across the three quarters and the progression, there wasn't something in those other sectors that had a similar kind of a profile at all to FSS. This is mostly contained to FSS, the FSS mostly contained within the U.S. We did also have, if you looked at the product line most affected, it was zSeries, and we've gone through eight quarters of pretty strong growth there so we're now working on migration offerings for the fourth quarter. I'm sure that played a part as well. But you did not see this kind of portrayal in the other sectors that we saw in FSS, predominantly U.S.

Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes - UBS.
 Ben Reitzes - UBS
Good afternoon. Could you just talk a little bit more about hardware and the visibility, why that could get better, to go to flat and then grow? We have to navigate through a $250 million hit from the printers being gone, we know. Could you just elaborate? I think that segment was about $500 million below people's estimates and particularly the pSeries, going through the product transition, the xSeries, and what we should expect for the fourth quarter in terms of push outs and the new products?
 Mark Loughridge
 Let me first calibrate the overall hardware in the fourth quarter. I portrayed that in the script, and just to explain that, we said more stable performance, and I think it would be relatively flat on a year-to-year basis on revenue and profitability. Now within that, as we move from the third quarter, obviously hardware did not meet our expectations in the third quarter. But as you go from third to fourth in zSeries, we're now going to be working on the migration offerings to assist our customer base to move to new technology content. I think that will make a difference as we go into the fourth quarter performance. We also had some large rollover deals that I think will also close as well. So, that would be zSeries.
When you look at pSeries, I think pSeries had a pretty good quarter. At this growth rate, it picked up 2 points of growth. As you know, we have POWER6 now in the midrange in pSeries, and that midrange pSeries with POWER6 grew 26% in the quarter. So that was pretty strong performance from that new technology base.
If you look at xSeries, xSeries as we go into the fourth quarter is now going to have the quad-core technology, which I think will be a very good technology for us. On a blades basis, we're going to have the BladeCenter s. BladeCenter s is specifically for SMB, and it's really, when you think about it, it's like a data center in a box, ready to set up for your SMB marketplace. We will also have our core blade offering as well, which is a pretty impressive offering.
So I think we have a number of technologies out there, and technologies that will drive improved performance as we go into the fourth quarter, but I'm not drawing a point about the third. We were disappointed in the third, and I know we can do better in that base of business as we go into the fourth.

Your next question comes from Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs.
 Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs
First of all, given what's going on with bond yields, the recent moves in bond yields, can you update or give us an update on your confidence that you still think you will see the $800 million benefit in '08 that you have talked about before? 
Continuing on the same line, i.e. confidence levels, last quarter you did indicate that you expected to see your full-year signings growth equal to what it was last year. Are you still thinking the same way?
 Mark Loughridge
 Let me answer your first question. We just did some analysis since we updated the pension portfolio and again, we update this on a global basis for both the short end and the long end of the yield curve, and it still has roughly that same $800 million of benefit as we go into '08. In fact, it was just a little larger than that as we did the analysis.
You know that we don't formally update those rates until we get to the end of the year. So we will have to see where that turns out. But right now, it's a very similar curve and I would expect that we would get about that same benefit as we go into 2008.
As far as full year signings growth, we did 12% in the third quarter. We've got 10% going on a year-to-date. You are quite correct, as you've pointed out, we face a big hill as we look at the compare in the fourth quarter. But as I look at a balanced case, a balanced case, I think we have relatively flat signings for the year, but within that growth in short-term signings.
Now I want to reassure you, when we run our pipeline, when we run our quotas, when we run our measurements, we are all driving for growth for the full year, but I think on a balanced basis, flat signings performance is reasonable, within that short term would be up.
Where does flat signings put us for services? As we exit the quarter, we will still have growth in our backlog on a year-to-year basis. On that basis, we should still, in the first half of 2008, see growth within our services business within the model range of 6% to 8%.
So I couldn't be more impressed with the job that our services units did as they went through the third quarter. You remember as we did the second quarter, I had said with both of them at 10% growth, it was the strongest performance I had ever seen. Imagine now we've got 13% and 16%; so a lot of velocity, a lot of momentum out of those units as well, driving better margins and profitability.

Your next question comes from Bill Shope – JP Morgan.
 Bill Shope - JP Morgan
Great, thanks. Mark, I want to dig in to the zSeries performance a bit more. In past quarters, you have noted that the volatility in the mainframe cycle was being muted somewhat by nontraditional workload growth and some other factors. What has changed with this argument, and are we entering a period of sustained volatility again, or should we look at this as a short-term blip?
 Mark Loughridge
I think the way to characterize this is we're now going into a transition. Again, I want to reiterate that we've gone through eight quarters of sustained growth on this zSeries, because this has been a very successful platform. I would also remind everybody that it's facing a pretty tough compare in third quarter last year. The revenue for zSeries last year was up 23%. That's a big number to compare to.
So I don't think this to me looks like real volatility, and I don't expect there to be more volatility going forward. We are going to be going through the transition with our customers and helping them solve their computing requirements and move to migration offerings to help them move to new technologies.

Your next question comes from Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank.
 Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks very much. I was hoping to get a little more clarity on profitability and margin pressure in the software business, hoping that you can provide more color there. Secondly, can you comment at all about 2008 earnings expectations, assuming the current environment continues through next year? Thanks a lot.
 Mark Loughridge
Yes. I think as I said earlier, as we move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in our software business, we expect to see double-digit profit growth on a year-to-year basis. Remember now, we began to wrap in the fourth quarter on the large acquisitions that we did last year that carried with them a lot of amortization of intangibles. So, as we wrap on that, it helps us balance our cost base with our revenue. So again, in the fourth quarter I expect to see double-digit profitability out of the software base.
As far as 2008 is concerned, we generally comment on 2008 in the January meeting. We do that because a big component is pension and we've got to see where the rates turned out the last day of the month of December and everything. So that's when we generally give guidance. But there's nothing that I have seen so far that would generally change our view of '08. I thought the context that we try to provide to demonstrate that was an update on our 2010 model that we gave at analyst day. 
If you look at the model and you said, well, what kind of a growth rate would you need in EPS to get to your objectives of $10 to $11? I mean, you've got to be in those mid-teens. So on a year-to-date basis, for us to be at 16%, I conclude we're on track to those set of objectives in 2010. We will certainly say more about 2008 when we get to January.

Your next question comes from Lou Miscioscia - Cowen.
 Lou Miscioscia - Cowen
Thank you. Maybe you could spend a minute or two on the disk area, which seemed to be weak. Was it that you're seeing weaker ASPs, competition, virtualization, product transition? Maybe you could you share a little bit more color there.
 Mark Loughridge
If you look underneath the storage business, we continue to have pretty good performance out of our tape business. We didn't do as well on the disk business. If you look behind the disk business, it was really mid-range disk where we had more difficulty. If you looked at the high end, actually the high end did quite well on a volume basis when you look at the growth there. 
So this was confined more to the mid-range disk profile. Tape did well, high-end disk did well, and as we go into the fourth quarter, we expect to see improvement in midrange. But we also expect to see ongoing performance and strength continue in tape and high-end disk.
Operator
Your next question comes from Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns.
 Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns 
 I just wanted to go back and clarify some of your comments on the software side. Were you saying that the deferrals, were they mostly related to the financial sector or were they more broad-based? Can you give us a better sense about what the reasons for those deferrals were and why you are confident those are going to close? Were there technical issues, or can you give us a little more color on that?
 Mark Loughridge
Sure. If you look at the deals that deferred -- and again, I want to explain that even a handful of these deals would have made a pretty substantial difference in software performance in the quarter, but if you look at the deals that did defer, about 70% of those deals were in fact in the financial services sector. Now however, they were pretty far advanced. As we move those deals into the fourth quarter, as I had said earlier, we've got a very good pipeline. We know the progression of those deals and we're pretty confident in them. We also have more event-based metrics and milestones as we enter the fourth quarter. By that, I mean logical renewals that we will see.
So we're pretty confident that we'll see improved revenue performance out of the software business, with currency at actual rates that have come in, I think, a more double-digit revenue growth and as we ramp on the acquisitions from last year, we will see, I believe, double-digit profit growth as well.
Operator
Your next question comes from Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley.
 Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Mark, what were the buckets of SG&A spend that you were able to pull back on in order to meet the EPS targets this quarter? How sustainable is that level of spend?
 Mark Loughridge
When you look at SG&A, we have been doing a very concerted effort for some time now to drive globalization of our structural spending and move spending to grow areas, move spending to emerging geographies. As you say, what do I mean by structural SG&A? I mean like finance. I mean the other staff functions on a global basis. What is a good metric? Well, imagine this: 40% of my finance organization is going to be in these globalized centers of excellence by the end of '08. That is a very concrete set of actions that we're moving. 
We are also being, I think appropriately, tough on spending in areas where we do not see the same opportunity for growth. But with all of those, we're moving that expense into areas that we see bigger opportunities for sustained, ongoing growth like emerging markets.

Your final question comes from David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners.
 David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners
Thank you. Mark, could you just expand a little bit more on the decline in GBS bookings, particularly in the face of such strong current-quarter revenue performance, and perhaps talk a little bit of how we should think about margin expansion going forward in IGS, given again, such strong performance in the third quarter?
 Mark Loughridge
First of all, as I looked at the GBS bookings on a trailing basis, short-term signings were up 7%. On a year-to-date basis, they were up 4%. As we look out for the year and close out the full year, we see short-term signings coming back in the fourth, and it's closing on a full-year basis at approximately that same range of growth. 
So I think the short-term impact we saw in short-term signings in GBS was just that, a short-term impact. I think it should come back as we go into the fourth quarter.
As far as margins are concerned, you remember that as we went through the analyst review, we were talking about our view that margins across services could grow 2 points by 2010, and here we're sitting here with both sides of this equation generating growth of 1.2 points and 1.3 points on a net margin basis. That's pretty strong performance.
Especially, remember GTS, they had a lot of work to do. So it's not only an acknowledgment that both organizations are really focusing on the bottom line profitability of their businesses, but GTS really showed strong improvement with the actions that they took in the second quarter. As you remember, we did the math in the second quarter and explained that that ought to be able to hit 10%. Sure enough, what did they come in at? They came in at 10.8%. So I'm quite encouraged by this performance. Both of our services group showed a real, real momentum here, and I couldn't be more appreciative of such a great job they did.
Let me just take a moment now and summarize the third quarter performance and give you a consolidated view of the fourth. First of all, per the last question, I will start out with services. GTS and GBS have just shown tremendous momentum, with revenue up 13% and 16%, profit up a substantial 26% and 29%. I mean really, when is the last time we had profitability in both sides of the services business off such a strong double-digit base? These key businesses delivered PTI margins of 10.8% and 10.7%; very balanced, with year-to-year improvement of 1.2 and 1.3 points year to year.
These are like very large cruisers; once you get that momentum going, you're not going to change that much as you go forward. So we expect to see continued momentum for both GBS and GTS as we go into the fourth quarter. As you all know, that makes up more than half of our revenue.
Our hardware business, as we said earlier, did not meet our objectives in the third as we wrestled with product transitions and tough compares in z. We expect to see typical quarter-to-quarter growth from the third to the fourth quarter, with relatively flat year-to-year performance excluding printers in the fourth quarter; then returning to growth in first quarter of '08. So more work to do on the hardware side of the business.
Our software business grew 7% in the third quarter. However, we could have done much better in large deal closure at the end of the quarter, and we intend to as we go into the fourth. For the fourth quarter for software, we expect double-digit revenue growth at current exchange rates and double-digit profit growth, with the strongest margins among our businesses, even against difficult compares. 
So I think all of this should put us in good shape to meet our objectives for the fourth quarter.
Now, I would also ask you to step back and say, let's look beyond the fourth. First of all, our financial base is rock solid. We have almost $14 billion of cash; our non-financing debt to cap came down quarter to quarter from 47% to 40%. We accessed the capital market at 30 points below LIBOR for 30-day commercial paper, and the largest bond offering in IBM's history was oversubscribed by a multiple of two.
I think the strongest strength we see is the diversification of this business. We are a global business, with 60% of our business outside the U.S. We are well positioned in high growth markets. Our year-to-date EPS performance was up 16%, and we're on track to meeting our 2010 objectives.
So I thank you for joining our call today; and now, it's back to the fourth quarter.

Mark Loughridge
Thanks Patricia, and thanks for joining us today. Before going into the financials, let me give you an overview of the quarter. This was a really strong quarter, close to firing on all cylinders. We saw improving revenue growth, gross margin expansion and successful execution of our ASR or Accelerated Share Repurchase. 
From a geographic perspective, we had broad base success. Our performance was led by Asia, were we had solid execution, capitalizing on an improving economy and leveraging the investments we have made in the emerging markets. Europe was up 13%, while half of this was currency the other half was solid business performance. But really Americas had the best improvement led by the U.S. Last quarter we told you, we expected an improvement in the U.S. and this quarter we got it. Revenue was up 6%. 
From the business unit perspective, software revenue growth was 13% and both services were up 10%. Systems delivered on their model, though overall Systems and Technology growth was impacted by weakness in microelectronics and the sale of our printer business. Our EPS grew 19%, 15% excluding the gain from the printer sale. All of this contributed to strong cash flow. In fact free cash flow was up $1.7 billion year-to-year. 
So now let's turn to the financial summary. As you can see revenue was $23.8 billion, an increase of 9% as reported and 6% of constant currency. This is the best constant currency revenue growth we've had in over 6 years. We expanded gross profit margins to 41.8%. It was the 12th consecutive quarter of year-to-year improvement. 
Expense was up 11% driven by investments and sales resource and acquisitions and our mix to higher value businesses. Excluding the $81 million gain from the printer sale expense was up 12%. 
Our net income was up 12% or 8% without the printer gain. We executed the $12.5 billion ASR and in total bought back 9% of our shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter. We raised our dividend by 33% and net dividend has now doubled in the last two years. Bottom-line, we delivered $1.55 of EPS, growth of 19% year-to-year, excluding the printer gain earnings per share was $1.50 growth of 15% year-to-year. 
Now when I step back, these results demonstrate our intense focus on profit growth and cash generation, while continuing to invest for the future. As we get into the details, you’ll see we’ve made good progress against our 2010 roadmap discussed at our May investor meeting. 
So let’s start the discussion with our geographic revenue. 
All three geographies improved their growth rate from the first quarter. 
Americas’ revenue grew 5% at constant currency. We told you we expected improvement in the U.S. in the second quarter. And while economic data suggests the US economy improved in the second quarter, I think more importantly, the team really executed, and the results show it. The US growth improved to 6 percent. 
Once again we had very powerful results outside the US as well. 
Europe continued to improve, up 13% as reported and 6% at constant currency. Most major countries performed well, including Spain, the UK, and Italy. They were all up. Germany also grew with solid results for the second consecutive quarter, benefiting from an improving economy and better sales execution. 
Asia Pacific again had the best performance with 10% growth. The Asia Pacific economy remained very strong, led by India, ASEAN, and a steady recovery in Japan. We had solid contribution from all regions. In fact three regions posted growth of 21%, 19%, and 16%, and Japan grew for the third consecutive quarter at constant currency. 
Our strategies to focus on higher growth emerging countries are paying off. In fact, our emerging countries are Brazil, Russia, India and China grew 25 percent at constant currency. These countries now are 5% of IBM's revenue and contributed one point of growth to the IBM total. 
Both China and India are up over 30% and we believe we gained share in those countries. Brazil grew 9% and Russia was up a very powerful 52%. 
These emerging countries are among the fastest growing IT markets in world and we're investing to capture this growth. Over the next four years, as we covered in our May analyst meeting, our objective is to double the revenue growth for these countries, and our performance in the first half is a great start towards this goal. 
Now let's turn to the segment results. 
We are going to get into the specifics on revenue in the segment discussions. But let me focus here on gross margin. IBM's gross margin improved six-tenths of a point year-to-year. As I look at it, approximately two-thirds of our improvement is operational efficiencies, the remaining one-third is mix shift to higher margin businesses. 
By business unit, three units showed good improvement. Global Business Services continued the positive trend, with the improvement driven by better utilization, strong contract management, and improving pricing trends. And these each contributed about a third of that improvement. 
Our Software margin expansion was driven by strong revenue growth with a fixed cost structure. 
And Systems and Technology margin improved in each of our server brands as customers consolidate and virtualize workloads on the high-end. 
Global Technology Services was flat again, but up sequentially. We have taken action to improve our cost profile in the US. 
Global Financing declined, and this was a function of narrowing financing spreads and increased interest costs. 
So let's now move on to Expense. 
Total expense and other income increased 11%, consistent with the trend we saw in the last few quarters. Without the $81 million printer gain, expense was up 12%. 
I think one way to look at this increase in expense is that to some degree it's a reflection of the changing mix of our business. Higher value businesses contribute to higher gross margin, but they also require higher operating expense. 
If we peel back the 12% growth in the second quarter, approximately three points of growth was due to currency and we estimate that about five points of the growth is from our acquisitions. 
Of the five remaining points, one point is driven by increase in our interest expense to fund our Accelerated Share Repurchase. And the remaining four points is from investments in our software and services business, and our emerging markets. 
The returns on these investments are really reflected in the momentum in our key middleware brands, and growth in emerging markets, and our improving services signings. 
I would like to highlight a couple of other items that significantly impacted our profit growth. First of all, IP income was up $58 million year-to-year, coming off of a very low base in the second quarter of 2006. Secondly, over a $150 million of workforce rebalancing was incurred in the quarter and that was up $58 million. Half of this was used to address the cost issues in Global Technology Services, which as you remember, was predominantly in Strategic Outsourcing. 
Looking forward, we expect to reduce this rate of expense growth in the second half. In fact, even with the $270 million of additional interest expense from increased debt to fund our Accelerated Share Repurchase, we expect total expense growth rate in the second half to be in the range of 7% to 9%, before the impact of any future acquisitions. This improvement will be skewed more to the fourth quarter and I have got to add, of course, we are always on the hunt for good acquisitions, but I think this gives you a better sense of our operating trends. 
Now let’s talk about cash flow. 
As you can see, we had outstanding cash flow performance. In the quarter, free cash flow was $2.7 billion, up $1.7 billion year-to-year, and $2.9 billion quarter-to-quarter. 
Last quarter we explained that we had some weakness in our accounts receivable performance to put in place the action plan to deliver improvements. As you can see, we executed very well in the second quarter with strong accounts receivable performance across all geographies. In fact, our DSO improved one day year-to-year and a very strong four days on a quarter-to-quarter basis. 
For the first half, free cash flow was $2.5 billion, a $1.8 billion increase from last year. Year-to-date cash performance was driven by growth in net income and strong working capital performance. Our cash generation was strong in all geographies. 
So let me cover some events that impacted the year-to-year compare. First, major funding actions for our time end related plans were $800 million less this year, and second this quarter nearly $400 million of proceeds from the printer sale went to cash from ops. Strong and recurring cash flow enabled us to drive shareholder value to higher dividends and record share repurchases. Along with this, we maintained investments required for our long-term growth. 
In the first half, we returned an unprecedented $19.2 billion to investors through our share repurchase and dividends. We bought back 176 million shares at $18 billion. Average diluted shares were $1.5 billion down 5.2% from a year ago. We executed a $12.5 billion Accelerated Share Repurchase. It was by far the largest ASR ever executed. We funded the ASR through debt and cash. We still have $1.8 billion remaining from our Board authorization. With the execution of the ASR, we achieved first, an immediate share reduction, second, lower cost of capital and third, good use of non-US cash. 
In the half, we also paid out over a $1 billion in dividends and announced a $0.10 per share increase or 33% increase in our quarterly dividends. With this, we have now doubled our dividend over the last two years. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet where we see the change to our capital structure. Cash on hand is $10.2 billion. As we have executed our strategy, business has gotten stronger and our ability to maintain a more leveraged capital structure has increased. We funded the ASR with a $11.5 billion of short-term debt taking our non-financing debt up to a $11.8. With this, our debt-to-capital was 47%. 
Over the next few years we expect our leverage ratio to be in the range of 20% to 30% debt-to-cap. The remaining two-thirds of the $34.7 billion of debt as to support our global financing business, but I think has leveraged at an appropriate 7:1. This leverage is relatively unaffected by the capital structure changes. 
The balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to support the business over the long-term. So, now let's turn to the businesses starting with services. 
Global Services delivered strong performance in the quarter, $13.1 billion of revenue, up 10% as reported and 7% at constant currency. It's the strongest revenue performance in over three years at constant currency. We had signings of $11.7 billion, up 22% year-to-year with 11 deals larger than a $100 million and a backlog of a $116 billion, up a billion quarter-to-quarter and up $7 billion year-to-year. 
Looking at our recent signings performance, short-terms signings have been up four consecutive quarters, long-term signings are up for the year and are up 23% on a trailing 12 month’s basis. 
Looking at Global Business Services, our transformational actions to improve the business are paying off. We've increased competitiveness of our offerings, expanded capabilities in SOA and are leveraging global delivery capabilities across our portfolio. These contributed to continued signings growth, increased revenue growth and strong margin expansion. Revenue was up 10% as reported and up 8% at constant currency. 
Balance across all three geographies with the strongest growth coming from Asia-Pacific it was also balanced across the business. With application management services, and corporate consulting contributing to this improved performance. Our pre-tax margin was 10.4%, an improvement of 9/10s of a point year-to-year, and pre-tax profit was up nearly 20%. This profit expansion is driven by revenue growth and improved utilization, stable to improving pricing trends and strong contract management. So, a very strong performance by our global businesses team. 
Now let's look at Global Technology Services. Total revenue was up 10% and 7% at constant currency. We had the best performance in some time, balanced and strong across all geographies. 
Our Strategic Outsourcing business showed revenue growth of 8%, and signings growth of 22%. This is driven by good signings performance over the last 12 months, continued lower erosion, and selling new business into our existing account. It really demonstrates that the best customer is the one you've already got, and we have a lot of very valuable customers. In fact the focus on customers and service delivery was key to the growth in our base accounts this quarter. Customer signed up for new scope and short-term projects and this growth helped to mitigate some of the dependency on new customer signings. 
Asia was our strongest contributor to revenue, up double-digits. Our ASEAN and South Asia region was up over 50%, led by India. In fact strategic outsourcing in India grew nearly 150%. 
Now let me step back for a minute to discuss total IBM services in India, including both GTS and GBS. Domestic Services revenue was up 50% or more for seven of our past eight quarters. We are helping customers build out their infrastructures and position their business for rapid growth. 
In fact, we’re beating the local competition on their own turf. I’ve talked to you in the past about our key services deal with Bharti Telecom, and earlier this year we signed another large telco deal with Idea Cellular. This quarter, the momentum continued as we signed agreements with the Delhi Airport, the Indian Tax Authority, and additional scope with Idea Cellular. In fact a recent IDC study ranks IBM Global Services as the largest domestic IT services provider in India. 
Our Business Transformation Outsourcing business was up 15% as reported, with signings up nearly 70% year-to-year. 
Our Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 15%, and signings here were up 8% year-to-year. We saw sustained signings growth and continued improvement and progress from the changes we’ve implemented over the last year. 
Our IT Security Solutions, as an example, was quite strong. Internet Security Systems contributes to our capabilities, and we had several wins for our newly announced high-end appliance, which blocks security threats from entering a client's environment. A good example of a win here is Comerica Bank. 
Our global surveillance services grew significantly, with key wins in the public sector. At Chicago Transit Authority, we are implementing a new surveillance and analytics infrastructure to improve response and remediation for local public safety. 
And at one of the largest banks in the world, Unicredito, we’re rolling out surveillance infrastructure for fraud detection and response to criminal activity, initially in 60 branches. 
Our GTS pre-tax margin was 8.6%, down eight-tenths of a point year-to-year, but up eight-tenth of a point sequentially. Last quarter we told you about the actions we’re taking to address our cost base, primarily in the U.S. In the second quarter we incurred about $90 million in restructuring charges that impacted pre-tax margin growth by about six-tenth of a point. Excluding restructuring, pre-tax margin was closer to flat on a year-to-year basis. 
To wrap up Services, we had good signings and profit growth, and with revenue growth up 10%, 7% at constant currency, we had the strongest performance in years. 
Systems and Technology revenue of $5.1 billion grew 2% year-to-year, or flat at constant currency. But profit grew 77% with 2.6 points of improvement in our margin. 
In June we completed the sale of the printer business. This impacted the Systems and Technology revenue growth by about 2 points in the quarter. Going forward, this results in a loss of approximately $250 million of revenue per quarter. 
Our systems business grew 7%, or 4% at constant currency. This is right in line with the long-term model that we showed you at the analyst meeting in May. Though the total business was affected by the technology business which did decline, due to soft demand for game consoles. 
Now turning to the brands, let’s talk about System z. System z revenue grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, with another quarter of double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and strong growth in Europe. MIPS grew 45% with strength in both traditional and specialty workloads. In fact we had the eighth consecutive quarter of MIPS growth, longer than any product cycle since the mid-90s. MIPS for traditional workloads grew over 20%. Customers leverage this platform’s superior economics, including reduced power and cooling requirements. But if you look at the MIPS on specialty engines they grew over 130%, reflecting the mainframe's ability to virtualize and consolidate different workloads. Linux MIPS grew over 80%, Java and Database MIPS each grew over 100%. 
Year-to-year gross profit margin improvement was driven primarily by higher margin capacity-on-demand upgrades. 
System i declined but we'll be bringing POWER6 technology to this platform later this quarter. 
System p grew 7% and gained share. System p began to transition to our next generation of POWER technology and you saw the introduction of our POWER6 to the midrange. 
System x server revenue grew 16%. We had growth across the portfolio especially in four-way and eight-way servers. Workload virtualization and consolidation is driving demand for our high-end system x. In System x Blades we saw growth of 15%. 
System Storage growth was driven by very strong performance in tape while external disk was flat. Tape rose 19% with double-digit growth in Enterprise and Midrange. 
Microelectronics revenue was down. Overall, demand for our game consoles was simply not as strong as anticipated. We do have opportunities in other high growth segments, including wired and wireless communications. But just to put this in perspective, this business accounts for only 1% of our gross profit. 
Our Retail Store Solutions grew as large retailer clients continued to roll-out new point of sale solutions. We are the worldwide industry leader in programmable point-of-sale devices. 
Turning to Systems and Technology profit, we had good profit and margin performance. As discussed at our May analyst meeting, customers are consolidating and virtualizing their workloads. This is driving demand for profitable high-end products, which contributed to a 2.6 point improvement in our profit margin. 
Our Software business had another very strong quarter. Software segment revenue of $4.8 billion was up 13% year-to-year as reported, and 9% at constant currency. Our key branded middleware was particularly strong, growing approximately twice the market growth rate, and continuing to take share. In fact over half of our branded middleware growth was organic. 
Looking at the brands, WebSphere grew 28%. SOA-related products are in strong demand as evidenced by the double-digit growth we saw in WebSphere Business Integration, Application Servers and Portals. We expect that we outpaced our major competition which includes Oracle, BEA, Microsoft and Tibco. 
Information Management software is increasingly important in today's digital world. This quarter we grew 21%. Within that, our Information on Demand portfolio grew 17%. Also within Information Management, our FileNet acquisition continues to perform well. And we enjoyed four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in Distributed Relational Database. We believe we gained share in both Information Management and the Distributed Relational Database markets, as well as versus our top competitor. 
The Tivoli software portfolio includes products which help customers manage complex networks and data centers. The growth was outstanding, fueled primarily by organic performance in our Security, Storage and Systems Management products, while MRO, Vallent and Consul acquisitions bolstered this impressive performance. In total, Tivoli revenue grew 33%, gaining share in all key segments and outpacing our top competitors. 
Our Lotus software is well-established as a tool for providing improved workplace collaboration and productivity. We've had eleven consecutive quarters of growth here, and in June we delivered Lotus Connections, a social networking platform for business. 
Rational software provides tools necessary today to build advanced applications and systems software. We are investing heavily in Rational with recently refreshed product lines and strategic acquisitions. In the second quarter we announced our intent to acquire both Watchfire and Telelogic, and we will expand in our reach into new markets and new customers. We continued our strong growth and we believe we gained share again this quarter, growing significantly faster than the market. 
The Operating System and Other Middleware segments of the portfolio include a variety of more mature software products. This provides a strong source of both profit and cash. For total Software, the margins were down as we integrated acquisitions. Total profit for the segment grew 8% to $1.2 billion. 
Now, I want to step back and comment on our success in software over the last few years. Our key branded middleware is now 53% of total software revenue, up 5 points from a year ago and up 10 points since 2004. As this faster growing branded middleware becomes a larger portion of the portfolio, it’s having a greater impact on our total software growth. 
This software portfolio, you’ve got to remember, this is the result of more than 30 years of investment. We didn’t just ramp this up yesterday. It provides much of the foundation for our business infrastructure, and this software is found in virtually all aspects of the middleware marketplace, from the common relational database, to transaction processing on the web, to new social networking capabilities for business. 
In recent years, our investment in this portfolio has increased and operational execution has improved. Software is now our largest provider of IBM profit and our most stable source of growth. 
So to wrap up, let’s discuss the key contributors to our earnings growth. Let’s starts with revenue. 
We had the best revenue performance in years. We saw 9% growth, and a constant mix in margin, this contributed $0.11 to our EPS growth. We expanded our gross margin led by software with good year-to-year performance in Global Business Services and Systems & Technology. 
We did have growth in expense, primarily driven by investments in sales and service capabilities and our acquisitions. As I said earlier, we expect this expense growth to moderate in the second half. 
We had two additional items that did impact our growth this quarter. First of all, we funded a higher level of restructuring activity to address our strategic outsourcing business in the U.S., and secondly, we have additional interest expense associated with the debt to support our Accelerated Share Repurchase program. Those share repurchases, bolstered by the ASR, contributed $0.10 to growth for overall quarter. 
We had a lower tax rate that also contributed. But overall, we had 15% earnings per share growth in the quarter, or 19% including the gain from the printer sale. 
Turning to the full year, previously we had indicated earnings per share growth of 13% to 14% for the year. With these second quarter results, we now expect earnings per share growth for 2007 to be in the range of 14% to 15%. 
No two ways about it, this was a great quarter. But our business model success will be measured over the long term, not at any individual quarter or year. The strategies we put in place, the investments we make, and the actions we take are all with an objective of optimizing our long-term performance. 
So now let’s turn to the last page and discuss our road map to 2010. 
At our May investor meeting, we talked about strategic decisions, like investing in businesses that contribute high profitability and cash flows to allow us to generate strong earnings and higher shareholder returns. We also talked about long-term goals, and specific initiatives. 
After the first half, let’s take a snapshot on how we are doing against our 2010 roadmap. 
First, revenue. This clearly accelerated with strength in software and services. This is supported by progress in our growth initiatives such as emerging countries and SOA, and we are continuing to execute our acquisition strategy. 
On margin expansion, we’ve expanded our gross margins, led by improving business mix and productivity initiatives, though we had less net margin expansion, as we are investing to drive future growth. 
On share repurchase, we are off to a great start. This year, we spent over $18 billion, including $12.5 billion on our Accelerated Share Repurchase. All of this contributed to 16% earnings per share growth in the first half. So we’ve made our first installment toward our $11 a share goal for 2010, and overall, we feel good about our first half, and how it positions us to deliver on our long-term objectives. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, let me comment on two items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark’s prepared remarks. 
 Also, as always, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions to allow us to take questions from more callers. Operator, please open it up for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instruction) And our first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi, Sanford Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Yes, thank you. Mark, I have one question and that is about operating expense. You've had very good gross margin expansion over the last couple of years. In the last three quarters your OpEx expansion has been bigger than your margin expansion and your pre-tax income margins are actually down year-over-year. I know you gave some guidance around, where you expect OpEx growth to be in the back half of the year, but do you think that pre-tax income margin should actually start to increase on a year-over-year basis in the second half of the year? 
Mark Loughridge
Well thanks, Toni. Let me break that into the components of that expense performance in the second quarter and now help us lead into the second half. First of all, if you look at the components, number one, we had about three points of that expense growth was driven by overall currency impact. 
Then we had about another four to five points from the acquisition impact and then five points that I would attribute to the operational performance in the business. Of those five points, about one point of that was driven by the additional interest expense that we had to fund the ASR. Now two components of that, first of all the acquisition expense and the investment to drive our business start to wrap, as we go into the second half. 
On the acquisition front, we start to wrap on those very big acquisitions that we did in the second half of last year. We would still continue our acquisition pace, but we do begin to wrap on those very big acquisitions. And secondly, to invest in the growth in our business last year, we kind of kick-started the resource build up in the second half of last year, and so, as we now move through in the second half that starts to wrap on itself as well. 
As far as how that now would translate into a margin impact, I would kind of take that to a net margin basis, so let's do it on net margin with the advantage of the lower tax rate that we had in the second quarter, with that net margin was about flat on a year-to-year basis. If we pulled out this additional restructuring that we had told you about, and we also pulled out the additional interest for the ASR. In fact our net margins would have been up about four-tenths of a point and that four-tenths of a point is right on the model. So, the model objective is still to achieve that four-tenths. We are going to take the right actions as these expense build up start to roll into the second half. And I am looking for net margin expansion over the long-term. I think, we got to start to see that in the second half. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tony. Let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Whitmore, Deutsche Bank 
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks, good afternoon. Hoping to get more color on the improvement you saw in North America. Was some of the strengths the catch up from Q1, and better sales execution, are you seeing a recovery in U.S. IT spending? Thanks 
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Well, first of all, I want to start off and answer that question with congratulations to our team in the Americas. I mean, they did a great job. I think the best part about this frankly, is that at the end of the year first quarter, we have said that, we had the right plan, we had the right book of business and we had the right deals to improve our performance in Americas. And boy did they carry that through with strong growth in the Americas underneath that U.S. up 6%. 
When you look at that U.S. performance, there is a couple of ingredients. First of all, I do think, we saw a relatively improving economy. Now it’s not back to the economy that we saw back in '06, but we didn’t see that tail-off that we saw in the third month of the first quarter continue into the second quarter. So, I do think we had a better economy, but I think there is a lot more than that, that we can attribute to the Americas team. 
First of all, as I had said earlier when we built up this resource in second half, you have got to train that resource, you have got to equip that resource, you got to assign them to the right account structure, so it could take some time for that to be productive resource. And I think we began to see that resource kicking in as we went trough the second quarter. Secondly we are now enjoying some of the fruits at its higher level of signings that we have had in our services business. That fourth quarter was very powerful, that's beginning to show through. 
And the third, I don’t want to miss this point in the service business especially we are beginning to see more and more business and revenue growth out of our existing account base, our existing customer set. And we get that growth out of our existing customer sets, it exhibits itself more rapidly in current period revenue. 
So, I would look at those attributes and number one this is not a function of roll over deals from the first quarter, this is real execution. And I think those attributes and the momentum that that team has been able to build should carry into the second half. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Chris, lets go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you, and our next question comes from Laura Conigliaro, Goldman Sachs. 
Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs
Yes, thank you. Over you signings, excuse year-to-date are now up 8.8%. You have to average about a little over 13 billion for each of the next couple of quarters just to end up flat for the year. A number of measures of the market continue to remind us that the number of large deals is shrinking. Its ending up flat even reasonable for the year and if you do, what is that actually suggestive like your services growth rate for the next 12 to 18 months, given that that revenue from short-term signings isn’t even half of our your quarterly revenue. 
Mark Loughridge
Sure, I think that's a great question. Lets look at signings first as we move from the second quarter into the third quarter, you saw second quarter signings 22%, good signings base as we move into the third, we have got a good deal list as we go into the third quarter. So, as I look at it and as I work with the GBS and the GTS teams on this, we collectively feel pretty confident that we should see reasonable signings growth, as we go into the third quarter. 
Now you are quite correct we have a very big hurdle to overcome in the fourth quarter. So we need to build up some additional momentum. But as we are laying out our plans, our objective is for full-year signing growth. It is a challenge we have to build up some additional momentum in this third quarter, but our objective is full-year signings growth. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Laura. Let's go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes UBS. 
Ben Reitzes - UBS Securities
Could you talk a little bit more about hardware. In particular, you are going to a product transition. So, what is your confidence in potential revenue acceleration as you move throughout the year, given hardware is really the least recurring of all your businesses? And what's your confidence in the new product cycle there, not only in the servers, in the pSeries, but also in storage, it looks like disk was obviously pretty weak in the quarter, if you can comment on servers and storage with regard to the new products in the year end, that would be helpful? Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge
Sure, I will be glad to. Thanks Ben. As I look at the hardware performance in the second quarter; if you go down to that line that I withdraw at systems, systems did grow 4% at constant currency. So, at 4% at constant currency, systems on the model that we reviewed with you at Analyst Day, remember the revenue growth we are looking for over the longer term from our systems business, system technology was 4% to 5%. So they did lineup with the model. 
With that systems growth and the attention that they paid both in margin expansion and expense management, they did grow profitability by a pretty impressive 77% now top a low base last year, but a pretty strong profitability growth. A lot of that margin improvement I think is also a reflection of the same attributes we discussed at the Analyst Meeting, virtualization and mixing the higher-end servers, because virtualization gives our customer a very strong economic reason to buy into the high end. So, I think we are seeing that. 
So, as I look at the systems business, I would check-off as a make, the systems performance to the model on both margin expansion, exploiting the advantage of virtualization to a higher-end products and meeting the revenue objective of 4%. And we would have the same expectation for that business as we go into the second half. As far as storage is concerned, we had tremendous performance that of our tape business was up 19%. As you point out, this was relatively flat. We were not satisfied with that. So, we are looking for improvement in the overall disk performance as we go into the second half. 
The other question you asked is what impact did we have from new technology, a POWER6 and the implementation of product line, I think it did have some impact in our pSeries product line, remember that we implemented that in June in the second quarter to the midrange. But I don't think it was a lot of impact. We'll see that begin to normalize as we go into the third quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Okay, thanks Ben. Let's go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Gardner, Citigroup. 
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
Okay, thank you. Mark, you spent a lot of time at the Analyst Meeting talking about post-retirement expense for 2008. And I was wondering if you could just update us on your thoughts on the recent move that we've seen in corporate bond yield, and what the sensitivity is there on 2008 post-retirement expense? Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge
Well, Richard do you remember, when we went through the discussion at the analyst meeting we were quite precise in rolling out what we thought that improvement would be, and in fact in 2008 what we said is, we saw an $800 million improvement on a year-to-year base from overall retirement our plans going into next year. Since that time, I mean, frankly returns and interest rates have relatively gone in our favor. 
But I wouldn’t update that model right now, because it's rather, in a sense it's a rather meaningless update, given that we will have to wait till the end of the year, anyway. I mean that interest rate, to discount that future liability, is going to be established on the last day, operating day of the month in December. And our return profile is going to be built up to the second half of the year. 
But you are quite correct as you point out, with the movement in interest rates, we feel even more confident in that $800 million and if we were to update it, we’d have even more expansions going to 2008. But we will give you tremendous detail on that as we close out the year and move in to 2008 in January. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks. Let's go to the next question please. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Bill Shope, J.P. Morgan 
Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan
Okay, great, thanks. Can you give us a sense on whether we should expect to see a material improvement in the GTS margins in the third quarter from the cost reductions you have taken or will it be more backend loaded this year? 
Mark Loughridge
Sure, a very good question. Remember that, in the first quarter we said that we had a cost problem in our ESSO business, predominantly in the U.S., and we needed to take actions to solve that problem. With that, we said that we are going to do restructuring actions, which we carried out through the second quarter. Again, I want to really compliment that team, both the GTS team and the delivery team for carrying that out and doing such an effective job of running their business. 
If you look at the margin impact of that, the GTS margin in the second quarter was 8.6%. That 8.6% had about a six-tenths of a point impact from the additional restructuring. So if it were not for that additional impact, and I only am taking out the incremental year-to-year that we attributed to the GTS business, we just took out that increment then margins would be relatively flat at about 9.2%. 
Now when you look at the yield on it, most of that restructuring impact was taken in the U.S. and in the Americas, because of that it has a very rapid yield. So, we’ll return almost all of that incremental restructuring in one quarter. So, as we look at the third quarter, even though we spent another $58 million in restructuring, in the second, we will get back almost equal that amount, if not, a little more in the third quarter. 
If you do the math against that, that would put us right at about the 10% mark. So, I feel pretty confident that the GTS business should be able to achieve about 10% margins as we go into second half of the year. 
Patricia Murphy
Okay thanks, Bill, let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Harry Blount, Lehman Brothers. 
Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers.
Hi, Mark. Continuing the question line on the services side equation, you mentioned a number of changing profile dynamics both in terms of booking some existing customers, the growth in India, things of that sort. Can you help us understand if that trend continues what the implications are going to be in terms of revenue yields and/or margins on the services business, longer term, you've kind of mentioned the impact of margin improvement restructuring, what about your mix? 
Mark Loughridge
Okay. Same point. Again, to establish the answer, let's again start with the second quarter. Second quarter for services, I mean, we had 10% growth that actuate on both sides, both GBS and GTS. And I got to tell you, we have never been in such a strong position in both of those service units, since I have been in this job. So, as I look at second half of the year, we've got a strong position in both of those units now. Across IBM, we do face couple of comparisons going to the second half of the year on our labor based businesses especially had seasonality affects in Europe. But nevertheless, those two businesses are under best shape that we've had as we go into the second half. So, I think the actions that we are seeing on the revenue side should continue as we move into the second half of the year. 
Now we’ve already talked about the GTS margin, let's talk a bit about GBS. GBS has had a tremendous margin expansion over the last two years that has been really operationally delivered with growth, improved utilization, contract management really effective management focus. So, we are looking for some expansion on the GBS side as well. 
So as I look at one, I am very confident, I think those teams really delivered on a strong second quarter, and we are looking to that to continue as we go into the second half, albeit the second half does have some challenging compares. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Harry. Let's go to the next question please. 
Operator
And our next question comes from Louis Miscioscia of Cowen 
Louis Miscioscia - Cowen & Company
Okay. Thank you. So, at the analyst meeting you mentioned five different things, the revenue growth, margin expansion, share repurchase, future acquisitions and retirement benefits. Could you maybe slice and bite those for us a little bit, maybe say the ones that you have a higher degree of confidence and it may be the one that might be more of a difficulty for you to achieve just so we could try to measure whether its all achievable or a proportionate, and the one that's on the lower end, if you could mention, why? 
Mark Loughridge
Okay. Fair enough. Let's think about it in terms of the latest data point we all have, which is second quarter performance. So, if you are looking at that same chart that we use in our EPS roadmap, first of all, we said the first level was to continue our historical revenue growth of at least 3%. Well in this quarter, we did 9%, actual 6% at constant currency. So, we certainly achieved that element of the model. 
Then we are looking for margin expansion and we've said that margin expansion on an ongoing basis shouldn’t be above four-tenths. Now, that margin this quarter was relatively flat, but as I pointed out it was impacted by those two events. First of all, we took more restructuring to fix our cost problem in GTS, and given that, that has one quarter payback, that was pretty widely spent, I think. 
And then, we also had the interest expense for the additional debt to fund the ASR, and I think that was pretty widely spent as well. So, if you extract those two just to get the kind of the operational underpinnings, I would say that those are indications that we are on track for margin expansion, as well as, we track to our longer-term goals. 
Then we look at share repurchase, and obviously we are on track here. I mean, we executed the largest ASR that we know of by a factor of four. So, the share repurchases are certainly well on track. 
Now, let's look at growth initiatives and future acquisitions. That total we are looking to contribute another two points for growth initiatives and another potential two to three points from acquisitions. In fact in this quarter, as you look at that 3% historical revenue growth going to 6%, we got about half of that increment from acquisition and half frankly from operational performance against those growth initiatives. So, I would say we are relatively on-track for both of those in this particular quarter and then the retirement related year-to-year costs of anything. We see a more rapid uptake, on those retirement related costs given the interest rate environment and the returns that we are seeing in our pension funds. So to me, I would check each of those boxes often say second quarter would say we are on-track. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Lou. Let's go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you the next question comes from Richard Farmer, Merrill Lynch. 
Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch
Thanks Mark. I would like to ask you to elaborate a little on the mainframe cycle and the timing of the refresh you had MIPS growth of 45% eight quarter of growth looking pretty strong for what ought to be kind of late in the cycle. So, as we look into the second half, what are your expectations for that business, should we start to see that taper off more aggressively or can we still expect that kind of MIPS growth in the second half? 
Mark Loughridge
Well, you use exactly the right metric. Richard as you looked at that, I mean the eighth consecutive quarter of growth on this cycle. Let's think about, when is the last time we had eight quarters in a row of growth. You got to go back to the water cold year, back in the mid in the 90s. So, that's a long time though we haven't seen this. Why do we think that cycle is now longer and less volatile? Well, first of all I think it has a strong economic value proposition to our customer sets through virtualization, I mean virtualization and these customers for the consolidation benefit of that and scalability, this box saves a lot of money. So, it's got a strong economic proposition. But I think even more than that you can also see again especially through the metrics that we are looking at in this second quarter. We move pretty effectively into these adjacent spaces that generally we would not have had access to. So, that's again the specialty engines, those MIPS were up 130% and that's moving the z series platform into these Linux and Java spaces. 
So I think as we look at this cycle, we are seeing a different kind of a cycle than we had historically based on the way that we're managing this business. And I would expect to see longer and less volatile product cycles. We had very good MIPS growth in the quarter and we are looking to continue kind of balanced way as we go to the second half. But I don't think at least from me as I try and predict that, it's hard to use the old metrics to apply to this. It's a different business, it’s a different value proposition and now moving into newer markets. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Richard. Let's go to next question please. 
Operator
Thank you, our next question comes from Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley. 
Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley
Mark really impressive execution across the board, but one area of softness this quarter and last was the Technology business. So, what is the possibility of seeing a reaccelerated top line growth or optimizing the mix of that business to get to better earnings growth in the second half? 
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Katy, let's look at the kind of first principles on the Technology business. First principle on the Technology business, that business is established to give leadership technology to our server brands. That's the purpose. That's the economic transaction. What do we get from that? From our investments in both 200 millimeter and 300 millimeter, we are generating return on invested capital of 20%. So, if you have got investment, we only got 20%, I suggest you take those. But we get very strong investments and return on our invested capital for that technology, the objective being our server business. 
In addition, we also fill our capacity with the merchant business, and the merchant business has more volatility associated with it, there are different markets. This quarter, we saw a fall off predominantly in our game chip area. Is that going to be a big impact to the IBM Corporation, well that entire business is now 1% of our gross profit. So, we are looking at the volatility around 1%, so what’s that going to be a tenth of a percent, two-tenths plus or minus. This is going to have nothing to do with the achievability of our overall economic progress, as we move to 2010. 
I think it's a good business to run this merchant chip business. It's a nice adjunct to our base business, but it's not as we are going to go out and ramp up tremendous capacity in fab to try and capture additional share in the merchant chip business, we are not. What we are going to do is continue to reap what we think is the best technology on the planet to drive into our server brand. And I think the new P6 is a very good example. Price and performance of POWER5, three times performance of the latest titanium chip. So, that's how I would answer that question. We are looking for new merchant markets to back fill some of that game chip. Those markets take sometime. I said that we saw opportunities in wired and wireless, and I think we'll have some success in those businesses as we go through time. But the objective for that technology business is we are the best technology on a planet in the hand of our server brands. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Katy. Let's go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman Thomas Weisel. 
David Grossman - Thomas Weisel
Thank you. Mark, you are making a lot of very good progress in the initiative to expand margins and accelerate growth this year. So, as we move into 2008, excluding mix in the pension, what should we look to be the primary margin drivers next year, particularly in the second half of the year? 
Mark Loughridge
Sure. Now, it's a little early I think to be talking about 2008 specifically, but I think it's very appropriate to talk about 2008 to the length of our longer term model. So, what are we looking for on margin expansion on that longer term base, looking at about four-tenth of a point, where do we expect to get that? First of all, we are investing heavily to drive our software business, heavily to drive that software, but you can see exactly the results of those investments. Look at the composition of our overall software content, it's now 53% driven by key branded middleware and that mix percentage is up 10 points since 2004. As we continue to grow though that software business at these very high margin that software generates, just on a mix basis that's going to drive the improvement. 
Secondly, we're going to continue to drive in each of our business units for better margin improvement and better margin mix within their businesses. We saw some of that this quarter in our services. There is still opportunity for improvement. I am pleased with the improvement. I am not pleased with the end state right now. There is a lot more opportunity. And if you look at our hardware business, I think Bill Zeitler has set up the STG, a value proposition very effectively at the analyst meeting. We are looking to now exploit virtualization as an economic proposition to our customers, and with that, move our mix to higher end servers to help them solve their own costs and energy problems, and their business. So, I think all of those are going to contribute to margin expansion as we march to our model objectives. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Let's go to next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. At this time we’ve reached the final question in our queue and that comes from Andrew Neff of Bear Stearns. 
Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns
Well, that's nice, okay. So Mark just, I don’t want to follow-up on something you told before about. Again, the economy you talked a moment ago about that and said that there were some effects. 
Can you go into that in just a little more detail as to what you are seeing, what you are hearing from your customers, what led you to say that you are seeing some signs of an economic pickup? Are there indicators that you are focused on or is it just the general feedback you are getting from your sales reps? 
Mark Loughridge
Now I think that's a very fair question. If you look at it, let's start with the world trade units. I mean the agent units continue to capture rate growth, in what for us, is an exploding IT market place. I mean, the emerging countries are the bestsellers and most vibrant source of IT growth that we see anywhere. So, Asia is capitalizing on and we are delivering solutions that are tailored to the emerging economies within the Asian organization, I expect that to continue. We aren’t going to see any slowdown in China, it’s just whether we all get out there and capitalize on it. But right now we're doing very, very well and I expect that to continue. 
We see kind of a recovering economy in Europe. At 6% growth, we are roughly almost double the GDP for our business, but we saw improvement in this. Improvements that we saw in Europe and Germany, we saw them continue. And I think there is strength in the German economy that we see through our customer size and length. 
Then let's go to the Americas. As we close out the first quarter, the fallout that we did see was really only in the month of March. The question was, is that going to -- what would that portend for the future quarter? And what we saw towards the end of the quarter was that actually the economy was much more balanced than you might have saw about March. 
From our perspective, the look at the customer set within the Americas, S&B continued at a very steady attractive rate of growth of about 6%, but the industry has really popped back, and if you go through the industry chart that we have in the a supplement, all of the industries did a pretty good job here. We had a fall loss really only in industrial and that was a function of the automotive market predominately, and defense spending, and how it impacted our mix of businesses there. 
So, I saw real resurgence in that customer set and increasingly effectiveness of our execution against that demand from our U.S. and Americas team, that I once again, I think, did a very good job. So, I think it’s a very good question. 
Let me take one minute now to just wrap up the call. First of all, this was really a great quarter. I think every CFO waits for a quarter like this one, but this was a great quarter. 6% growth at constant currency, 9% of actual, but I think it’s a momentum that you see underneath that. The Americas going from 1% in the first quarter to 6%, Europe was 13% at actual, albeit half of that is driven by currency, the other half is still a local currency, a multiple, a strong multiple of the GDP. 
Asia-Pacific continued its 10% growth rate that we've seen emerging countries, going from 24% growth to 32% growth. When you break it down and let's look at it through the segment lens looking at the products that we sell in the market Globe GTS and GBS recording 10% growth at actual rates. 
Software up 13%, continuing to accelerate growth in the software business, as a function of the investments we made, and you look at the software performance in this quarter, the most remarkable part, this was not mega deal driven. In fact, we only had one deal greater than $18 million, so as I look at this, this is real sale productivity. 
Systems technology up 2%, but if you look at just at systems based under this, that was up 4%, all of that driving EPS up 19%, excluding the printer sale up 15%, and free cash flow at $2.7 billion was up $1.7 billion year-to-year, $2.9 billion quarter-to-quarter, and we did all of this, while integrating the acquisitions of FileNet, MRO, ISS, Valent and solving our cost problems that we had in Americas and so organization. So a very powerful quarter for us. Thank you very much for joining our call today and now let's get back to work.

Thanks, Patricia. In the first quarter, we delivered $22 billion in revenue, which was up 7% as reported and 4% at constant currency. We expanded gross profit margin year-to-year for the 11th consecutive quarter, driven by an improving business mix and productivity initiatives. This allowed us to ramp investments in key strategic areas to drive future growth. 
Our pretax income was up 6% and net income was up 8%. We delivered $1.21 of earnings per share, up 12% year-to-year. Our first-quarter performance demonstrated the value of our globally integrated company. We have been making investments for some time to build global capabilities. 
This quarter our very strong performance in Asia, together with improvements in Europe, more than offset weakness in the United States. Overall, this was a solid quarter, and let me say right up front, with the first quarter behind us, our view of the full year hasn't changed since we spoke in January. 
So today, I will start the discussion with our geographic results. I will focus the country-specific comments on the results at constant currency. The Americas revenue grew 1%. We had strong growth in Latin America, and Canada also grew, but the United States growth slowed and revenue was flat versus last year. 
Growth from sales to our small and medium business customers remained fairly steady; however, we experienced a slowdown in sales to large enterprises. While we had a strong close to the quarter in other geographies, the U.S. was noticeably weaker. From a sector perspective, performance in the distribution sector was strong, while the industrial, financial services and communications sectors lagged. 
Europe's revenue performance was solid, up 13% as reported and up 5% at constant currency. We had good performance in the major countries, with Germany, U.K, France and Spain all up. Most notable was the improvement in Germany, up 10%, benefiting from an improving economy and better sales execution. Asia-Pacific had solid execution and a strong economy. 
This is the third consecutive quarter of good results, with 10% growth as reported and 9% revenue growth at constant currency. This is the best performance in five years. All regions grew, with double-digit growth in Australia, New Zealand, greater China group, and Aussie in South Asia. 
Our business in Japan continued the recovery started in the second half of last year and was up 3% in the quarter. Good services assigning, improved execution and implementation of a successful sales capacity maximization program produced these results. 
Across the major geographies, the emerging countries of China, India, Brazil and Russia together grew 21%. The growth was led by China, up over 30%, and India, up 24%. Brazil grew 13% and Russia was up 1%. While these countries represent 5% of IBM's revenues, they contributed 1 point of IBM's growth rate. 
Growth in these countries is driven by customer investment to build out their infrastructures. Our total services revenue grew 8%, and 4% at constant currency. We are now separately reporting both revenue and gross margin of these two services segments. 
Global Technology Services revenue growth of 7% was consistent with performance in the fourth quarter, led by Integrated Technology Services. Global Business Services grew 9% as reported and 6% at constant currency, with improved revenue growth in all three geographies. 
Systems and Technology revenue was up 2% as reported and flat at constant currency. System p and System z both posted very strong growth, contributing to both revenue growth and margin. This was offset by an anticipated decline in Microelectronics and weaker performance in storage. 
Software grew 9% as reported and 5% at constant currency, reflecting double-digit growth in the strategic branded middleware products. Global financing revenue growth reflected an improvement in financing revenue due to an increase in assets and higher used sales. Overall, IBM's gross profit margin improved over 1 point, led by Systems and Technology and Global Business Services. 
Now we will move on to expense. We have made significant changes to the mix of our business, investing in higher value capabilities while divesting of commoditizing businesses. This has contributed to higher gross margins. In fact, our gross margin has increased over 5 points from 2002 to 2006. 
These higher value businesses also require higher operating expense. This isn't just a short-term trend, but reflects the ongoing investment required to develop and sell higher value capabilities for our clients. So consistent with the trend we saw in the fourth quarter, total expense and other income increased 11% year-to-year. 
SG&A was up 11%. Approximately 3 points of this growth is due to the impact of currency. We estimate that our investments and acquisitions drove 5 points of the growth in SG&A. We have made good progress in integrating the acquisitions completed in the second half of last year, but they are not accretive in the first year, and as a result, impact our profitability in the short term. 
The remaining 3 points of the SG&A growth was largely driven by investments we are making in our software and services business and emerging markets. RD&E was up 4%, entirely driven by acquisitions. 
We expect a similar level of total expense growth through the second quarter of this year, with some moderation of the growth rate in the second half. Typically, we highlight items that significantly impact our profit growth. 
This quarter, there were no items that are individually large enough to call out. We did have an increase in the gain from equity transactions driven by the sale of Lenovo shares. This improvement was offset by lower IP income and a higher level of workforce rebalancing. 
Let me remind you of one item that we expect to impact other income and expense in the second quarter. In January, we’ve announced the divestiture of our printer business through the creation of a joint venture with Ricoh. 
This is on track to close in the second quarter, and we estimate that the pretax gain recorded at closing will now be approximately $100 million, which is at the low end of the estimate provided in January. 
Turning to currency, IBM hedges its major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the effects of currency volatility in the year-over-year results. The impact of these hedging programs is principally reflected in other income and expense, as well as cost of goods sold. 
This quarter, hedging programs resulted in approximately $90 million of year-to-year impact to other income and expense. I'm not going to predict future currency moves, but at current spot rates we would expect revenue growth to continue to benefit from currency translation for the rest of 2007, though at a more moderate level. 
I would like to comment on one other item before we leave our discussion on spending. There are a few items in our operating results that many other companies exclude from the discussion of their earnings. 
This quarter, we absorbed over $90 million for the amortization of purchased intangibles, which is a non-cash item. We absorbed about $175 million of stock-based compensation, and we absorbed about $60 million of charges for ongoing restructuring, primarily reflecting resource-rebalancing activity. 
In addition, we absorbed about $650 million of costs and expense for retirement-related plan. These items are part of any ongoing business, and we view them in the same way as any other element of costs or expense that impact our financial statement. 
Now let's turn to cash flow. This cash flow analysis chart considers our global financing receivables as an investment to generate profit, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. In this view, net cash provided from operations, excluding the change in global financing receivables, generated $950 million, a $240 million increase from last year. 
In the first quarter of last year, we contributed $1 billion to the U.K. pension fund, while this year we made a $500 million contribution to the U.S. retiree medical trust. Excluding the significant retirement-related funding activity from both years, we generated $260 million less cash from operations this year. 
We did experience weakness in accounts receivable performance in Europe and the Americas. Action plans are in place to deliver improvements in the second quarter. We invest cash from operations in a few broad categories, capital expenditures, global financing receivables net of debt, and strategic acquisitions and we return cash to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. 
Starting with the investments, net capital expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion, up over $150 million year-to-year, reflecting increased investments in strategic outsourcing and our global infrastructure. We expect a higher level of capital expenditure investments for the remainder of 2007 in these areas and in our microelectronics business. 
Global financing receivables, net of debt, were at source of almost $3 billion, consistent with last year. And spending on acquisitions was approximately $200 million, driven by Vallent, Consul and Softek. 
We continue to drive very strong returns to shareholders. This quarter, we spent $3.4 billion to buyback over 36 million shares, with $1.4 billion remaining at the end of the quarter from our last Board authorization. Average diluted shares were 1.5 billion, down about 4% from a year ago. And in the first quarter, we paid out over $450 million in dividends. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash on hand was $10.8 billion. Of our $24 billion of debt 97% was to support our global financing business, which was leveraged at an appropriate 6.9 to 1. The remaining non-financing debt level was $700 million, and debt to capital was 2.8%. 
Now let me turn to the businesses, starting with services. Our two services segments, Global Business Services and Global Technology Services, together delivered external revenue of $12.4 billion, up 8% as reported and 4% at constant currency. Global Business Services delivered particularly strong results for both revenue and profit. 
Signings for services this quarter were $11.1 billion at constant currency. This quarter, we signed nine deals larger than $100 million, and our backlog is estimated at $115 billion. Our short-term signings, driven by demand for both our integrated technology services and our consulting and systems integration offerings, were $5.3 billion, up 10% year-to-year. This was the third consecutive quarter of signings growth in these short-term businesses. 
Our long-term signings were $5.8 billion, down 11% year-to-year. As always, it is difficult to predict exactly when deals will close. For example, on April 3, we signed a $400 million strategic outsourcing deal with Royal & Sun Alliance, a major U.K. insurer, to manage their IT infrastructure. We had anticipated that this would close in the first quarter, but it will now be included as a second-quarter signing. 
Turning to the segments, Global Business Services delivered improved results again this quarter. These improvements were driven by a combination of customer demand for our services and outstanding execution from our GBS team. 
Short-term signings were up 13% year-to-year and we were up in all geographies, led by the Americas and Asia-Pacific. In fact, this was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit short-term signings. 
Long-term signings were down 22% year-to-year, with good growth in signings for application management services, offset by declines in our U.S. federal business, where we continue to see a shift in government spending to support defense efforts. 
On a rolling four-quarter basis, GBS long-term signings are up over 20%, driven by a strong fourth quarter last year. Revenue of $4.2 billion was up 9% as reported and up 6% at constant currency and was driven by improved growth rates across all three geographies, with the strongest growth coming from Asia-Pacific. 
From an offering perspective, we saw the best growth in the areas of supply chain, business strategy, and change, and in our SOA-driven offerings, where we continue to extend our SOA leadership by helping our clients to build strategic new solutions in partnership with our software business and research. 
The revenue growth rate for Global Business Services at constant currency has improved 10 points over the past three quarters, and as a result of the operational transformation we've focused on over the past year and a half, this has been profitable growth. 
This quarter, Global Business Services' pre-tax margin was 10.5%, an improvement of two points year-to-year. And pre-tax profit dollars were up 32% or up over $110 million year-to-year. This profit expansion was driven by higher revenue growth and utilization, improved pricing and strong contract management. 
Now turning to GTS. Global Technology Services delivered revenue of $8.3 billion, up 7% as reported and 4% at constant currency. Strategic outsourcing revenue was up 6% as reported and up 3% at constant currency. 
Good growth in Asia and Europe was partially offset by weakness in the Americas. Strategic outsourcing signings this quarters were down 11%. Business transformation outsourcing revenue was flat as reported and down 3% at constant currency. 
BTO signings were up 7% year-to-year. Asia-Pacific and Europe both delivered double-digit revenue growth this quarter. The Americas continued to be impacted by a large contract renegotiation in early 2006. 
This will no longer be a drag on growth rates starting next quarter. Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 12% as reported and 9% at constant currency. ITS' signings were up 5% year-to-year. 
We continue to see progress from the changes we have implemented to improve the Integrated Technology Services business, particularly in Asia-Pacific and parts of Europe. In addition, the acquisition of Internet Security Systems, which added to our capabilities in security and intrusion protection, contributed to our revenue growth this quarter. 
Turning to margin, Global Technology Services' gross margin was flat year-to-year, but pre-tax margin declined 2.5 points or about $160 million. This includes the impact of our ISS acquisition, which helped gross margins, but taking into account amortization of intangibles and other expenses, drove over $40 million of the year-to-year pre-tax profit decline, or just over a half a point impact to our pre-tax margins. 
We increased investments in sales and delivery. We invested over $100 million more this year in technology, tools and processes to improve service delivery and customer satisfaction in our outsourced accounts. Our intention was to offset these investments with improved performance in Global Business Services, which was in fact up over $110 million. 
In GTS, we continue to improve gross margin in Europe and Asia, but we fell short in the Americas, primarily due to cost issues in our U.S. strategic outsourcing business. We're putting in place a series of actions to address our U.S. cost base, including a basic focus on resource and cost management disciplines and rebalancing of resources as we execute our global resource strategy. 
It will take us a quarter to implement the actions, but we expect to see improvement in pre-tax margin starting in the third quarter. 
Now, I'll move on to Systems and Technology. Systems and Technology Group revenue of $4.5 billion grew 2% year-to-year and was flat at constant currency. Growth in Asia-Pacific and Europe was offset by a decline in the U.S. 
System z revenue grew 12%, fueled by double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific and Europe. MIPS grew 9%, marking seven consecutive quarters of year-to-year MIPS growth and longer than any product cycle in recent history. 
This sustained growth is supported by a strong demand for traditional mainframe engines, especially engines for Linux and Java and growing recognition of System z as the premier tool for large-scale virtualization. As a result, we're seeing new clients and new work coming to the platform and leveraging our latest technology. 
System z performance also reflects continued good sales execution, and we believe we gained market share. System i revenue was down 13% year-to-year as sales of upgrades remained weak. Actions taken to reduce costs, together with sales of high-margin capacity-on-demand upgrades, drove improved margins year-to-year. 
System p revenue grew 14% at actual rates and 10% at constant currency. This reflects revenue and share growth since the introduction of Power5+ technology in July of 2006. We continued to see strong growth in our high-end machines, as well as our capacity on demand offerings, extending our price performance leadership and positively contributing to margins. 
Customers continue to leverage System p's native virtualization to consolidate multiple smaller servers into high-end System p. Systems x server revenue grew 7% and 4% at constant currency. We expect to maintain market share. Consistent with industry market dynamics, our units declined slightly year-to-year, driven by virtualization. Virtualization is causing a consolidation of server deployments on a single system, and this is playing to IBM's strengths across our server platform. 
System x blade units grew 12% year-to-year. However, our revenue growth is flat year-to-year as a result of an unusual amount of operating lease activity. Normalizing for this deferred activity, blade’s revenue growth would have been more in line with volume. 
System storage was down 1% as reported and down 4% at constant currency. Storage had a weak quarter after a solid second half of 2006. External disk was down year-to-year, principally driven by declines in the U.S. We did not execute in a very competitive market in high-end and mid-range storage. 
Our tape business was flat year-to-year, holding share in that market. We believe we held share in total storage this quarter. Microelectronics revenue declined 7%, compared to a very strong first quarter last year. We anticipated that demand would moderate in 2007 as last year's games platform launches drove significant early production volume. 
During the first quarter, we announced a joint development agreement with Freescale Semiconductor on 45-nanometer technology. We also began production of our 65-nanometer cell broadband engine chip in our East Fishkill facility. 
Software segment revenue was $4.3 billion, up 9% year-to-year as reported and 5% at constant currency. Software growth was again fueled by our branded middleware portfolio, which delivered 17% growth as reported and 13% at constant currency, which is nearly twice the market growth rate. 
Leadership products and strong customer loyalty drove double-digit growth in WebSphere, Information Management, Tivoli and Rational. Our recent acquisitions performed well in the first quarter, and had a significant positive effect on our Information Management and Tivoli brands. In fact, our acquisitions generated more than half of our branded middleware growth this quarter. 
Organic growth slowed from a robust level in the fourth quarter, as some large customers in the U.S. delayed their purchasing decisions. Offsetting this growth was a modest decline in our operating systems and other middleware, which comprise about one-third of our software revenue. These products are more mature and provide a strong flow of revenue and profit despite their modest revenue decline. 
Turning to our key middleware brands, the WebSphere family of software grew 14%, as reported and 10% at constant currency. We continued to build a robust portfolio of WebSphere products to realize the promise of service-oriented architectures. We are recognized as the market leader in SOA and continue to gain share with our WebSphere brand. 
Information Management revenue was up 20% year-to-year, and 16% at constant currency. We also gained share in the Information Management brand. Momentum in our distributed relational database continued, posting double-digit growth year-to-year. We believe we gained share against our top competitor. 
The Information On Demand portfolio builds value around our core database business. It enables our customers to integrate, analyze and optimize the disparate information across their enterprise. These offerings grew 28% in the first quarter. Results were also strong in the enterprise content management product set, which was bolstered by the FileNet acquisition. 
Tivoli software grew 18% and 14% at constant currency. We believe Tivoli continue to gain share in all three of their product segments, Systems Management, Security and Storage with strong contribution from our most recent acquisitions, MRO, Vallent and Consul. 
Lotus software grew 7% and 3% at constant currency. Our Lotus products provide customers with collaborative solutions that integrate people, data and business processes as a part of IBM's on-demand and SOA strategies. Customer loyalty to our Lotus products remains strong, as evidenced by 10 consecutive quarters of growth. We believe we held share this quarter. 
Rational software grew 15% and 11% at constant currency. Rational's products provide an integrated approach to the governance of software development and delivery. This is resonating well with customers, as evidenced by this acceleration in Rational growth. 
We believe we gained share this quarter, growing at roughly twice the market rate. For total middleware, we believe we again gained share in the quarter. Software pretax profit was up year-to-year, despite a decline in pretax margin, driven by our investments in acquisitions. Now I will wrap up. 
We have been investing for decades to extend our global reach. In the local markets, we have deep local routes with local management teams who understand our clients and their business challenges. At the same time, we have global scale that enables us to leverage investments and infrastructure and drive productivity and efficiency. 
Our business is uniquely global, with about 60% of our revenue generated outside the U.S. and about 65% of our employees outside of the U.S. including 30% in Asia-Pacific. This quarter, we had very powerful result outside of the U.S., which allowed us to overcome relatively weak U.S. performance, and post solid results overall. 
The performance was led by Asia-Pacific, with 9% revenue growth. Asia had solid contribution from all key regions and continued recovery in Japan. The strategy is put in place over the last several years to focus on high-growth emerging countries are paying off, and when combined with strong execution, produced these results. 
Europe's performance improved, posting its best growth rate in a year and a half. Several of the major countries grew, led by Germany at 10% growth. Our revenue from emerging markets grew 21%. These are among the fastest growing IT markets in the world. 
Over the next four years, we expect these markets to grow at more than two times the worldwide rate, with an opportunity of over $150 billion by 2010. We are investing to extend our leadership in emerging markets. 
From a brand perspective, our high-value software business was led by our strategic middleware portfolio, and provided about 40% of our segment pretax profit. 
Global Business Services accelerated its revenue growth, and when coupled with margin expansion, generated pretax profit growth of over 30%. GBS margin performance, together with growth in our software and high-end server businesses, contributed to an improvement in IBM's total growth and net margins. 
Overall, we delivered 12% earnings per share growth in the quarter. At the same time, we have some areas that we’ll continue to focus on. We're taking actions to improve the profitability of the Global Technology Services business, and we need to improve sales effectiveness in the U.S. 
So, what does this mean going forward? Our financial objective is to deliver 10% to 12% earnings per share growth over the long term. Taking this first quarter performance into consideration, and a steady economic environment, we would expect earnings per share growth for the full year to be in the middle of the long-term range, or around 11% growth. 
Including the gain from the sale of our printer business, we expect our earnings per share growth to be closer to 12%. Bottom line, we believe earnings per share growth in 2007 will be in line with our long-term objectives. 
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, let me comment on two items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark's prepared remarks. And as always, I would ask you to refrain the multi-part questions, to allow us to take questions from more callers. 
Okay, operator, please open it up for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns. 
Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns
Thanks very much Mark. I just want to go back to the issue of the weakness in the Americas. Do you think those, when you come down to it, was that IBM-related? Do you think that was market-related? What is going on there? 
And then the converse thing for Asia, do you think it is the same thing? Is it IBM or is it the market? 
Mark Loughridge
Well, you know, if you look at it, I am not going to make an economic forecast here. If you look at the U.S., however, we did see weakness, predominantly at the end of the quarter, in our enterprise space. 
Really, SMB did fine, especially consistent with prior rates. I do expect that we’ll see improvement in the U.S. as we go into the second quarter. Now, if you look at the other geographies, I mean, we had a spectacular quarter in Asia-Pacific. 
As we said, three of the regions were in strong double-digit growth. We had another good quarter in Japan. So Asia-Pacific did really a terrific job, and I think that is a combination of, obviously, the local economy, but also our execution within that economy. 
Now, you take Europe, I think Europe showed a lot of performance in this quarter, and if you look at Germany, remembering that Germany is our third-largest country, Germany up 10% is a huge rebound for that country. 
So I am quite encouraged by our world trade performance. I mean, if you kind of characterize this quarter, it’s really a geographical performance quarter where the world trade units did a terrific job. We do have some work to do in the U.S., but I am confident we’ll see some improvement as we go into the second quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Andrew, let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Yes, thank you. I would just like to follow up on that question, please. Put another way, do you actually think the weakness in the U.S. was pushed out to next quarter, or do you believe that we are at a fundamentally lower demand level than perhaps you anticipated at the beginning of the year? 
And to substantiate that, maybe you could comment on what your backlog or pipeline looks like in software and services. You had mentioned in both, particularly in software and the organic business that some large deals may have been pushed out to next quarter. And on services, you had mentioned some signings that also occurred early this quarter. So, basic question is, is this push-out or weaker demand, and can you comment on your pipeline for software and services? 
Mark Loughridge
Well, first of all, as you look at, I would answer that with the information that I have at my disposal, which is kind of the skew of business within the U.S. And the U.S. had actually a pretty good January and a pretty good February. 
The falloff was really in the last month of the quarter. And as I said earlier Toni, that was predominantly in our enterprise customer set. Now, if you look at the deals, we certainly did have some deals roll over into the quarter. 
And if you look at the pipeline, as we would look at it across our business lines, we think we have a pretty good pipeline as we go into the second quarter. We are taking actions to improve our performance in the U.S. as we move into the quarter. And we have confidence in those. 
So I think it is kind of a combination of the two. It was, as I had said earlier, predominantly an enterprise, it was really the third month of the quarter. We did see some deals roll out of the quarter. And as we look at our pipeline going into the second, we feel that it is a pretty good pipeline on a global basis, and we see some improvement, I think, in U.S. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Toni, let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Next question is from Laura Conigliaro with Goldman Sachs. 
Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs
Yes, first of all, I don't really understand your comment about why you are confident that you are going to be seeing improvements in the second quarter in the U.S., particularly since you just indicated that it really was the end of the second quarter, excuse me, the end of the first quarter where you saw some of the issues. 
Also, can you give us more detail about the weakness that you referred to as accounts receivables performance in Europe and the Americas? 
Mark Loughridge
Yeah, I would say, first of all, I would look at the overall pipeline and opportunity moving into the second quarter globally first. And I just said that we had a really spectacular performance out of Asia-Pacific, and we see that trend in Asia continuing as we go into the second quarter. 
We saw real improvements in Europe, led by Germany, up a rather strong 10%. We see Europe continuing as we go into the second quarter. And as we look at the pipeline, Laura, we see encouraging signs in the pipeline, especially since the issues that we saw really in the U.S. were more a function of just the most recent month of March, not necessarily January and February. 
So all of those things together encourage me that one, we can do better as we go into the second quarter, improving to modest growth in the U.S., but I do expect a very similar story on a global level, that that will be highly supplemented by real performance out of our Asia-Pacific organization, number one, and pretty strong performance out of Europe, especially the work we saw in Germany. 
Now to your second question on accounts receivable, really that was some issues we saw accounts receivable in Americas and Europe in the first quarter. Those shortfalls are relatively small. If you look at it on a day’s sales outstanding basis, the impact was about two days. We have identified root cause and we are going to fix that as we go into the second quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Laura. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Our next question is from Louis Miscioscia with Cowen & Company. Sir your line is open. 
Louis Miscioscia - Cowen & Company
Yes. Thank you. I have got -- this is Lou Miscioscia, Cowen. Two questions on Services, the first one is that when we look at the PTI margin, would you expect a modest increase sequentially as we go throughout the year? 
And the second question is also in the Services area, but more from a macro standpoint. Couple years ago, Accenture decided to go directly after application maintenance and development head-to-head with the Indian guys, obviously great growth, great margins. And I think IBM still has not done that. Could you mention why and if that policy is going to change? 
Mark Loughridge
Well, first of all, let's start with your question on GTS margins. I mean, if you look at GTS margins, I would start from a little higher level on GTS. We had good revenue performance, gross profit margins was flat. We did make specific investments in the quarter about $100-$110 million that we expect to see efficiencies improvements and productivity when go through the year. 
So my kind of planning view of this is that in second quarter, we'll be working to improve our cost structure, predominantly in SO in the United States. And we are going to see those margins for GTS improve as we go into the third quarter into a more normal range, about 9% to 10%. 
Now, as far as your question on Accenture versus IBM in application maintenance, I mean, if you look at our overall performance in GBS, I mean GBS had a terrific quarter for us. The number one, let's look at signings. I mean, it was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in signings. 
Long-term signings on a four-quarter rolling average were up 22. We did have, as you know, strong revenue performance out of GBS as well, up 6% at constant currency, 9% at actual rates. But I would go right to the profit line. 
I mean, full-year 2005, we are up 13%, full-year 2006, up 37%, first quarter '07, up 32%. Big margin improvements. And with that, if you broke down the headcount behind that, we have a very powerful organization in India that’s driving application work. 
So, I think we've got a very competitive history and a very powerful performance out of that organization this quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Next question is from Ben Reitzes with UBS. 
Benjamin Reitzes - UBS
Could you talk a little bit more about hardware, in particular, I mean the UNIX business there had some decent numbers, but those were off of relatively easy comps, and the overall performance flat year-over-year. I would assume that is not what you wanted? 
And what is going to happen to get that business better? Perhaps, maybe, you can touch on POWER6 in the back half of the year, and maybe some benchmarks for the microelectronics business as well? 
Mark Loughridge
Well, first of all, let's talk about the performance within the quarter. Number one, we did have pretty good performance out of the high-end server content, specifically in z and p. And I think both of those did very well. 
If you look at z, revenue was up 12% actual, 8% at constant currency. Gross margin was up very strong in the quarter. MIPS grew 9%. So, I think we had pretty done good performance out of our z content. 
P was again very strong, up 14% and 10%. Gross margins, again, up very strong. So, I think especially underneath the high-end server content in p, we had a very good quarter. 
As far as POWER6 is concerned, we do see that entering the product line in IMP in the back half of '07. If you walk down the product line, I mean, the issue we had in System i was one that we've had for some period of time. Revenue was down in that product line, 13% at actual, 16 at constant currency. This is not a new phenomenon for us to deal with. 
System x, I think, did okay. They were up 7%, up 4%. We worked through some of the inventory and brought our weeks of inventory down in the channel. So I think we are in a pretty good shape as we go into next quarter. 
System storage, I think, could have done a better job here. They came off of a back half of last year, a very strong performance. And we look for that to do better as we go into the next quarter. 
I mean microelectronics is now wrapped around the effects that we've seen in the game business. But actually, we did very well in margins there as we achieved more favorable mix towards higher-margin ASICs products. So, I think that gives you a profile of our hardware business and where we see it going. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Ben. Let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Next question is from Harry Blount with Lehman Brothers. 
Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers
Thanks Mark. You once again reiterated the 10% to 12% earnings growth, and many of us are now going to have to look much more closely at our '08 estimates. 
Given that the pension should be a contributor in the neighborhood of $0.30 or more a share positive next year, that’s well -- approximately half of what the long-term EPS growth projection is? 
So, with that as a backdrop, should we expect anything structurally different based on what you see today, either in terms of your share buyback, your core revenue growth or the margin profile from a longer-term perspective? 
Mark Loughridge
Well, as you look at 2008, first of all, I think it is a little early for us to be talking about where we see 2008 going. But to your point, I mean, there is no doubt about it, that given our current view of pensions, it’s going to be a very strong tailwind as we go into next year. 
And as you know, if you look back the last couple of years, we have been fighting that impact every year as we went into the performance here. So based on current assumptions and our view of current interest rates, no doubt about it that should be a tailwind as we go into 2008. 
And as we start working on our view of 2008, we will be more explicit on how that plays in. The caution I would give you is obviously pensions are highly dependent on interest rate assumptions. 
If you look at that liability movement of the quarter or point to move that liability by as much as $1 billion. So, I would like to see it get a little closer at the end of the year, see where interest rates are stabilizing before we start predicting where that is going to go. 
But there is no doubt about it, big tailwind for 2008 in our current view of pensions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Harry. Let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Next question is from Richard Gardner with Citigroup 
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
Okay. Thank you very much. Just two quick ones. One, I hate to beat a dead horse, but Mark I was hoping you could clarify any color that you are able to give regarding verticals or products and services that were particularly affected by the U.S. weakness? 
And secondly, I was wondering if you could comment on the lack of BTO growth. I realized that contract re-negotiation is having an impact there, but can you talk about other factors that are impacting the business and whether the business is living up to your expectations, your growth expectations ex that particular re-negotiation? Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge
Well, once again, on the U.S. weakness, it is really, I think, a function of the quarterly skew and what we saw in the business, though, which, as you look at it, we had a pretty good January and February; March was weaker, and we did see a fall off in the third month of the quarter. 
In all of the other geographies, we had a very strong third month of the quarter. So, it did have signs of some softness, but beyond that, I think we have a pretty good execution plan to improve that performance to modest growth, I think, in the U.S. as we go into the next quarter. 
Now, I would say from a sector perspective, performance in the distribution sector was very strong, while we did have our industrial, financial services and communications sectors are lagged. But I am more confident that as we go into the second quarter, we will see some improvement to more modest growth in the United States. 
I am very confident that this worldwide phenomenon that we see, capitalizing on the resurging growth we see in Europe, as well as the very powerful growth in Asia-Pacific, will continue to drive performance as we go into the second quarter. 
As far as BTO growth, that was impacted by a specific contract re-negotiation. As we go into next quarter, we get out from under that, so you will see improvements in BTO as we get into the second quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
And I will remind you we did also see growth in BTO signings this quarter as well. 
Mark Loughridge
And actually that is exactly right. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Richard. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Richard Farmer with Merrill Lynch. 
Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch
Thanks a lot, Mark. I would like to follow-up on the software business. You have talked a lot about the U.S. customer during the purchasing discussions, and that caused a deceleration. 
Forgive me if I missed it in your prepared remarks, but I didn't hear as much commentary on the gross margin, which was down year-over-year. Can you provide some more explanation of what was driving that gross margin change, and going forward, what should we expect on the profitability front for the software business? Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge
Really, the gross margin impact -- that was about six-tenths of a point decline. It was really driven by acquisitions on a lower mix of our operating system software. So, overall, acquisitions had a very powerful performance in the quarter, but you did see that six-tenths of a point impact. 
Patricia Murphy
Okay. Thanks, Richard. Let's go to the next question please. 
Operator
Next question is from David Grossman with Thomas Weisel Partners. 
David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners
Thanks. Mark, you mentioned several times in your presentation about rebalancing headcount. And I am wondering is that just limited to Services, and how is that rebalancing impacting the P&L currently? And you could perhaps connect the dots for us on how that's going to impact the margins going forward? 
Mark Loughridge
Yeah, sure. If you look at overall restructuring, there's always going to be some level of restructuring in every quarter. And we could include that in our operating performance. So, as you look at the second quarter, we will again have some restructuring, but it is not going to be a typical, especially on a year-to-year basis, I mean the year-to-year impact will be pretty modest, I think. 
On the other hand, if you look at how we are utilizing that, we’re going to utilizing a much larger share of that existing operational rebalancing in our GTS organization, specifically SO, specifically the United States. So, with those actions in the second quarter, we see that overall GTS margins should improve by the third quarter in the range of 9% to 10%. And I think we should really see some operating improvement in that business within the second quarter as well. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, David. Let's take one more question, please. 
Operator
Our last question comes from Bill Shope with JP Morgan. 
Bill Shope - JP Morgan
Okay, thanks. I have a quick question on blade servers. Even with the adjustments for operating leases that you mentioned, the blade server growth has been, I would say, somewhat sluggish, at least relative to historical numbers, for the past few quarters. 
Can you give us some color on what is driving this? Has there been any fundamental change in the market potential, or is this really just a market share issue, specific to IBM, that you guys could potentially turnaround in the near-term? 
Mark Loughridge
Well, once again, let's look at the data. First of all, volumes were up 12% without this operating lease impact, the System x blades would be up 13%, which we believe held share in the quarter and did show quarter-to-quarter improvement on a growth rate basis. So I think it performed with the market, it held share, and it's a very strong part of our xSeries portfolio. 
Patricia Murphy
Okay, thanks, Bill, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.

 Mark Loughridge
Thanks Patricia. We had a very strong finish to the year. We delivered $26.3 billion in revenue, which was up 7% as reported and 4% at constant currency. Our pre-tax income was up 5% to $4.8 billion and we delivered $2.26 of earnings per share, including a $0.06 benefit from a lower tax rate. Our EPS was up 12% year-to-year. Excluding the one-time pension curtailment charge from the 2005 results, EPS was up 7%. 
This quarter, we had the best software revenue growth in over five years, with continued momentum in our strategic middleware, and additional benefit from our recent acquisitions. Our focus on building up our software capabilities is clearly paying off. The profile of our services business continued to improve. Revenue growth accelerated in the quarter, and we had exceptional signings performance, closing almost $18 billion of new business. 
From a geographic perspective, the Americas and Asia Pacific posted the strongest growth, with a solid recovery in Japan and good contribution from emerging countries. 
 We are driving productivity initiatives across the business. At the same time, we’re ramping investments to drive future growth. 
And once again we had strong cash performance, with an increase in net cash from operations for the year of $2.2 billion, excluding Global Financing Receivables. 
Let’s move on to our full year performance with Chart 4. Our full year performance was the result of a series of actions we’ve taken over the last several years to improve our mix of businesses and globally integrate the company. We delivered $91.4 billion of revenue, pretax earnings of $13.3 billion, and earnings per share of $6.06. We expanded margins, had record cash performance, and provided record return to shareholders. In summary, we had a strong fourth quarter and 2006, and we feel good about the momentum of our business as we enter 2007. 
But before moving on, I’d like to add some perspective to our profit performance on the next chart. There are a few items in our operating results that many other companies, especially in the tech sector, exclude from the discussion of their earnings. 
For example: 
These items are part of any ongoing business, and we view them in the same way as any other element of cost or expense that impacts our financial statement. 
Now before getting into the details of the fourth quarter results, I’ll make a brief comment on the structure of our presentation. This quarter we completed the acquisition of Integrated Security Systems, a business that protects a clients’ IT infrastructure against intrusion through a combination of software and managed services. This is consistent with our strategy, which capitalizes on a trend toward the convergence of software and services. 
The long term value of ISS is in managed services, and ISS is now an integrated business within Global Technology Services – and reported in the Global Technology Services segment. But because some of the value is being delivered through software licenses, this activity will be classified as software sales on the income statement. 
Going forward, we will consistently focus our discussion on the segment view, as this is how we are managing our businesses, and the best reflection of our strategy. Let’s now turn to IBM’s external segment revenue. IBM’s fourth quarter revenue was up 7% as reported, 4% at constant currency. Performance was led by Software, reflecting strong demand for our industry-leading middleware portfolio. Revenue was up 14% as reported and up 11% at constant currency. 
Global Technology Services revenue grew 7% as reported and 4% at constant currency. The acceleration in growth was driven by Integrated Technology Services, with progress in the implementation of our new offerings, and contribution from the newly-acquired ISS business. 
Global Business Services grew 6% as reported and 3% at constant currency, led by solid performance in consulting. 
Systems and Technology revenue was up 3% as reported, and flat at constant currency. 
The best performance came from Storage, and Retail Store Systems. Our System z revenue improved year-to-year, and as anticipated, Microelectronics revenue declined as it wrapped around on a very strong fourth quarter of 2005. 
Global Financing revenue was up 3% as reported, and flat at constant currency, with a modest improvement in financing revenue due to an increase in assets. 
 Overall, IBM’s gross profit margin improved a half a point, led by services, and a mix toward our higher margin software business. 
I’ll address the margin dynamics in the discussion of the segments. 
Looking at our revenue by geography, as always, I’ll focus my comments on the results at constant currency, to provide the best view of the underlying business performance. The Americas revenue grew 5%. From a product perspective, the Americas’ growth was again driven by software. By region, the best performance came from Latin America, with double-digit revenue growth. The U.S. also grew, while Canada had a modest decline. Europe’s revenue was up 3% year-to-year, an improvement from the growth rate in the third quarter. Of the major countries, Italy had the best performance, and the U.K. also improved year-to-year. 
Asia Pacific also delivered strong results with revenue up 5% in the quarter. The Asia Pacific economy remained strong, led by India and China. Our business in Japan returned to growth in the second half of the year. This is an important market for us, as Japan represents over half of the Asia Pacific revenue base – and is the second largest country globally in terms of revenue and profit. 
The emerging countries of China, India, Brazil and Russia together grew 18%. India and Russia both posted growth of over 30%. China grew 18%, and Brazil grew 9%. For the year, these four countries contributed $4.5 billion of revenue, up 16% year-to-year without the divested PC business in last year’s results. 
We continue to invest to build capabilities in these countries, to address the fast-growing domestic market opportunities, and to enhance IBM’s globally integrated operations. 
Finally, our OEM revenue was down 3%, after four consecutive quarters of very strong growth. Now we’ll move on to expense. 
I’m going to spend a little more time on expense this quarter, as it is important to understand the dynamics, and the investments that we are making. Total Expense and Other Income increased 16% in the quarter, excluding last year’s pension charge. Excluding currency impacts and the year-to-year impact from real estate transactions, total expense growth would have been 9%. 
SG&A was up 13%. Approximately four points of this growth is due to the impact of currency. We estimate that our investments in acquisitions drove four points of the growth in SG&A. While it can take some time for these investments to be fully accretive, we are encouraged by the accelerated pace with which we have integrated acquisitions and the contribution from the acquired businesses within the fourth quarter. 
The remaining 5 points of the SG&A growth was largely driven by investments we are making in our software and services business and emerging markets. Like the acquisitions, productivity of the sales resource improves over time. The returns on these investments are reflected in the momentum in our key middleware brands, growth in emerging markets, and strong signings performance. 
RD&E was up 9%. Acquisitions drove approximately half of this growth, with the remainder reflecting our ongoing commitments to maintain our technology leadership across our product portfolio. We expect a similar level of expense growth during the first half of 2007, driven by investments in strategic areas with some moderation of the growth rate in the second half. To help mitigate some of the impact, we expect to continue to expand gross margins, globalize our support functions, and rapidly integrate new acquisitions. 
I also want to highlight a couple of other items that significantly impacted our profit growth. We refer to these as our “roadmap” items. 
The first is gains on real estate transactions, which are recorded in Other Income and Expense. In the fourth quarter of last year, we had unusually high gains in the quarter due to a few large transactions. While we did have some real estate activity in the fourth quarter of this year, the gains were down $140 million year-to-year. 
Second, retirement-related plans generated about $600 million of cost and expense in the quarter. This is an increase of about $80 million year-to-year, excluding last year’s pension curtailment charge. The retirement-related plans cost over $2.4 billion for the full year, up about $325 million over the prior year, excluding the 2005 non-recurring charges. 
For 2007, the interest rate environment together with other factors such as actuarial assumptions will result in retirement-related expense of about $2.5 billion, an increase of less than $100 million year-to-year. 
I’ll comment on two other items, tax rate and currency. 
In the fourth quarter, we recorded an effective tax rate of 28%, down from the previous ongoing rate of 30%. For the full year 2006, IBM’s effective tax rate was 29.3%. Looking forward to 2007, we expect a rate in the range of 28.5%. The improved rate is the result of a more favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions, and the ongoing benefit from the R&D credit passed by Congress in December. 
On currency, IBM hedges its major cross-border cash flows and, as a result, mitigates the effect of currency volatility in the year-over-year results. The impact of these hedging programs is principally reflected in Other Income and Expense, as well as cost of goods sold. I’m not going to predict future currency moves, but at current spot rates we would expect revenue growth to benefit from currency translation in the first half of 2007. 
 Now let’s turn to Cash Flow. 
We had another outstanding year in cash generation. As you know, this cash flow analysis chart has one primary difference from the FAS 95 format. It considers our Global Financing Receivables as an investment to generate profit, not as Working Capital that should be minimized for efficiency. 
For 2006, Net Cash Provided from Operations, excluding the year-to-year change in Global Financing Receivables, was $15.3 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion from last year, and the highest on record. Excluding the significant pension funding activity in the U.S. in 2005 and the U.K. in 2006, we generated $1.5 billion more cash from operations year-to-year. Our year-to-date cash performance was driven primarily by growth in Net Income, and continued focus on working capital. 
Turning to our investing activities, net capital expenditures were approximately $4.7 billion, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion year-to-year. The growth was driven by the unusually high level of real estate asset sales in 2005, and increased spending in support of strategic outsourcing contracts. 
Let me make a subtotal here since many investors look at cash flow after Capital Expenditures. We generated cash flow of $10.5 billion, up about $960 million compared to last year. We have increased cash flow in each of the past four years. 
Spending on Acquisitions was $3.8 billion, up $2.3 billion year-to-year. This activity increased in the fourth quarter as we completed acquisitions announced in the third quarter, including FileNet, MRO and ISS. 
We returned a record $9.8 billion to investors this year, an increase of almost $800 million year-to-year. $8.1 billion of this shareholder return was through share repurchase, an increase of about $350 million from our spending last year. We spent a record amount on share repurchase in 2006, buying back over 97 million shares. Average fully diluted shares were at 1.6 billion, down 4.6% from a year ago. We had approximately $5 billion remaining from our Board authorizations at the end of December. IBM has bought back over 1.2 billion shares on a split-adjusted basis, at an average price of about $62 per share since the inception of our share repurchase program in 1995. 
Turning to dividends, this year we paid out about $1.7 billion, which is an increase of about $430 million year-to-year, driven by a 50% dividend increase. We continued our long history of high returns to our shareholders. This year, between share repurchase and dividends we were able to pay out over 100% of our net earnings to our shareholders, even after investing over $14 billion in R&D, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. 
Turning to the Balance Sheet, our cash on hand was $10.7 billion. 98% of our total debt of $22.7 billion was driven by our Global Financing business, and Global Financing was leveraged at an appropriate 6.9 to 1. The remaining non-financing debt level was $395 million and debt-to-capital was 1.5%. 
As anticipated, Stockholder’s Equity was down $4.6 billion year-to-year, driven by a non-cash accounting charge of about $9.5 billion for FAS 158 pension accounting, implemented in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with almost $29 billion of stockholders’ equity. Our Balance Sheet remains very strong. 
Now, let me turn to the businesses, starting with Services. 
Our two services segments, Global Technology Services and Global Business Services together delivered external revenue of $12.8 billion, up 7% as reported and 3% at constant currency. 
Signings for services this quarter were $17.8 billion at constant currency, up 55% over last year. At spot rates, we signed $20.3 billion. Our shorter-term signings were $6.2 billion, up 16% year-to-year. Our longer-term signings were $11.6 billion, up 89% year-to-year. This quarter we signed 14 deals larger than $100 million, and our backlog has increased to an estimated $116 billion. This strong finish to the quarter allowed us to grow signings for the full year, for both short term and long term. 
Turning to the segments, Global Technology Services delivered revenue of $8.6 billion, up 7% as reported and 4% at constant currency. Strategic Outsourcing revenue was up 7% as reported and up 4% at constant currency. Signings doubled year-to-year, with strong growth in all geographies. 
Business Transformation Outsourcing revenue was up 8% as reported, and up 5% at constant currency. BTO signings were down 57% year-to-year. We continue to see opportunity within the BTO business, particularly in Finance and Accounting, Human Resources and Procurement. 
Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 8% as reported and up 6% at constant currency. We continue to see progress from the changes we’ve implemented to improve the Integrated Technology Services business, including streamlining our offerings and aligning skills, to address higher growth and higher value areas. 
The acquisition of Internet Security Systems added to our capabilities in security and intrusion protection, and contributed to the ITS growth. ITS signings were up 20% this quarter, with growth in all geographies. As in the third quarter, the strongest growth came from the regions where our transformational actions were implemented first. We’re encouraged by our progress in ITS. 
Turning to margin, Global Technology Services pre-tax margin was 9.3%, down year-to-year as compared to a particularly strong fourth quarter of 2005, but in line with full year margins adjusted for the impact of the ISS acquisition. We continue to make investments in sales, delivery and business development skills across our entire set of offerings, as well as invest in strategic outsourcing infrastructure and BTO capabilities. Looking forward, we will continue to optimize resources and processes to increase productivity, and improve flexibility and scalability. This activity may be skewed a bit more towards the first half of 2007. The goal of these actions is to drive labor cost savings and increased customer satisfaction within service delivery. 
Global Business Services delivered revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% as reported and up 3% at constant currency. The constant currency growth represents a 7 point improvement since the growth rate at the end of the first half, as we’ve expanded our focus from Operational Transformation to a focus on Profitable Growth. 
Our signings this quarter reflect the strong demand for both our shorter-term and longer-term offerings. Shorter-term signings were up 14% year-to-year, where we saw strength in the larger higher value add engagements. Longer-term signings were up over 200% year-to-year, driven by our global delivery capabilities in the Application Management business. Longer-term signings were up 17% for the year. Global Business Services’ pre-tax profit was up over 30% year-to-year, and the fourth quarter pre-tax margin improved 2.3 points to 11.8%. Margin improvement was driven by improved utilization, strong contract management and delivery, and stable to improved pricing. 
Finally, I would like to talk about our signings this quarter, not the quantity or dollar value, but the quality of the deals we signed this quarter, and what they represent. The key to our success in Services will come from first, our ability to integrate our businesses globally, and to take advantage of our local and global skills; and second, from the use of the technology and industry skills required to create solutions that drive value and savings for our customers. 
We were successful on both fronts this quarter, we signed large Application Management deals at Vodafone and CMA CGM. The key differentiator for both of these is the ability to provide strong local expertise and industry skills coupled with the benefits of global delivery. We also signed large long term deals with the State of Indiana, the State of Texas, and the German Army. The value in these contracts came from our strong industry knowledge, and from the use of technology needed to drive cost savings and improve performance for our customers. 
These wins were driven by a strategy that puts technology at the forefront, and uses our scale and global capabilities to meet our customer’s diverse sets of requirements. We’ve done a lot to improve the profile of our Services business in 2006, and we are entering the year with a stronger services base. 
Now I’ll move on to Systems and Technology Group. Systems and Technology Group revenue of $7.1 billion grew 3% year-to-year, or flat at constant currency. For the full year, Systems and Technology grew 5%. 
System z revenue grew 5% year-to-year, 1% at constant currency. MIPS grew 6% against, what was, the quarter with the largest MIPS shipment on record. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of MIPS growth. 
System z performance reflected continued good sales execution and we believe we grew market share. The mainframe’s unique ability to deliver attractive economics, advanced security, and industry leading energy conservation, cooling and virtualization, play to the strength of the platform. 
System i revenue declined 10% year-to-year, 14% at constant currency. Sales of upgrades improved sequentially, however they remain down year-to-year as customers continue to leverage their existing capacity. We expect the upgrade activity to ramp during the year. 
System p revenue grew 4%, flat at constant currency. We believe we grew share in the quarter. System p had strong high-end sales extending our price/performance leadership position and raising margins. Customers are leveraging System p’s native virtualization to consolidate multiple smaller servers into high-end System p. 
System x servers grew 7% year-to-year, and 3% at constant currency. Blades were essentially flat year-to-year. We had good growth in both Europe and Asia Pacific, offset by a decline in the Americas. We expect we held share in System x in the quarter. 
Storage grew 9% year-to-year, 6% at constant currency. Disk rose 12%, with double-digit growth in both mid-range disk and SAN. DS8000 unit shipments grew over 14% year-to-year. We believe we gained share in Disk in the fourth quarter, and we extended our market leadership in tape. Tape was up 4% year-to-year on the continued strength of our new tape security offering. Together with IBM software and services, this solution provides for cost effective encryption and management of large volumes of digital information. When results are published, we believe we will retain our number one market share position in overall storage hardware. 
Microelectronics revenue declined 6% compared to a very strong fourth quarter last year. In this quarter, we met all customer demand for games processor volumes to support the launch of both Sony Playstation/3 and Nintendo Wii, while continuing to also supply Microsoft with its Xbox 360 processors. 
Our Retail Store Systems had double-digit growth rate every quarter this year, and grew about 20% for the year. Customers are replacing older technology in favor of integrated retail solutions. IBM is the market leader in this segment. 
Now, I’ll move on to Software. Software segment revenue was $5.6 billion in the quarter, up 14% year-to-year as reported, and 11% at constant currency. For the full year, software grew 8% as reported and 7% at constant currency. 
Customers are responding to the breadth of our software portfolio coupled with IBM’s unique ability to apply these technologies to their business needs. As a result, in the fourth quarter, key branded middleware delivered 25% growth as reported and 21% at constant currency, which is roughly double the market growth rate. 
This growth came from both organic sources and strategic acquisitions. In the fourth quarter all brands grew faster than the market with all of the five brands delivering double-digit growth as reported. Our major acquisitions for the year include Filenet, MRO and Micromuse which enhanced growth in the Information Management and Tivoli brands. 
The WebSphere family of software grew 22% as reported, and 18% at constant currency. WebSphere provides the foundation for web-enabled applications and is a key product set in deploying Services Oriented Architecture. We are continuing to invest in SOA technologies, which allow us to bring advanced industry-specific solutions to the market. As a result we are extending our leadership in SOA. 
Information Management software helps companies integrate, manage and gain value from their business information. For the quarter, revenue was up 28% year-to-year and 24% at constant currency. Our distributed relational database was particularly strong, growing 32%, far outpacing our next two competitors. 
Our Information on Demand portfolio was marked by the launch of the IBM Information Server on October 16th. This product is an industry-first, unified software platform that helps clients extract more value from complex information. Our IoD offerings were up 42% in the quarter. 
This quarter we concluded the acquisition of FileNet Corporation, an industry leader in enterprise content management. 
In Information Management, we grew faster than the market organically, and a strong performance from Filenet added to this growth. 
Tivoli software grew 25%, and 21% at constant currency. 
As in the third quarter, we again saw double-digit growth in each of our three key segments: Systems Management, Security and Storage. 
Systems Management grew as a result of major service providers choosing our Micromuse solutions over other competitors in the market. In the quarter we completed the acquisition of MRO software which added to our capabilities in enterprise and IT asset management. 
Lotus software grew 30%, and 24% at constant currency. Lotus benefited from strong momentum in its Notes/Domino family of collaboration products and broad adoption of its enhanced version of Sametime, which shipped in the third quarter of this year. Customer loyalty to our Lotus products remains strong as evidenced by nine consecutive quarters of growth. 
Rational software, which provides customers with tools that manage the business process of software and systems development, was up 12%, and 8% at constant currency. In a slower growing market, Rational gained share in the fourth quarter and full year 2006. 
Other Middleware was up 3%, and flat at constant currency. This segment includes more mature products which provide a stable flow of revenue and profit. Operating Systems were down, due to improved price performance in System z operating systems. 
Overall, our software business had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 14%. The pre-tax profit of over $2 billion is up 4% year-to-year, but the pre-tax margin declined as we integrated our new acquisitions. The full year pre-tax income of $5.5 billion is up nearly 15% year-to-year. We have been investing heavily in our Software business for some time, both internally and through our targeted acquisitions. This quarter’s strong results reflect those investments. 
Now, I’ll wrap up in the next four charts with a discussion on the full year performance. Over the last few years we have been steadily transforming the company. We’ve taken a series of actions – divesting of businesses that are commoditizing, while investing in targeted acquisitions to build capabilities in higher value areas. We’ve had a sharp focus on productivity, to expand margins and drive more efficiency in our business. And we have accelerated our move to a globally-integrated company. The actions we have taken have resulted in a more balanced mix of businesses, and a stronger, more competitive and sustainable global business. Our 2006 performance reflects this improved business model. 
In wrapping up 2006, I’d like to address the year from three perspectives: our business mix, our global reach, and our business model. 
First, our businesses. The largest profit contributor was our software business, with about 40% of segment pre-tax profit. This year, our leadership in technology and innovation has allowed us to continue to capitalize on industry trends, such as SOA and Information on Demand. 
Our Services revenue growth improved over the course of the year. We are getting traction in our short term businesses. Integrated Technology Services is recovering after rebalancing its offerings and resources. Global Business Services significantly improved profitability. With a great finish to the year in signings, we ended the year with a backlog of $116 billion, while maintaining our focus on strong profitability. 
In hardware, we are the leader in servers. Through continued investment in R&D, we introduced Power5+, extended virtualization capabilities, and provided leading technology for all three major game platforms. Our System z servers had a great year, and provide good profit generation across the business over time. 
We’re continuing to add to our capabilities. Over the years, we have built a targeted acquisition strategy, and we’ve developed the capability to rapidly acquire, integrate, and accelerate new product offerings. This year we spent almost $4 billion on 13 acquisitions, including nine in the software segment. And we are also continuously evaluating underperforming and less strategic areas of our portfolio. 
Our businesses are enabled by the global reach of IBM. IBM has tremendous global reach. We operate in 170 countries, with about 60% of our revenue generated outside the US. And about 65% of our employees are outside of the U.S., including 30% in Asia Pacific. This gives us access to markets, with local management teams who understand our clients and their business challenges. 
In the major countries, we are well-established. This year, we had continued solid contribution from the U.S., and improved performance in France and Italy. In the second half, our business in Japan recovered. In the emerging markets of China, India, Russia and Brazil we grew 16% in 2006. These are among the fastest growing IT markets in the world. Over the next four years, we expect them to grow at more than two times the worldwide rate, with an opportunity of over $150 billion by 2010. We’re investing to extend our leadership in emerging markets. 
At the same time, our global scale provides a base that enables us to leverage investments and infrastructure, and drive productivity and efficiency. From a sales perspective, ibm.com was our fastest growing channel in every geography. We delivered $10 billion of sales through the ibm.com telesales and web channels. In support of our clients, we expanded our global delivery centers, which is a more efficient model for services delivery. In 2006 we added capabilities to our centers in India, Brazil and Argentina, to provide the ability to seamlessly transfer workload. This year we added over 20,000 employees to our service delivery centers in low cost countries. 
We have continued the global integration of our internal support functions, such as supply chain, finance, and HR. We look for 10% to 15% productivity from the global support functions, and this year we achieved our goal. As a globally integrated company, we will continue to leverage the skills and capabilities of our global infrastructure and workforce. 
Finally, let’s look at IBM’s 2006 business model performance. In 2006, we had record profit, earnings per share, and cash performance. In the year, we grew pre-tax profit about $1 billion, and grew earnings per share by 14%, excluding last year’s non-recurring activity. Gross margins expanded for the third consecutive year. Our productivity actions and high profit levels allow us to reallocate resources and increase investment in more strategic areas of the business. 
Looking at the measures of capital efficiency, our Return on Invested Capital for the year was 34% for our core business, with a 30% Return on Equity for our financing business and we had record return to shareholders of $9.8 billion, including $8 billion for share repurchase. 
Our business model success will be measured over the long term, not any individual period. The strategies we have put in place, the investments we make, and the individual actions we take, are all with an objective of optimizing our long term performance. 
 2007 should be no different. We’ll continue to take actions to transform and improve our business. This means that any particular period may reflect the impact of those actions, as we buy and sell businesses, have gains and charges, and invest resource in some areas while moving resource out of others. So, while the timing of various activities can impact the individual quarters, at this point, it would be reasonable to assume an earnings per share distribution in 2007 similar to 2006. We do all of this in the context of managing the business for sustainability and with our long term objective in mind, to deliver 10% to 12% earnings per share growth over the long term. 
Taking all of this into consideration, and a steady economic environment, we would expect earnings per share for 2007 to again be in line with our long term model. This is also consistent with the growth in the current average estimate for earnings per share. 
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions. 
 Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A let me comment on two items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark’s prepared remarks. We have a few new charts this quarter, including a chart that bridges the software and services segment revenue to the income statement, and an estimate of retirement-related expenses based on year end 2006 assumptions. 
Also, as always, I’d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions to allow us to take questions from more callers. Operator, please open it up for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you. Profitability in your Global Technology Services group was lower than expected, and typically services profitability spikes up in the fourth quarter due to volume. Certainly it doesn’t appear on that side of the business that that happened this quarter. Can you go into a little more detail? You talked about increased infrastructure in sales as the reason behind it. You also talked about optimizing resources in the first half of ‘07. Is that a code word for saying that you will be taking out people and expense in the first half of '07 in your Global Technology Services business and we should see the benefits of that in the second half? 
 Mark Loughridge
Thanks, Toni. Let me take that question and first, look at it from an overall total services prospective. The issue that I would like to highlight first of all, that total services margin improved sequentially and year-to-year in the fourth quarter and also improved on a full-year basis. So it was really the combined fourth quarter margins as you look at it, were the highest in the past three years but were down against a very difficult compare in fourth quarter 2005. 
If you look under total services, that difficult compare was predominantly in Global Technology Services. If you look at GBS, as you can see in the results, we had very strong margin performance in GBS again this quarter with most of improvement coming from improved utilization, improved contract management and delivery discipline. I expect that momentum in our margins to continue as we go into 2007. 
For GTS this quarter, as I had said, we had a very difficult compare from the fourth quarter of 2005. The fourth quarter margins would have been flat sequentially really, adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, and we do continue to make investments in sales resource in the ITS transition area, as well as in the infrastructure supporting our SO and BTO accounts. So we believe these investments are paying off. I think you can best see them in the performance that we had in ITS. It did show improving revenue performance. 
We certainly saw improved signings performance not only here but across our services organization, and I think as you look at the profitability in our Global Technology Services it is predominantly an issue of the earlier year compare. I think if you put that margin in context for the general quarterly improvement across the year, it is not out of line. In all, an element of our overall IBM margin that was, in fact for the full year, up a point. 
 Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Toni. Let's take the next question, please. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Richard Gardner - Citigroup. 
 Richard Gardner - Citigroup 
Thank you very much. Hello, Mark. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the microelectronics business. Obviously it was down year-over-year, but based on my math, it looks like it might have been down sequentially as well, which is a bit of a surprising outcome given that you are finally shipping chips to all three major game consoles. They are all shipping at volume this quarter, and we had actually picked up some strength in the networking portion of that business. Can you give us a sense of, in addition to a tough year-over-year compare, what happened to that business sequentially and what caused what looks to be a sequential decline? 
 Mark Loughridge
 Well you know, Richard, if you look the microelectronics business, it really experienced very strong growth through the first three quarters in advance of the fourth quarter launch of new game consoles from Nintendo and Sony as well as supplying Microsoft for the holiday season. So given the seasonality of the consumer segment, we anticipated demand will continue to moderate through the first half of '07 but should improve later in the year. 
In the fourth quarter, we did experience strong growth in our communications and electronics segments, contributing to an improved margin mix as game processors growth slowed. But if you look at it over the years, despite the revenue decline of 6% in the fourth, microelectronics did grow 22% for the full year. 
So, as I look at that performance, we had very strong micro performance in the game chip platform for the year. We supplied all three game platforms. This is, in many respects, a function of the holiday season on our shipments into that. We had very strong micro performance in other elements of our technology base, and I think the strongest element of our micro platform is supplying our base server business. 
 Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Richard. Let me just correct Richard that, in fact, the revenue was up sequentially in microelectronics from third quarter to fourth quarter. 
 Mark Loughridge
 Right, good point, Patricia. 
 Patricia Murphy
 Let's go to the next question, please. 
 Mark Loughridge
Your next question comes from Bill Shope – JP Morgan. 
 Bill Shope - JP Morgan 
Great, thanks. Obviously very impressive signings numbers, so congratulations on that. My question is: how much of this was largely seasonal or some perhaps one-time deals? Looking forward, how should we think about the pipeline for the first quarter? Did you pull business in? Do you feel like you still have a solid pipeline going forward for us to go ahead and model the run-rate here? 
 Mark Loughridge
Very good question. We did have, as you all know, a very good quarter in signings, which enabled us to grow both short term 16% and long-term signings a pretty stellar 88% in the quarter, for a 55% signing growth for the quarter. In fact, if you look at it now for the full year, we have grown overall signings 4%, and we enter the year 2007 with a pretty strong backlog at $116 billion. 
So we have clearly made progress in our shorter-term business in the second half of the year, and looking at the opportunities out there in our pipeline, I expect the progress to continue into the first quarter. If you look at longer-term signings, they can be very inconsistent from quarter to quarter, and we certainly saw that in the third quarter of this year. 
So, as I look at it first from a long-term perspective, we're not going to replicate the fourth quarter performance, but we do see substantial opportunity there. If you take both the short-term trends and long-term together and look at our first quarter opportunity, we still see opportunity for growth in the first quarter. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs. 
 Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs 
Thank you. For much of the year, you have actually struggled with your hardware growth, other than a quarter or two here or there in individual categories, as well as profitability here and there. Why should we think that this is going to change on a sustainable basis? Why, in fact, were blades flat? 
Then a clarification. Could you please just tell us what your software growth would have been excluding acquisitions? 
 Mark Loughridge
 Sure. Let me take those in sequence. So, first of all, if you look at overall S&TG and you look back at 2006, two really different stories from the first half to the second. In the first half, our 3% growth was on the strength of microelectronics, while servers declined 3% and storage grew 1%. During this time, we saw areas to improve our execution and facilitate in our client's progression into the mainframe z9 technology. 
Now if you look at the second half, it is a different perspective. In the second half, our actions in working with our clients on the z platform have continued to show strong results through the fourth quarter, providing 12% growth for the half and a substantial share gain for System z. In fact, System z in the quarter was the strongest mix growth on record. 
So, as I look at S&TG going into next year, I think we've done a lot to refine our System z sales cadence and our customer strategy with our clients. Storage had a lot of momentum as we went through the fourth quarter that I expect to extend in the first. As you know, we are the leader in server share. 
Secondly, if you look at overall organic growth for software, I would like to again take you back to the fourth quarter 2006. From an external basis, software revenue grew 14% as reported and 10.6 at constant currency. 
Underneath that, branded middleware grew 25% as reported and 21% at constant currency. Organically, at constant currency, branded middleware grew 10% for the quarter. So you can see about half of that was organic, and I think if you look at this performance that we had in software in the fourth quarter, it was really, really very powerful on the organic side, very powerful on the acquired side as we quickly integrated those businesses into our global reach. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch. 
 Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch 
Mark, you mentioned the pension retirement assumptions, the actuarial assumptions might be changing. Would you mind just clarifying what are the changes in the return and the rate assumptions or other assumptions? What would be the going forward view of pension and retirement expense without those changes and assumptions? 
 Mark Loughridge
 Now I didn’t say that we are changing assumptions. Assumptions in our base return objectives have been 8% for quite awhile now; we are maintaining that at 8%. What has changed has been the interest rate environment. So all we are referencing is the change in the interest rate environment, especially at the long end of the curve and how that affects your long-term liability. 
So if you look at pension expense year-to-year, this year we expended about $2.4 billion, and we expect that to increase year-to-year by a little less than $100 million. So it will be in the range of 2.5 or a little less than that. But if you look at the supplemental, if you take those same end of year assumptions in the industry -- these are not our assumptions; they are, in fact, the interest rate that we use to calculate that long-term liability -- you can see how based on that interest rate environment, it will continue to improve, frankly, as we go into 2008 and 2009. I think the graphic that we provided is pretty clear there. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers. 
Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers 
Hi, Mark. A similar question on the retirement and a broad question on expenses in general. You do lay out fairly clearly on the supplemental side what your expectations are around that, and some of the earlier slides -- 5 and 8 I believe -- you laid out some of the individual expense items. But, as I look through your 10% to 12% earnings growth target, I'm trying to get a sense of why the earnings growth couldn’t actually be better in '08 and '09 given the significant ratchet down you guys might be looking for on the pension side of the equation? 
 Mark Loughridge
 Well, first of all, if you go back to my comments, pension expense is actually going to increase as we go into 2007. So again, pension expense for 2006 was $2.4 billion, and as we take the end of year interest rates and environment and we calculate that future liability, pension expense in 2007 should be slightly below $2.5 billion. So it is an increase year-to-year in pension expense of a little less than $100 million. So much less of an increase in 2007 than we have seen in the past. Nevertheless, still more expense in 2007. 
It does not really at current interest rates begin to ratchet down until we go into 2008 and 2009, and that is the point of the graphic at the end of the chart. So I think that as we go into next year, we certainly have the momentum and the structure to continue to meet our model expectations, even if you roll through the fourth quarter overachievement.

Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes - UBS. 
 Ben Reitzes - UBS 
Good afternoon, thanks. I guess a little more clarification on the guidance, Mark. Obviously you said The Street estimates look reasonable. That is 9% growth from your current 2006 of 606. So your IBM business model of 10% to 12%, the midpoint of that puts you at 673. So I was hoping you could clarify that and also talk about what kind of tax rate was implied in your guidance. 
Given that you had the R&D tax credit this quarter, do we go back to 30%? If you do think it is 9%, if you could please tell us why it would be a little below your model, that would be great. 
 Mark Loughridge
 I think my point was the growth rate in analyst estimates was reasonable and the original growth rate was about 10%. So even if you rolled through the overachievements that we saw in the fourth quarter and still maintained your 10% growth, that is a reasonable expectation. So it is above the 9% that you referenced, Ben. Is that clear? 
 Patricia Murphy
 And let me just add clarification on the tax rate for next year. As we said in the prepared remarks, Ben, that we expect the tax rate for next year to be in the range of about 28.5%. Let's go to the next question, please. 
 Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley. 
 Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley 
Good evening, thanks Mark. Just looking at cash flow from ops, you spent about 25% of that on acquisitions in '06, which is a pretty big step up from what you have been running the last couple of years. I was just curious how you're thinking about acquisition rate in '07? Does that level of investment continue, or would you characterize '07 as more of an integration year, and you might see some moderation in the rate of acquisition activity? 
 Mark Loughridge
Well, a very good question. I think what I would like to do as you look at acquisitions if you don't mind, is go back to the presentation that we made in India, and the presentation we showed in India is, we think there's a strong category of acquisition content out there that if we pick them correctly and they are highly scalable and have not yet globalized, basically IT-related, that we can rapidly scale those investments. If you remember, the IRR for those was in excess of 20%. 
So my view of that is: why wouldn't I continue to pursue that strategy? As we look at the investments that we made in acquisitions in 2006 and the performance on those investments in the fourth quarter, they are on a very, very steady track. So I think that the acquisition performance that you saw in this range of target acquisitions is a good indication of our direction as we head into 2007. 
Operator
Your next question comes from David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners. 
 David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners 
Thanks. Mark, could you go back to the expenses? I know you made some comments in your prepared remarks on slide 8. But if I understood you correctly, you said that the higher expense levels would continue in the first half of '07. So if you could maybe just help us better understand what you mean by that and the underlying drivers? 
Secondly, when we apply that 10% year-over-year growth in '07 to the base EPS, are we using the $6.11 number including the $0.06 benefit from the lower tax rate in the fourth quarter? 
 Mark Loughridge
First of all, let's start with expense. As we laid it out in the presentation, we tried to be very clear. If you look at that, the 16% expense growth adjusted for currency in last year's real estate gain, which we clearly laid out, is actually 9%. Underneath that 9%, about half of that was driven by our acquisitions, which are primarily in our software group and our GTS business. The remaining 4.5 points of growth is largely driven by investments we're making in our software and our services business in emerging markets. 
Against that organic investment, I point to the positive returns on these investments that are very encouraging. E-branded middleware is up 21%. We had 47% signings growth in our GTS business alone and our 14 emerging countries together grew 18%. So I think that is a substantial achievement given that 4.5% growth in our organic expense equation. 
I also want to step back a little bit as you look at that expense performance. I want to give you a feeling for the process that we are using here. We are being very surgical and very deliberate in our investment for 2007. 
First, our organic growth, we will continue to invest to drive our momentum in the software business, which has roughly 85% gross profit margin and performed well in the fourth quarter and throughout 2006. So we see a real increase in our momentum in that software business from our organic investments. 
Emerging countries at 21% for the year 16% constant currency, also very attractive margins as they continue to build their infrastructure. We invested to drive signings. I think the results speak for themselves, and we're investing in our channel growth like IBM.com. 
Now I will also tell you on the other side, we are working pretty hard to mitigate the impact of these investments with a tough-minded focus on spending on areas that are not clearly revenue generating, including reductions in support functions as we continue to globalize IBM in diverse centers of excellence and will continue our efforts to derive greater productivity in our operations through balancing and prioritizing resources in support of higher-yielding opportunities. 
In fact, if you just look of a microcosm of the finance organization, we have about 11,000 people currently in finance. If you look at our trajectory in globalization, by the end of 2008 we will have almost 40% of that resource in global centers of excellence. So that covers the organic investment. 
On the acquisition investment, as I said earlier, we are focused on strategic acquisitions that complement our product offerings that we can quickly integrate and accelerate through the IBM global structure. They are generally highly scalable, generally intellectual property-based and aligned with our growth opportunities. If you go back to the data that we reviewed in our analyst conference in India, you can see that of the 24 acquisitions in this strategic profile, the population almost doubled that revenue in two years, was accretive in year 2, and accretive without intangibles in year 1. So against this investment, again very tough-minded and a very disciplined approach. 
 Patricia Murphy
Thanks. Let me just clarify that the earnings per share for 2006 for continuing operations is $6.06, and that would be the base that you would apply your growth assumptions to. 
 Mark Loughridge
 Right. So to be very specific, against that $6.06, we see 2007 and the opportunity to support both our model and your estimates at 10% growth. 
 Operator
The last question will come from Keith Bachman - Banc of America Securities. 
 Keith Bachman - Banc of America Securities 
Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions, sneaking under the wire. I had a question going back to margins for a second. The Systems and Technology group margins were lower on a year-over-year basis and certainly a bit lower than we were anticipating. I was just hoping you could add a little color on that group. I wouldn’t think it would be implicated at all by any of the acquisitions you have done, so I'm not sure what is happening there. 
 Mark Loughridge
 Well, overall when you look at margins, I would look at margins in their broader scope for IBM. So first of all, if you look at IBM, the margin for '06 was up a point, and I thought that the fourth quarter, though down year-to-year, was in line with the other quarterly performance; it was predominantly down based on last year's real estate investment and the acquisitions that we have made. 
The difficult compare we saw was predominantly in GTS. GBS had spectacular margin performance as they continued to improve our utilization, contract management discipline driving 37% growth in their profitability for the year. 
Software, the software acquisitions were a real addition here to the overall performance of that unit. But if you look at the margin decline, more than two-thirds of that was driven by the acquisitions we made. S&TG margins did decline, driven largely by that same real estate deal and currency items that impacted our overall IBM margins. So actually, if you airlift those out, they did well operationally. 
 Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Keith, and I want to thank you all for joining us today. Have a good evening.

Mark Loughridge
Thanks, Patricia. We had a great quarter and our results demonstrate the balance and strength of our business model. For the quarter, we delivered $22.6 billion in revenue, which was up 5% as reported and 4% at constant currency. Our pre-tax income was up 9% to $3.2 billion, with a very solid profit margin of 14%. As reported, we delivered $1.45 of earnings per share, which was up 54% year-to-year. Excluding the one-time tax charge for the Homeland Repatriation activity from last year's results, IBM's earnings per share were up 15%. 
Our performance was very strong in many key areas. Software posted solid growth in revenue and pre-tax profit, and was the largest profit contributor. We believe our focus on building up our software capabilities is paying off. We had good results in many of our hardware brands, but our System Z performance was exceptional. Our hardware and software performance benefited from particularly good sales execution in September in closing key transactions for the quarter. 
From a geographic perspective, Asia Pacific improved significantly with a strong contribution from Japan. Productivity initiatives continue to drive higher margins and once again we had strong cash performance, with an increase in net cash from operations through September of $2 billion, excluding global financing receivables. 
Let me address what this means right upfront. Based on this performance, it is reasonable for you to roll through the $0.10 earnings per share over-achievement to your full year estimates. Given our year-to-date performance, we are on track to deliver earnings per share growth for 2006 in line with the IBM model. 
Let's get into the details, starting with revenue and gross profit by brand. Global services revenue was up 3% as reported and 2% at constant currency. The growth rate improved sequentially in both global technology services and global business services. Hardware revenue was up 9% as reported and up 8% at constant currency. 
As I mentioned, our System Z business performance was especially strong. System P and storage also posted solid growth, and microelectronics continued to benefit from a good demand for games processors. 
Software revenue was up 9% as reported and 7% at constant currency, led by good growth across our key middleware brands. For the first nine months of the year, our software revenue was up 5% as reported and 6% at constant currency, as customers leverage IBM's end-to-end middleware capabilities. Global financing revenue was down 2% and down 3% at constant currency, driven by lower levels of used equipment sales. 
Turning to gross profit margin, the year-to-year improvement resulted from a combination of improved margin from our ongoing productivity initiatives and a mix towards our higher margin businesses. 
Looking at our revenue by geography, I will focus my comments on the results at constant currency to provide the best view of the underlying business performance. The Americas revenue again increased 2% year-to-year. From a product perspective, the Americas growth was driven by software. By region, the best performance came from Latin America with double-digit revenue growth. The U.S. was also up, but Canada declined. 
Europe's revenue also increased 2% year-to-year, an improvement from the growth rate in the second quarter. Performance across the geography generally improved. Most of the major countries grew, including the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands; but Germany continued to decline. 
As I said earlier, the best performance came from Asia Pacific, with 6% revenue growth. The results reflect better execution by our team. A strong contribution to the improvement came from Japan, which declined through the first half of the year but improved to flat in the third quarter. Japan represents over half of the Asia Pacific revenue base. 
Each of the other four major regions posted double-digit growth. Across all of our geographies, the emerging countries of China, India, Brazil and Russia together grew 19%. India again posted the strongest growth, up 37%. China grew 27% and Brazil grew 13%, while Russia declined 7%. We continue to invest to build capabilities in these countries to address the fast-growing domestic market opportunities and to enhance IBM's globally integrated operations. 
Finally, our OEM growth was 24% in the third quarter, driven by strong game chip performance in our microelectronics business. 
Now, we'll move on to expense. Total expense and other income increased 8% in the quarter. Our expense to revenue ratio was 27.9%, up nine-tenths of a point year-to-year. The increase was driven by SG&A due to our ongoing investments in sales, skills, emerging markets and our strategic acquisitions. 
As in the past, to help investors understand the drivers of our operational performance, I will go through the road map of specific items that significantly impacted our profit growth. These items are reported in cost and expense. Other income benefited from a $52 million year-to-year increase to interest income, reflecting our strong cash balance and increasing interest rates. Continued work force rebalancing expense increased about $70 million year-to-year. We continued to be impacted by retirement-related plans, which again generated about $600 million of cost and expense in the quarter. This is an increase of about $70 million year-to-year. We expect these plans to cost approximately $2.4 billion for the full year, a $300 million year-over-year impact, excluding last year's one-time charges. 
Now let me comment on currency. IBM hedges its major cross-border cash flows and as a result, mitigates the effect of currency volatility in the year-over-year results. The impact of these hedging programs is principally reflected in other income and expense as well as cost of goods sold. I'm not going to predict future currency moves, but at current spot rates we would expect revenue growth to benefit from currency translation in the fourth quarter. The supplemental chart at the end of the presentation benchmarks currency's potential future impact on revenue, assuming Monday's exchange rates. 
Now let's turn to cash flow, Chart 7. Through the third quarter, we continued to have strong cash generation. This cash flow analysis chart has one primary difference from the FAS 95 format: it considers our global financing receivables as an investment to generate profit, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Year-to-date, net cash provided from operations, excluding the year-to-year change in global financing receivables, was $7.3 billion, an increase of $2 billion from last year. Excluding the significant pension funding activity in the U.S. and U.K. from both years, we generated over $1.3 billion more cash from operations year-to-year. 
Our year-to-date cash performance was driven primarily by growth in net income and continued focus on working capital and supply chain management. Let me comment on a couple of items within our investing activities. Global finance and receivables net of changes at global financing debt, generated less cash year-to-year as our strong performance in systems and software resulted in asset growth at the end of the quarter. Spending on acquisitions was down year-to-year. This activity will increase in the fourth quarter as we complete the acquisitions announced in the third quarter. 
We continue to drive very strong results to shareholders. Through the third quarter, we've returned over $7.9 billion to investors. $6.7 billion of this shareholder return was through share repurchase, consistent with our spending last year. We bought back 82 million shares. Average diluted shares are at 1.6 billion, down 4.6% from a year ago. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining at the end of September from our last board authorization. Through the third quarter, we paid out over $1.2 billion in dividends, which is an increase of about $300 million year-to-year. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash on hand was $10.9 billion. 97% of our total debt of $22 billion was driven by our global financing business, and global financing was leveraged at an appropriate 6.9:1. The remaining non-financing debt level was $722 million and debt to capital was 2%. Our balance sheet obviously remains very strong. 
So now let's turn to our businesses. I'm going to start with software, as it was our largest profit contributor this quarter. Software revenue was $4.4 billion, up 9% as reported and 7% at constant currency. Key branded middleware grew 20% year-to-year, and 18% at constant currency. We saw strong demand for our entire product portfolio, coupled with good sales execution on key transactions. We grew in all five brands with double-digit growth in WebSphere, Information Management and Tivoli and also grew in all major geographies. 
We've been investing heavily in our software business for some time, both internally and through our targeted acquisitions. Our performance during 2006 underscores that our strategy is working. Now let me give you a few examples: 
First, an increasing number of our customers have embraced the integrated software portfolio. This improves our customers' efficiency and is reflected in the number of large transactions completed this quarter. 
Second, our investments are carrying us more deeply into targeted markets. For instance, our investments in systems management, including our Micromuse acquisition, have enabled us to offer unique capabilities to our communications customers and contributed to Tivoli's strong performance. 
Finally, our advanced new technologies, such as services oriented architecture and information on demand, are resonating well with customers. These technologies also form the underpinnings of more integrated solutions, incorporating IBM software, services and hardware. 
Turning to the key brands, the WebSphere family of software grew 30% and 28% at constant currency. WebSphere provides a foundation for Web-enabled applications and is a key product set in deploying a client's services oriented architecture. In 2006, WebSphere technology has accelerated the emergence and acceptance of services oriented architecture, contributing to double-digit revenue growth in WebSphere each quarter. IBM's lead in SOA is well-recognized and we're continuing to invest to extend our leadership position. 
Information management software helps companies integrate, manage and gain value from their business information. Information management was up 12% and 10% at constant currency. Our information on demand portfolio builds value around our core database business. It enables our customers to integrate, analyze and optimize disparate information across their enterprise. These offerings grew over 50% year-to-year. 
In July, we introduced DB2 Version 9, commonly referred to as Viper. With enhanced XML and data compression technologies, this new database is a key component of our SOA and information on demand strategies, and has proven to be particularly effective in SAP installations. 
Finally, just last week, we completed the acquisition of FileNet, which will enhance our content management capabilities. 
Tivoli software, which provides robust systems management capabilities, grew 44% and 42% at constant currency. The performance in Tivoli was broad-based with greater than 35% growth in each of the three key Tivoli segments: systems management, security and storage. Earlier this month, we closed our acquisition of MRO, which offers customers the seamless integration of enterprise and IT asset management. 
Lotus software was up 8% and 7% at constant currency. Lotus provides solutions to improve the user interaction with IT data and business processes. Our Lotus Domino products benefited from continued momentum in its collaboration products and strong customer loyalty. 
Rational software, which provides customers with tools that manage the business process of software and systems development, was up 2% and 1% at constant currency. Other middleware was down 1% and down 2% at constant currency. This segment includes more mature products which provide a stable flow of revenue and profit. Operating systems were down due to improved price performance in System Z and volume declines in System I. 
Overall, our software business had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 9%, pre-tax profit growth of 15% and a 1 point improvement in pre-tax margins to 26%. With these results, we believe we gained share in WebSphere, information management and Tivoli, and held share in Lotus and Rational. We believe we gained share overall. 
I will move on to services. Global services delivered revenue of $12 billion, up 3% as reported and 2% at constant currency. Signings for services this quarter were $10.5 billion at constant currency. Our shorter-term signings were up 9% year-to-year, a significant improvement over last quarter's growth rate. We fell short of our expectations for longer-term signings, which were down 15% year-to-year. This quarter, we signed 12 deals larger than $100 million and our backlog is estimated at $109 billion. 
Now let me address each of the services businesses. Global technology services delivered revenue of $8.1 billion, up 3% as reported and 2% at constant currency. Strategic outsourcing revenue was up 6% as reported and up 4% at constant currency. Signings were down 29% year-to-year, as a number of large opportunities slipped out of the quarter. 
Revenue growth is impacted by a combination of signings over the longer term, sales within our base accounts, and contract erosion. This quarter, while signings were down, revenue growth improved due to signings growth last year and a continued focus on sales into our existing accounts. 
Business transformation outsourcing revenue was up 5% as reported and 4% at constant currency. BTO signings were up over 150% year-to-year with signings across our key offerings, including human resources, finance and accounting, procurement and supply chain. 
Integrated technology services revenue was down 2% as reported and down 3% at constant currency. Over the last few quarters, we have been implementing changes to improve the integrated technology services business, including streamlining our offerings and aligning skills to address higher growth and higher value areas. Although it has taken longer than we anticipated to show meaningful improvement, we are seeing signs of progress. This quarter, signings were up 7% year-to-year with growth in Asia Pacific and Europe. These are also the geographies where we first implemented changes in the business. 
Turning to margins, Global technology services' pre-tax margin was 9.6%, down nine-tenths of a point year-to-year and up two-tenths quarter to quarter. We are continuing to invest in sales delivery and business development skills across our entire set of offerings, as well as investing in strategic outsourcing infrastructure and BTO capabilities. These investments are designed to drive revenue growth over time. 
Global business services revenue was up 1% year-to-year, a 5 point sequential improvement in the constant currency growth rate. Shorter-term signings were up 11% year-to-year, driven by our growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific and our longer-term signings were down 22%. Global Business Services pre-tax profit was up over 40% year-to-year, and the third quarter pre-tax margin improved 2.6 points to 9.4%. 
Over the past 18 months, we have been implementing a transformation of our operations designed to improve profitability. This transformation included the restructuring actions we took last year, the deployment of global resources management tools and end-to-end optimization of our sourcing models, as well as increased focus on deal selectivity. This has yielded consistent improvement in utilization, better contract quality and increased profit margins. We have made a lot of progress on the profitability of Global Business Services and are encouraged by the improved revenue and short-term signings growth. 
At the same time, we are still driving for better top line performance. We are continuing to invest in high value-added business solutions. For example, we're enhancing our global development center capabilities in China and India to leverage our Webify acquisition and to accelerate SOA within our industry solutions. We are also increasing our business development resources to drive pipeline and revenue growth in our application management services business, and we are continuing to invest in key industry skills and solutions specialists in selected countries. 
So to wrap up global services, while our results this quarter were mixed and we need to focus on converting our pipeline into long-term signings growth, we are encouraged by the improvement in our short-term businesses and our overall profitability. 
Systems and technology revenue of $5.5 billion increased 10% year-to-year and 8% at constant currency, led by double-digit growth in System Z, storage, microelectronics and retail store solutions. System Z revenue was up 25% year to year, 22% at constant currency. MIPS grew 16% and for the first time, the installed inventory has surpassed 10 million MIPS. This continued growth is supported by strong customer demand for traditional mainframe engines as well as specialty processors for Linux and Java workloads. 
Security, energy and cooling efficiency, virtualization and SOA, together with improved economics, continue to play to the strength of system Z. These features are attracting new mainframe customers to the platform. Let me give you a couple of examples. Belarus Bank, a new System Z customer, deployed the first SAP banking installation in Russia. The solution includes the midrange Z9 with a Java specialty processor along with IBM storage and System P. 
In another example, Nationwide began earlier this year to move critical Linux applications to a Z990. By choosing System Z, Nationwide is projecting savings of $15 million over the competitor's solution of hundreds of x86 servers. In the third quarter, they added System Z capacity and shared their story as a main tent speaker at Linux World. 
System Z performance in the third quarter also reflected good sales execution and we believe we grew market share. System I had a disappointing quarter as revenue declined 22% or 23% at constant currency. This compares to a particularly strong quarter last year, where we reported 25% revenue growth. 
System P UNIX revenue grew 10% in the quarter, 8% at constant currency. In the third quarter, we completed the transition to Power 5+, sustaining the price performance and virtualization leadership position that has made IBM the number one UNIX vendor worldwide. Our refreshed high-end systems delivered significant performance advantages compared to recently announced competitive Itanium-based offerings. 
System X servers grew 4% year-to-year, 3% at constant currency, in line with industry estimates. System X Blade, the fastest-growing segment of the x86 market, grew 24% this quarter. IBM BladeCenter offers customers unique power and cooling capabilities and the flexibility to efficiently handle various workloads. In addition to our System X blades, IBM offered Power Blades and blades utilizing the cell broadband engine. IBM's total blade growth was over 30%. We believe IBM maintained its market leadership in blades. 
System storage was up 12% year-to-year and 11% at constant currency while improving margins. This grows 14% with double-digit growth in both enterprise and midrange disk. The DS 8000 accelerated to almost 30% growth as we introduced Power 5+. Tape grew 8% as we saw good market acceptance of our new tape security offerings. Together with IBM software and services, this solution provides for the effective encryption and management of large volumes of digital information. We believe we have gained share in both disk and tape this quarter. 
Microelectronics revenue growth of 29% was driven by client demand for game processor and networking components. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-to-year growth over 25%. System and technology revenue growth of 10%, together with the exceptional performance from System Z, drove segment profit growth of 13% year-to-year. Now I will wrap up. 
IBM is a unique technology company with a broad portfolio of higher-value products and capabilities. Over the last several years, we have executed a series of portfolio actions to reshape the company, including the sale of several commoditizing businesses. At the same time, we've continued to invest both internally and through acquisitions to build capabilities in higher-value areas. The result is a balanced mix of industry-leading businesses with good profit contribution from hardware, software and services. Our customers value IBM's unique ability to integrate these offerings on a global basis to meet their needs. 
In the third quarter, our pre-tax profit growth of 9% and EPS growth of 15% reflect the strength of the business model, with good contribution from our high value, high margin businesses. The largest profit contributor was our software business. This quarter, our software results once again reflect strong demand for products deploying services-oriented architectures and information on demand, as well as the value of our systems management, security and storage offerings. 
We are continuing to invest both internally and to execute a targeted acquisition strategy. In the third quarter, we announced acquisitions that will continue to build our capabilities while contributing growth in cash flow. 
In hardware, we also posted solid results, led by our System Z business and good performance in System P, storage and microelectronics. Services revenue growth improved over the last two quarters though it is still not where it needs to be; but the bigger story here is the solid profit base this business provides and our continued profit improvement. 
On a geographic dimension, Asia Pacific had the strongest performance, helped by a recovery in Japan and our ongoing investment in our emerging countries continued to yield strong growth. 
Turning to the productivity and cash elements of our model, in hardware, software and services, our margins improved. We'll continue to drive productivity initiatives as we globally integrate IBM. Our strong cash generation and balance sheet position allowed us to continue to return value to shareholders through share buyback and dividends. 
This was a strong quarter for us, reflecting solid execution and a balanced contribution across our portfolio. We are confident in our strategy and in our objective to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth over the longer term. 
Now Patricia and I will take your questions. 
 Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Before we go to the Q&A, let me comment on two items. First, we have a few supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark's prepared remarks. Second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions to allow us to take questions from more callers. Operator, please open it up for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Richard Gardner - Citigroup. 
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
Okay. Thank you very much. Mark, after last quarter, you commented that you were fairly confident you could grow bookings for the services business year-over-year in Q3. You did talk about a shortfall in long-term signings. Can you give a little bit of color on the reason for the shortfall? Was it competitive losses, was it deferrals into Q4? Then maybe in connection with that, give us your view of the services pipeline heading into the fourth quarter? 
Mark Loughridge
You bet, Richard. A very good question. First of all, I wanted to point out that we did not grow our signings this quarter because we missed our objective in the longer-term businesses. We did grow BTO, however, 150% this quarter. On the short-term basis, we certainly did meet our objectives for short-term signings in the quarter. GBS short term was up 11% and GTS was up 7%. So we made substantial progress here but now we need to keep that momentum going as we move to the fourth quarter. 
If you look back at the third quarter, we did have a very good pipeline of deals coming into the third. So I for one -- and I think the team as well -- fully expected to grow our signings. We just didn't get the deals closed in time as a number of opportunities slipped out of the quarter. We haven't lost these deals, we're still working on them. So as I look forward to the fourth quarter, including the deal that slipped out of the third, we see plenty of opportunity and should have sufficient signings growth to have a good quarter. But as always, as you know, we have to execute and get those deals closed. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Thank you. Mark, your SG&A was up about 10.5% year over year. Your R&D was up 8.6% year over year, relative to the growth rate of 5%. How do we think about that relative growth rate going forward? This quarter certainly your gross margins expanded more than enough to more than offset those improvements in OpEx. But how do we think about going forward about where you think OpEx should grow relative to revenue growth over the next several quarters? How should investors think about that? 
Mark Loughridge
Well, as you look at the third quarter, the increase was largely driven by SG&A, as you pointed out, it was up 11%. It reflected the investments that we made in the quarter, specifically strategic acquisitions in key growth areas like SOA; sales skills, particularly in our software group to help continue to drive the revenue and momentum that we have seen in this key business; our business development skills and solution design to help reaccelerate growth in our services business; as well as the investments that we have made in emerging markets like China, India, Russia and Brazil, where we again saw solid growth of 19% at constant currency in the third quarter. So we do continue to invest in research and development as well; that was up 7% to maintain the technological differentiation that supports our industry leadership. 
We also saw, I think a little more uniquely in the quarter, a $70 million increase in the year-to-year related to work force rebalancing. I look at that as just a part of our ongoing operational performance, but it was unique in the quarter. So our expense growth is clearly directed toward the substantial opportunities we see in the market. I think we are investing for growth. I will say, however, we do like to keep that growth in balance as we move forward. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs. 
Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs
Thank you. Again on the services side, with services signings having had at least two difficult and below expectations quarters this year, and the trends in certain key parts of the services business toward smaller deals, how should we be looking at services revenue growth prospects for 2007? I think connected to that, also could you tell us how much of your services bookings were renewals this quarter and also year-to-date? 
Mark Loughridge
Well first of all, if you look at the performance in the quarter, once again, I want to point out that although our revenue growth for services was not at our objective, it was certainly a big improvement as we move from the second quarter to the third quarter. A lot of that improvement was on the improvement in signings we saw in our short-term businesses. So I think as we need to continue that momentum in short-term signings, and now book some of the large deals that we see in the fourth quarter. If we put a couple of these quarters together, I think we can stabilize that business at a more attractive growth rate. 
I do want to point out though, if you look at the services business overall, we had substantial improvements in profitability, specifically with GBS, where our profit was up 41%. So our objective there is to drive for very profitable growth. We're not going to sign deals that don't contribute to the bottom line. That 41% improvement was highly driven by the operational performance in that group. So this is, for us, a real opportunity for profit growth. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns. 
Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns
Two things: as you look out at '07 and beyond, are you still comfortable with the model of mid single-digit revenue growth and low double-digit earnings growth? Is that still your target? You were asked a question about the signings a moment ago. I'm not sure you had a chance to fully answer that in terms of, can you put a number for the fourth quarter signings? Do you think it will be better than the 11.5 you did last year? 
Mark Loughridge
First of all, I'm not going to forecast a number for the fourth quarter. I think what I did say is if you look at the opportunity and pipeline, including the deals that have rolled from the third, I mean, I do believe we should have sufficient signings growth to have a good quarter in our services business. 
Now as far as the business model going forward, I mean boy, this was a very powerful quarter for us. So given the performance in the third quarter and you've got to look at year-to-date, we believe that we're well on track to deliver earnings per share growth for 2006 in line with the IBM model. 
We need to the look at this, I think, on a full-year basis now rolling through the $0.10 overachievement in the third. That now would produce growth, basing it off your estimates of 12%, that's the high end of our model of 10% to 12%. I think more than that, if you look at the longer-term performance over the last three years, our EPS has grown on a compounded basis by well over 16%. So we're quite committed to the model. I think the third quarter reemphasizes that performance and I think the long-term model is a good basis for looking forward to 2007 as well. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank. 
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank
Thanks, two questions, please. First I would like to get more color on the underlying organic growth rate in the software business and how you see that tracking over the next six to 12 months. 
Secondly, hoping to understand what kind of competitive dynamics you're seeing on the pricing side for contract signings and services? And to what extent would IBM be willing to trade off recent profitability gains to accelerate growth in long-term bookings? Thanks a lot. 
Mark Loughridge
You bet. First of all on the software side, you look at the third quarter the software business had another strong quarter; revenue growth of 9%, 7% at constant currency. Underneath that 7%, 2% came from acquisitions. So, 5% organic growth in our software business, which we are pretty encouraged by. 
I think more importantly, let's look underneath that. WebSphere family of software grew 30% and 28% at constant currency. As you all know, WebSphere provides a foundation for web-enabled applications and is a key product set in deploying a client's services oriented architecture, which is a key investment for us. 
Information management was up 12% and 10% at constant currency. Tivoli software grew 44% and 42% at constant currency. Key middleware in the third quarter, in addition, is more than half of our total software base. So I thought it was a very encouraging quarter on the software side and I think it indicates a continued momentum in that group as well. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes - UBS. 
Ben Reitzes - UBS
Good afternoon. Mark, could you talk about acquisitions, what was their impact in the quarter? With the acquisitions that are closing, what will the impact be in the fourth quarter? Maybe long-term, just on the software side, is it safe to say that 3 to 4 points of growth is still your target from acquisitions in terms of inorganic growth? 
Mark Loughridge
Well as I said earlier, the acquisition contribution to the 7 points of software growth was 2 points. If you look at that on an IBM basis, it is about a half a point. So we had pretty good organic performance in the quarter. 
As you look at the four acquisitions that we closed in the quarter, we expect them to contribute revenue contribution of about a point of growth in the fourth quarter. I would also say that we expect these acquisitions will negatively impact EPS by about $0.05 per share in the fourth, with almost half of that coming from non-cash impact of amortization of intangibles. So really, the acquisition content for us is key and directed towards investments that we're making to complement our own development expertise; highly scalable that takes advantage of our globalized platform. 
If you remember back to the data set that we reviewed in India that's also available on the web, what was engaging about that was if you look on a two-year basis, those kind of acquisitions and that kind of a template almost doubled over a two-year period. Why is that? Because they took advantage of the very logical synergy in IBM to scale quickly in a globalized platform. So from a CFO perspective, I have got to step back and say, why wouldn't I invest in those kinds of acquisitions to complement our own organic performance? 
Operator
Your next question comes from Bill Shope – JP Morgan. 
Bill Shope - JP Morgan
Last quarter you said you were supply constrained on I and X series servers. Were you able to resolve these supply constraints this quarter and presumably work down backlog? Also on the mainframe side of the equation, can you give us a read on the mix in your mainframe business between specialty MIPS and traditional workload this quarter? 
Mark Loughridge
First of all, let me talk about supply chain. Supply chain did a superb job as they delivered against Z, IP and storage. We did have some issues on both channel management and supply chain in our X series and we need to do better as we move into the fourth quarter. But supply chain on balance across the other parts of our business could not have performed any better. 
As far as Z series performance, I think the more significant aspect of that was the closing rate that our Z series performance got from other attributes within the sale. So FICON, memory, elements of collaboration for that platform were also very, very strong. So we had really good revenue growth on a base of MIPS growth of 16%. 
Operator
Your next question comes from Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch. 
Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch
Thanks. Mark, I wonder if you might be willing to separate some of the sales execution improvements you talked about from the general demand environment? In other words, how much of the better than expected revenue performance was attributable to your own execution versus what you would attribute to a general pickup in demand? 
I guess within each of those -- execution and demand -- how sustainable do you think that is going forward? In other words, the better execution, how much of that was catch-up from some deals that slipped in the earlier periods versus how much of that is sustainable? The same thing with the general demand environment. 
Mark Loughridge
Good question. Let me first start from an economic perspective. I think really leading economic indicators suggest the continuing moderate expansion in the global economy. So closing out the year we expect to see more global growth convergence with a modest acceleration in economic activity. So frankly, when I look at this quarter, this quarter is based on very solid execution across our services platform and some very specific geographies like Japan. We had very solid hardware performance. We had a continuing momentum in our software organizations. 
Interestingly, compared to the second quarter, this quarter had particularly good sales execution in September in closing key hardware and software transactions for the quarter. You know these transaction signings can fall on either side of the quarter end point and you need to look at more than a 90-day horizon. But really in this quarter, we had 4% constant currency growth, 3% on a year-to-date basis, so I think it was pretty balanced. 
In the quarter we were clearly able to leverage our high-value, high margin businesses to drive solid earnings per share and cash growth. So I think on balance, when you look at the third quarter, we really have got to peg this to strong execution of our teams. 
Operator
Your next question comes from David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners. 
David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners
Thanks. Mark, it looks like you had scope enhancements in the IGS backlog for the first time, in it looks like over two years. If that math is correct, could you help us understand what fundamentally is going on and how that may impact the IGS growth rate in '07 vis-a-vis the potential for long-term bookings to perhaps be a book-to-bill of less than 1 in 2006? 
Mark Loughridge
Well I think we had a very low-level of erosion as you look at our performance in the quarter. If you look on a book-to-bill basis, GBS was more heavily weighted to short-term bookings and was above 1; while GTS, driven by longer-term, was below. 
Keep in mind that there are a number of factors that go into revenue growth beyond book-to-bill. The yield you get from these signings, the yield you get from the existing base of contracts, and the impacts from erosion. So I think the key factors you look at this quarter, we had a very modest level of erosion in the third. 
Operator
Your final question comes from Keith Bachman - Banc of America. 
Keith Bachman - Banc of America Securities
Hi, just made it in under the wire. I have two if I could. The first one is, if you could talk about the bookings duration and annualized bookings, up or down if you factor in duration? 
The second one, I wanted to see if you could just return to services and go back to integrated tech services specifically and understand -- that number has been bumping around a little bit, but the performance still has been pretty weak. What does it take to turn that number into a positive year-over-year growth rate? Thanks. 
Mark Loughridge
Well you know on contract duration, I think if you look at our longer-term contracts, we're not seeing necessarily that duration shorten materially. But what we are seeing and you can kind of see it in the dynamics of our business, we're getting a bigger mix of our short-term business, because we're growing more rapidly there. So on a total basis, we are seeing more rapid growth in our short-term businesses, though if you look specifically at the long-term content, that deal length is relatively stable. 
On the second element, if you translate and look at the transition we have spoken about, it is taking somewhat longer than we anticipated in ITS as we have rolled out the higher value-add offerings. With these offerings, we have to go through an awful lot of training of our sales team. The deals have a longer sales cycles, there are other issues. 
But I think as I looked at it, I was quite encouraged by the signings growth that we had in ITS. It was up 7%. So if you want a real leading indicator of where that business is going, let's look at signings. Underneath that 7% signings growth, more importantly, much of that improvement came from the geographies where we implemented these changes first. So I think it's a real affirmation of the strategy that that services team is pulling off. Again, as I looked at it, I saw some very encouraging signs in our ITS business.

Thanks, Patricia. For the second quarter, as reported, we delivered $21.9 billion in revenue, which was down 2% as reported and at constant currency. Without PC’s in 2005, IBM revenue was up 1%. Our pre-tax income was $2.9 billion, up 6% over second quarter of last year, and we delivered $1.30 of earnings per share, which was a 14% improvement over last year’s second quarter. 
In 2005 we had three non-recurring items in the reported results. When you exclude the non-recurring charges from last year’s results, IBM’s pre-tax income was up 11%, and earnings per share were up 16%. In addition, we concluded the sale of our PC business to Lenovo in the second quarter of 2005, and last year’s results include one month of activity. 
On a comparable basis, without the now-divested PC business: 
We saw sales and contract cycles elongate in June. In that environment, we still delivered double-digit earnings per share growth. While some areas of our business did well, others leave room for improvement. 
We were pleased with our performance in many areas: 
But in other areas, we certainly have opportunities for improvement. 
In servers, execution issues in our supply chain left some orders unfulfilled and we continued to work through product transitions in the midrange. 
In services, our short-term businesses were weak. I’ve mentioned the last few quarters that our Integrated Technology Services business has been in transition, and we have rebalanced the portfolio to streamline offerings and focus on higher value and higher growth segments. We remain confident in the actions we have taken, but the transition is taking longer than anticipated. 
In Global Business Services, though our business grew in the Americas, we under-performed in some key countries in Europe and Asia. Overall, our performance once again reflected the ability to leverage productivity initiatives to generate solid earnings per share and cash growth. 
Let’s move on to revenue and gross profit by brand. 
Global Services revenue was down 1% year-to-year. The revenue decline was driven primarily by our short-term businesses, while Strategic Outsourcing and BTO increased year-to-year. 
Hardware revenue was down 7% as reported. Without the PC business in our 2005 results, hardware was up 3% and up 2% at constant currency. Our hardware results were mixed by brand, with good performance in System z and microelectronics, offset by declines in the midrange servers and storage. 
Software revenue was up 5%. This performance was led by good growth in our key middleware brands. 
Global Financing revenue was down 7%, driven by a decline in the asset base and a lower level of used equipment sales. 
I will comment briefly on gross margin before we get into revenue by geography. Our gross profit margin for the quarter was 41.2%, up 1.8 points year-to-year. The divestment of the low margin PC business contributed 1.2 points of that improvement. Global Services margin improved due primarily to benefits from our productivity initiatives, while our Hardware margin without PC’s declined. 
Turning to revenue by geography, I will focus my comments on the results without PC’s at constant currency, to provide the best view of our ongoing geographic performance. 
The Americas revenue increased 2% year-to-year, supported by growth in all regions. Growth was led by software, offset by declines in mid-range servers and storage. 
Europe revenue declined 1%. As always, results were mixed by country. France and Spain again showed solid growth but Germany, Italy and the UK declined. 
Asia Pacific revenue declined 3% this quarter. Representing over half of the Asia Pacific revenue base, Japan declined, as we continue to work through our operating issues. 
China was down this quarter. We had a strong quarter last year, due to large System z-based banking transactions. 
Partially offsetting these declines, the ASEAN region again had double-digit growth, led by India, and Korea posted strong results. 
The emerging countries of China, India, Brazil and Russia together grew 13% as reported and 7% at constant currency, without PC’s. India again posted the strongest growth, up 45% at constant currency. Brazil grew 4% and Russia 19%, while China declined 3% off a difficult compare. We continue to expand our capabilities in these countries, as you hopefully got a chance to see at our analyst meeting in June or from the materials on our investor website. 
Finally, our OEM growth was 34% in the second quarter, driven by strong game chip performance in our microelectronics business. 
Now we will move on to expense. 
Total Expense and Other Income increased 1% in the second quarter. Our expense to revenue ratio was 28%, up almost a point year-to-year as reported, but flat as compared to 2005 expense-to-revenue without both the non-recurring items and PC results. 
As in the past, to help investors understand the drivers of our operational performance, I will highlight those items that significantly impacted our profit growth. These items are reported in cost and expense. 
In the second quarter, we had a couple of items that significantly helped our profit growth. We continued to benefit from our second quarter 2005 productivity initiatives, which were implemented beginning in the second quarter of last year. As the year-to-year benefit begins to wrap in the third quarter, we will continue to drive productivity as we globally integrate IBM. Additionally, these actions make us more competitive and give us more pricing flexibility. 
Total equity compensation was down $54 million year-to-year excluding the impact of last year’s non-recurring items, due primarily to lower grants over the last few years. 
Other Income benefited from a $74 million year-to-year increase to interest income, reflecting our strong cash balance and increasing interest rates. 
Turning to the items that hurt our year-to-year profit growth, retirement-related plans – both pension and retiree medical, generated over $600 million of cost and expense in the quarter. This is up almost $100 million excluding the impact of last year’s non-recurring items. We continue to expect these plans to cost us between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion for the full year, a $200 to $300 million year-over-year impact, excluding last year’s one-time charges. 
In the quarter, Intellectual Property Income was down also about $100 million year-to-year. 
Before moving on to cash flow performance, let me comment on currency. IBM hedges its major cross-border cash flows and, as a result, mitigates the effect of currency volatility in the year-over-year results. The impact of these hedging programs is principally reflected in Other Income and Expense, as well as cost of goods sold. This quarter, there was very little impact in the current period from our hedging programs. However, due to losses incurred last year, the activity results in a year-to-year improvement in Other Income and Expense of approximately $100 million. 
I am not going to predict future currency moves but at current spot rates, we would expect revenue growth to benefit from currency translation in the second half. The supplemental chart at the end of the presentation benchmarks currency’s potential future impact on revenue, assuming Monday’s exchange rates. 
Now let’s turn to Cash Flow, chart 7. For the first half of the year, we continued to have strong cash generation. Our cash from operations excluding Global Financing receivables was principally driven by our earnings and accounts receivable performance. This cash flow analysis chart has one primary difference from the FAS 95 format. It considers our Global Financing receivables as an investment to generate profit, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. 
For the first half, Net Cash Provided from Operations, excluding the year-to-year change in Global Financing receivables, was $2.9 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion from last year. Excluding the significant pension funding activity in the U.S. and U.K from both years, we generated over $700 million more cash from operations year-to-year. 
Our first half cash performance was driven primarily by growth in net income, and continued focus on working capital and supply chain management. Within working capital, receivable collections were strong. 
Our use of cash for investments was fairly consistent with last year’s activity, with the exception of approximately $500 million of net proceeds received from the sale of our PC business to Lenovo in 2005. 
We continue to drive very strong returns to shareholders. In the first half of 2006, we returned over $5.8 billion to investors -- $5.1 billion of this shareholder return was through share repurchase. We bought back 62.7 million shares, and average diluted shares were at 1.6 billion, down 4.3% from a year ago. We have approximately $3.9 billion remaining at the end of June from our last Board authorization. 
This quarter we announced a 50% increase to our dividend rate, the largest increase in our history. With this increase, in the first half we paid out over $750 million in dividends to shareholders. 
Turning to the balance sheet, our cash on hand was $10 billion. Ninety-eight percent of our total debt of $21.8 billion was driven by our Global Financing business, and Global Financing was leveraged at an appropriate 6.9 to 1. The remaining non-financing debt level was less than $500 million and debt-to-capital was 2%. Our balance sheet remains strong. 
So now let’s turn to our businesses, starting with Global Services. Global Services delivered revenue of $11.9 billion, down 1% year to year. 
Signings for services this quarter were $9.6 billion at constant currency, down 34% against a very challenging compare. This quarter we signed 11 deals larger than $100 million, and our backlog is estimated at $109 billion. Looking at our signings for the quarter, it is important to remember that we are comparing to signings of $14.6 billion in the second quarter last year, which was the largest quarterly signings since the fourth quarter of 2003. Although long-term signings tend to be uneven, and our short-term signings were up slightly quarter-to-quarter, the performance fell short of our expectations. 
Let me get into each of these services businesses. 
Global Technology Services delivered revenue of $8 billion, up 1% year to year. 
 For the segment, longer-term signings were down 52% year-to-year, and shorter-term signings were down 10%. 
Strategic Outsourcing revenue was up 3% year-to-year. 
The improved revenue growth rate for Strategic Outsourcing was driven by signings over the last five quarters. We are also seeing good growth in our existing accounts, which reflects customers’ satisfaction with our service delivery. Strategic Outsourcing signings were down 46% this quarter, compared to a very strong second quarter last year. As you know, longer-term signings can be uneven over the course of the year. 
Business Transformation Outsourcing revenue was up 15% as reported, and up 16% at constant currency. BTO revenue continued to grow in all geographies. Growth this quarter was impacted by a contract renegotiation which will continue to impact BTO revenue through the remainder of the year. BTO signings were down 73% year-to-year. Like Strategic Outsourcing, BTO engagements are longer-term, and so signings tend to be uneven over the course of the year. 
Integrated Technology Services revenue was down 5% year to year. I’ve talked to you about the steps we have taken to improve the Integrated Technology Services business, including increased business development and sales skills and streamlining our offerings to address higher growth and higher value areas. While it is taking longer to get traction in our results, we continue to believe we have implemented the right actions, and we expect them to show results over the longer term. 
Turning to margin, Global Technology Services pre-tax margin was 9.4%, an improvement of 1.1 points year-to-year, excluding the incremental restructuring charges from last year. The majority of this improvement came from last year’s productivity initiatives. 
Global Business Services delivered $3.9 billion of revenue, declining 5% as reported, and 4% at constant currency. 
Revenue performance this quarter was mixed. We continued to see growth in the Americas, which represents roughly 40% of the portfolio. This was offset by declines in Japan, Germany and Italy, which combined represent over a quarter of our business. We were also impacted by a decline in our Federal business as we adjust to changing dynamics in U.S. government spending. 
For the segment, shorter-term signings were down 5% year-to-year, and longer-term signings were down 42%. Within Global Business Services, and in fact across all of our services areas, we continue to take a disciplined approach to bidding on contracts. The deal fundamentals and value proposition need to make sense for both us and the customer. 
We are driving actions to improve performance within Global Business Services. For example: 
Turning to margin, Global Business Services pre-tax margin was 9.5%, an improvement of .8 points year-to-year, after adjusting for last year’s incremental restructuring charge. This improvement in margin was primarily driven by our productivity initiatives, offset by revenue weakness in the short-term businesses. We continue to see stable to improving margins in our new business. 
So to wrap up Global Services: 
Now I’ll move on to Systems and Technology, chart 10. Systems and Technology revenue grew 3% year-to-year, led by growth in our System z, Microelectronics and Retail Store Solutions business units. 
Gross profit margin improved sequentially as our profit management actions gain traction, but is down year-to-year due to hardware mix driven by the strong growth in our microelectronics business; product and geography mix in our System z mainframes, and pricing pressures in our mid-range and low end servers. 
We were unable to ship to meet all of our customer demand, which impacted our server brands, most notably Systems i and x. Our unusually high level of unfilled orders were due to end-to-end supply chain complexities which were primarily driven by parts and product transitions to support the RoHS -- Removal of Hazardous Materials -- requirement in Europe. This limited our manufacturing and sourcing flexibility. 
System z revenue grew 7% year-to-year as reported and 6% at constant currency, fueled by double-digit growth in the Americas and Europe. MIPS growth of 7% reflects continued customer acceptance of both specialty engines and traditional mainframe workloads. The announcement and general availability of our new mid-range z9 was also well-received by the marketplace and accounted for approximately 15% of the MIPS shipped this quarter. 
Nexxar, a financial transaction processing company, chose the new System z Business Class for its high availability, security, reliability, and flexibility to allow for future business growth. This strategic win in the SMB environment demonstrates IBM’s capabilities to provide customers with end-to-end solutions. 
System i revenue declined 7%, improving from the first quarter but not yet where we want it to be. As I mentioned earlier, we were unable to fulfill all of the demand for System i. If we had been able to ship to our more typical level of pending orders, our year-to-year revenue would have been about flat. 
High end volumes improved as expected as the transition to our new products announced in the first quarter completed, with strong year-to-year growth in our flagship 595 model. 
System p UNIX servers declined 10% in the quarter, 11% at constant currency. 
While volumes were up year-to-year, a mix shift in our high end ahead of the third quarter refresh contributed to the revenue decline. This also reflects a difficult compare to last year’s growth of 36%. 
In the third quarter, we will complete the transition to Power 5+ and expand the implementation of our Power Quadcore technology to all entry level System p products. These upcoming announcements will sustain the price/performance and virtualization leadership position that has made IBM the No. 1 UNIX vendor worldwide. 
Revenue for System x servers was flat year-to-year. We were not able to fulfill all of the demand. If we had been able to ship to our more typical level of pending orders, our year-to-year System x server revenue would have been up about 6%. 
Despite the shipment limitations, our server volumes had double-digit growth year-to-year. Blade growth remained strong in the quarter with both volumes and revenue growth of over 35%. System Storage declined 2% year-to-year, 3% at constant currency. 
Disk declined 1% -- however, we believe we held share in disk, led by midrange growth of over 15%. While the high-end declined, our current generation high-end offering, the DS8000 family of products, grew 10% year-to-year. Tape declined 4%. 
Microelectronics revenue grew 45% year-to-year, driven by continued strong demand in the games processor business. 
Let’s move on to Software. Software revenue was up 5% year-to-year to $4.2 billion. This growth was driven by our key middleware portfolio and strong performance in Product Lifecycle Management. Operating systems and other middleware declined. 
In the second quarter, key branded middleware grew 9%. There was solid growth across all key brands and both WebSphere and Tivoli grew at double digits. In a very competitive software market, we had constant currency growth in all major geographies with particular strength in the Americas and Europe. 
The WebSphere family of software grew 17% as reported and 18% at constant currency. We continue to be the market leader in Services Oriented Architecture products. SOA-related products are in strong demand as evidenced by double-digit growth in WebSphere business integration and application server software. We believe we gained share for the quarter. 
Information Management software grew 6% as reported and was up 7% at constant currency. In 2005, we announced a major initiative called “Information on Demand,” which includes higher order products designed to integrate information to its most useful form. Our Information on Demand product set continues to be well-accepted in the marketplace. Revenue nearly doubled to over $100 million in the second quarter. We believe we held share for the quarter. 
Lotus software grew 6% as reported and at constant currency. Our Domino products grew in a highly competitive market. We believe we held share for the quarter. 
Tivoli software grew 12% as reported and at constant currency. Our Tivoli software continues to take share in a very competitive marketplace. The combination of internal development and strategic acquisitions is paying off, particularly in our systems management segment. The Micromuse acquisition, completed in February, is another good example of our ability to quickly integrate and globally leverage acquired capabilities into the business. We believe Tivoli gained share for the quarter. 
Rational software was up 8% as reported and at constant currency. In the second quarter, Rational delivered solid growth across all geographies as customers continue to demand software development tools based on open standards. We believe Rational gained share for the quarter. 
Other Middleware was down 3% as reported and at constant currency. This segment includes more mature products which provide a stable base of revenue, profit and cash. 
The strong performance in Other Software/Services was driven by solid growth in our Product Lifecycle Management portfolio of products. PLM helps companies improve their product development processes and their ability to use product-related information across their business. In the second quarter, we closed a number of large deals resulting in double-digit growth in all geographies. 
Operating Systems software declined 6% as reported and 5% at constant currency. Operating Systems are closely tied to our server products and provide a sound, cost-effective platform for our middleware and business solutions. 
Overall, our software business had another solid quarter. We believe we gained share in Key Branded Middleware and Product Lifecycle Management. This revenue growth drove strong bottom line results as well. The Software pre-tax margin of 24% is up 2 points year-to-year, after adjusting for the incremental restructuring charge in second quarter of last year. 
Now, I’ll wrap up. 
IBM’s business model has two dimensions. One is a portfolio of businesses, hardware, software and services, that provide us with the ability to offer customers both industry-leading point products as well as innovative end-to-end solutions to address our customers’ most pressing business needs. 
This quarter, while our hardware and services businesses didn’t perform to our expectations, we had solid software performance led by our key branded middleware products, especially WebSphere and Tivoli. 
Our software results reflect strong demand for products deploying Services Oriented Architectures, and the value of our systems management, security, and storage offerings. These results also reflect the positive impact of our targeted acquisition strategy which strengthens our capabilities while contributing profitable growth and ongoing cash performance. 
The second dimension of our model is the ability to drive earnings per share growth through a combination of revenue growth, productivity and effective use of cash. 
Our productivity initiatives, including the restructuring action implemented last year, continued to yield good margin results again this quarter. We will continue to drive productivity initiatives as we globally integrate IBM. Though the year-to-year benefit will not be as great going forward, the competitive cost structure and increased pricing flexibility are now embedded in our business model. 
We also continued our strong cash generation and returned some of that cash to shareholders through dividends and share buyback, which further contributed to earnings per share growth. 
The strength and breadth of the IBM model comes from being able to leverage across these two dimensions, our broad portfolio and our strong financial position, to consistently deliver solid earnings and cash performance. 
Given our first half performance, we are on track to deliver earnings per share growth for 2006 in line with the IBM model. This is consistent with the average of your estimates for the year. 
Now, Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, let me comment on two items. First, we have a few supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark’s prepared remarks. Second, I would ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. This will allow us to take questions from more callers. 
Okay, Operator, let’s open it up for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. 
(Operator Instructions) 
Our first question comes from Richard Farmer with Merrill Lynch. You may begin. 
Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Mark, I would like to ask a question about the demand environment. You mentioned the elongated sales cycles in June. There is a lot of debate among investors as to whether demands, broadly speaking, is starting to rollover in some of the important end markets right now, particularly given some of the pre-announcements at companies like AMC and SAP. So given your very broad view of demand at IBM over many of the segments in the market, what is your feeling about the environment right now? Do you think it is essentially stable, or do you think on a margin demand is getting a little softer? Any differentiation you might be willing to provide between the end markets like servers, storage, services, etc. would be very helpful. Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge
Sure, Richard. Let me first give you a description as we went through the quarter. I would say, as I pointed out in the script, a number of transactions around the world, we have seen that the sales cycle for enterprise clients appears to have lengthened, as customers have increased the level of scrutiny and approvals on their transactions. So we saw that most distinctly as we closed out the quarter in the third month. 
I would say underneath this, however, we have seen a relative divergence in our performance in the enterprise versus SMB space. While growth in our SMB customers has remained generally solid, growth in enterprise space slowed again due to lengthening of transaction closure at the end of the quarter. 
As you know, we have managed through these kinds of cycles before, and we will continue to drive productivity initiatives to leverage our overall performance. At the same time, as we see strategic opportunities, we will move aggressively, consistent with the model that we discussed in India. 
So I guess, Richard, I would conclude by saying there is really no definitive indicator that this is a trend, but I would say the breadth of our portfolio, the strength of our financial model, and our strong market leadership positions us well as we move into the third quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Richard. Let’s go to the next question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Laura Conigliaro with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. 
Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs
Yes, on the services side, your services signings are now down in the mid-teens for the first half of ’06 versus ’05, and your second half signings would need to be up probably in the mid- to high-teens just to actually be flat with last year. Is this even plausible and what kind of services growth can you actually drive on the revenue side in ’07 if signings do end up flat, or maybe even slightly down? 
Mark Loughridge
Okay, Laura, let me -- I think first of all I would like to go through the data with you, so we can lay a foundation for the answer to this question. First of all, if you look at ’05, the long-term signings were up 19% in the first quarter. Long-term was up 20%. As we entered the second quarter, as we closed it out again affected by a lengthening contract cycle, our long-term signings were down. Again, I would reemphasize that that was against a very powerful second quarter 2005 and we did greater than $9 billion of long-term signings last year. 
So I would put the long-term performance in the context of that longer time frame -- 2005 long-term at 19%, first quarter long-term up 20% and really, short-term contracts, if you look at the half, were down 2%, so I would say that is, on a rough comparable basis, that we go into the second half roughly even on a year-to-year basis. 
Now, I would also emphasize that as we have discussed before, longer term signings tend to be lumpy. They are a little more unpredictable and they do not occur smoothly quarter by quarter throughout a year. They can be uneven. Even in short-term signings, while down year to year, they were up on a sequential basis. 
Regardless, I certainly have to admit that signings performance did not meet our expectation and we are driving the actions required to improve our execution and our results as we enter the second half of the year. 
As we look at that pipeline going into the second half of the year, we do have a strong deal list. The pipeline is up year to year. The pipeline went up quarter to quarter but I think it is more the context of the individual deals that is more encouraging. A strong deal list which should enable us to grow our signings in the third quarter. Now, or course, we have to execute to do that but clearly there is enough opportunity. We just need to get it signed. 
But we are going to continue to be selective to drive our profitability. We are not going to sign bad deals. We do have the discipline to walk from a bad deal. As we just looked, the opportunity, the deal list and the progression of that deal list and where we stand with those individual clients, we feel relatively confident that as we go into the third quarter, we should see signage growth on a year-to-year basis. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Laura. Let’s go to the next question. 
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Bill Shope with JP Morgan. You may begin. 
Bill Shope - JP Morgan
Great, thanks. Looking at your signings performance as well, given this quarter’s performance and given the decline in short-term signings, I think you had set a target several quarters ago for mid-single-digit growth in the services segment for the second half of the year. Can you still achieve that number, given the signings performance we have seen thus far? 
Mark Loughridge
Well, I mean, we clearly did not meet our signings expectation this quarter. As you know, revenue performance trails signings performance, so as we look at the third quarter, as I said earlier, our pipeline is up year to year and quarter to quarter. More importantly, look at the quality of that deal list and the progression of the deals, we should be able to return to signage growth in the third quarter. 
Of course, we need to execute on that deal list. We are all committed to growing the signings in the third quarter. If you look at the INE, obviously revenue in the INE will follow signings going forward but first job is get the signings growth back on track next quarter, and we feel confident that we will see growth in the quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Bill. Let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Richard Gardner with Citigroup. You may begin. 
Richard Gardner - Citigroup
Thank you very much. Mark, I was hoping that you might be able to provide some detail on the mainframe mix in the quarter. Obviously last quarter you had an unusually high mix of Java and Linux workloads and I believe it was about 35% of the MIPS shipped in the quarter. What did that do in the current quarter? Did you see a return to more traditional workload? Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge
Yes, if you look at our V series performance, specialty engine MIPS represented approximately 21% of total MIPS shipped in the second quarter versus 16% in the second quarter of ’05 and 38% in the first quarter of ’06, so we experienced 36% year to year growth in specialty engine MIPS in the second quarter, and as we had laid out in the first quarter call, this resulted in a much improved MIPS, especially to traditional MIPS compared to the first quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Richard. Let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes in from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. 
Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities
Thank you. Good afternoon. There has been some talk in the marketplace about increasing pricing pressure in the services industry in general. Can you comment on current pricing that you see out there for the deals, both on large and small deals? Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge
I think if you looked at services, I would break that pricing question down as follows -- I think ITS price pressure remains fairly stable. There is increased price pressure in the BTO area. Consulting prices are stable to improving. I think you saw that in our margin performance as well. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Chris. Let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes is from Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may begin. 
Tony Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein
Yes, thank you. You alluded in your earnings release to your $10 billion cash balance creating “opportunities”. When you allude to opportunities, are you implicitly referring to acquisitions? Can you clarify your historical preference in the unwritten rules of effectively than to do smaller acquisitions, less than $5 billion in revenue I would say is a rough guidepost, and also not to do dilutive acquisitions? Can you comment on whether those are ultimately aspirations or constraints on potential acquisitions going forward? 
Mark Loughridge
Well, that is a very good question. I think what I do in answering that, Tony, is we would look at the data that we presented in India. We looked at a profile of acquisitions that we did from 2002 to 2004, and we looked at acquisitions that were in the $500 million to $700 million at the high end and down as well. If you looked at those 24 acquisitions, and that is all of the acquisitions 500 and below, for that period, you looked at the revenue growth that resulted from the pre-acquisition year, over the next two years that profile really almost doubled. It was generally accretive in the second year. If you took out the amortization of intangibles, you would see cash benefit very quickly. 
I think we would also point out that a number of these acquisitions were accretive even in the quarter that we acquired it -- the Micromuse, that was accretive in the quarter we acquired it. Candle was accretive in the quarter we acquired it. 
So as we concluded on that data that we presented, we drew some conclusions. One, that is we buy capability that enhances our own capability, it is really the ability to now globalize that across IBM, to scale it rapidly across the IBM business structure that pays off in that business case. 
Now, I do not want to say that we would never do a large acquisition. If it was appropriate for us or if it drew a strategic capability and enhanced the overall shareholder position, but what I do want to say is that for acquisitions and that kind of a category, that is now a more operational part of our performance and we include that as part of even our pipeline view of opportunities, especially in areas that scale rapidly like software, like intellectual property. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Tony. Let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes is from Keith Bachman with Banc of America. You may begin. 
Keith Bachman - Banc of America
Thank you. I wanted to, Mark, see if you could talk a little bit about the hardware margins as a category. How should we be thinking about this going forward? What are the key drivers? If you could speak to that, including MIPS? Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge
First of all, if you look at overall margins, we improved from first quarter to second quarter at bottom-line profitability, and that provides us momentum as we go from the second to the third. 
Moving forward into the third, our hardware profitability should improve from the second quarter for a number of reasons, which I will list. The first, the transition to RoHS is now behind us, which reduces the complexity that impacted us in the second quarter. The server transition to Power 5+, which impacted some of our mix in the second quarter, will complete in the third quarter. We believe we can continue our strong momentum in Blades. We are the leader in this fast-growing space. We continue to see excellent adoption of storage virtualization. 
So if you put all of that together, along with the actions that we put in place to lower our end-to-end cost, we feel pretty confident that we should see that momentum and profitability for our hardware businesses continue as we go into the third quarter. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Keith. Let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes is from Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns. You may begin. 
Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns
If I could, just going back to your comments about the outlook for the year and you talk about your comfort, how comfortable can you be, given the signs of slowing in the services, given the comments you made about what is going on in terms of the sales cycle? What gives you that level of comfort? We are only half-way through the year and you have seen lots of things go in the other direction. Why are you so comfortable at this level, Mark? 
Mark Loughridge
Well, you know, if you look at it, I would go down to the deal base. We did not see those deals leave the opportunity set. We did not see those deals -- we did not lose them to competition, but they did generally roll. As we have looked at the progression of those deals in the third quarter, they seem to be continuing on a very logical pace. So to us, as we just look at the engagement detail that we have, it looks like that lengthening contract cycle has rolled those deals into the third quarter but those deals and progression of those deals is still continuing. 
I would say that the backdrop I would apply to this though is relatively the SMB space seems to be performing and driving at a fairly constant rate, and we did not necessarily see this same impact of lengthening contracts that we saw in enterprise. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Andy. Let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes is from Ben Reitzes with UBS. You may begin. 
Ben Reitzes - UBS
Thank you. With regard to services again, Mark, could you talk about how -- in the past, you talked about duration, you’ve talked about other aspects of the contracts and you have gotten pretty detailed in the past to just give us a handle on I guess your handle on how you are going to hit these estimates based on the contract profile you see. If you could you just give us a little more detail on some of the commentary you provided in the past with regard to duration and maybe the contract profile. I know you have answered it, and obviously if you could give us just a little more detail on what gives you confidence that you can keep the services margins up, given the bookings trend, and short-term in particular and what you see. Thank you. 
Mark Loughridge
First of all, if you are looking at services margin, number one, we have a very disciplined process. So we are not going to chase bad deals that would erode our overall position. Number two, I think we have a very strong cost base. We established that with some of the restructuring work but that better base of cost extends well into the second half of the year, as well as continuing the actions that we have to constantly drive productivity, not only in our services businesses but across the IBM platform as well. 
I will say that as we go into the quarter, we also have very specific action plans for both GTS and GBS. In ITS, we are developing new offerings in the higher value-add market opportunities. Examples like security and privacy services, business continuity and resiliency services, storage and data services. We are developing new offerings within these areas that is well underway, as well as training our sales reps to sell to the value in those offerings -- all of those should promote not only deal growth and volume growth but also profitability. 
Likewise in GBS, we are driving specific action plans to ramp up and invest on our high value of services, adding incremental industry resources, subject matter experts, and solutions specialists to drive this improved value base in our offerings. 
In application management services, we are adding sales in key delivery resources, expanding our geographic delivery footprint. In support of these high-growth plays, we implemented the Global Business Solution Centre in India to create and enhance our portfolio of industry solutions. 
So all of these actions across the ITS elements and the GTS elements, as well as GBS, are intended to drive continued -- recovering our signings base but also a very positive cost base and driving towards that value, higher-margin space. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Ben. Let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes is from Rebecca Runkle with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. 
Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley
Good afternoon, Mark. Just a quick clarification on public sector, which is your second-largest vertical, I believe, and was down about 6% year on year. Take that and combine that with your comments about changing vertical dynamics related to services, and I’m just wondering -- how cautious should we be about public sectors outlook in the second half? Any commentary or meat you could put around what you are seeing there? How you are adjusting your second half expectations would be helpful. 
Mark Loughridge
If you look at public sector, I think within that, the point that we are making is there has been, at least for us, a shift in the spending within the government to fund certain defense efforts. BBS has elected not to participate in military department defense spend relating to mission systems and weapons systems. So given this, we have experienced a downturn in U.S. federal revenue over the past 6 quarters. Now, we continue to focus on our value propositions and the agency spend that we have targeted, and we had improved signings over the last couple of quarters. Given that our federal contracts are longer-term in nature, it takes some time for revenue ramp to occur, so I think that is the most significant aspect of the public sector that I would point out. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Rebecca. Operator, let’s take one last question, please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our last question is from David Grossman with Thomas Weisel Partners. You may begin. 
David Grossman - Thomas Weisel Partners
Thank you. Mark, typically software in periods of slowing demand has a tendency to lead services. Based on your current results, at least, it seems that almost the reverse is happening at IBM. I am wondering if you could perhaps help us better understand why we are seeing the software continue to perform, despite what you suggest is some slowing enterprise demand that may be impacting services. 
Mark Loughridge
A very good point. As we look at our software performance in the second quarter, it comes off the back of a very positive performance in the first quarter as well. What I find most powerful about our software performance is that it was very consistent across all geographies, so we grew software in all geographies, and at constant currency. We gained share in Europe and held share in the Americas and Asia. 
This is in our base performance. We had WebSphere up 18%. Information management, our database content, up 7%. Lotus up 6%, Tivoli up 12%, our Rational up 8%. So in aggregate in the second quarter, branded middleware grew 9% as reported and at constant currency. So we believe we have gained share in branded middleware and specifically in the WebSphere, Tivoli and Rational brands. 
Now, behind that, we have been investing heavily in our key middleware brands, both internal development that has generated strong products which add organic growth. These products include SOA related WebSphere products, Information on Demand products, and Tivoli Storage Management. We have invested heavily in our sales and marketing investments, allowing us to capture a bigger share of the market. We have augmented our internal development with synergistic acquisitions -- for instance, Micromuse that I pointed out earlier, which adds new leading systems management capabilities. 
So all of this together I think highlights our capability in software but also as a function of a well-laid out set of investments that has now achieved very positive results, not only in the second quarter but in the first quarter and across each of our geographies. 
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, David. I want to thank you all for joining our call this evening.

 Mark Loughridge, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
Thanks, Patricia. In Q1 we delivered $20.7 billion in revenue, which is down 10% as reported. Without PCs and the impact of currency, revenue was up 4%. Our pretax income was $2.4 billion, up 21%, and we delivered EPS of $1.08, up 27% YtoY. 
Remember that in 2005 our Q1 results included the PC business. On a comparable basis, without the now-divested PC business, revenue was slack, but up 4% at constant currency. Our pretax income was up 24% and EPS was up 30%. Our cash and balance sheet remains strong. Net cash from operations, excluding Global Financing receivables was $700 million, up $1.6 billion YtoY. 
We ended the quarter with $12.3 billion of cash on hand and low debt levels from our non financing business. Before getting into the details of our Q1 results, I want to spend a moment on a discussion of the structure of our business. We’ve done a lot to reposition our business model over the last couple of years to focus on higher-value solutions. We’ve exited commoditizing businesses such as hard disk drives, displays and most recently the PC business. At the same time, we’ve been a strategic acquirer of higher-value software and services capabilities. 
The result is a business structure and profit profile that is relatively balanced between services, hardware and software. The business mix varies by the quarter, based on the skew of our business throughout the year. In Q1, hardware and financing represented a smaller percentage, as is typical. The strength of the IBM business model is not in any single component, is it in our ability to integrate and package across our segments, to create solution offerings for our clients, and by executing that model we can generate more consistent cash and earnings over the long term, enabling investments for future growth and consistent returns of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. 
At the same time, we’re working to create a truly globally integrated company. Let me give you a few examples. Last year, we restructured our European operation to create a more streamlined and efficient management system and more competitive cost structure. We have globalized our support functions and created global competencies in our services business, to leverage our scale, drive efficiency and increase responsiveness. We’re shifting resourced to utilize highly skilled talent in emerging countries. 
We saw the benefit of these actions in the second half of 2005 and it continued in Q1. As get into the details of the quarterly results, you’ll see that our performance once again reflects the strength of our business model, the global scope of our enterprise and the ability of our broad portfolio to consistently generate strong earnings in cash. 
Now let’s start with revenue, chart four. Total revenue in Q1 was down 10% YtoY as reported. Without the PC business, revenue was flat. Without the PC business and the impact of currency our revenue was up 4%. Global Services was down 1% YtoY as reported, but up 3% at constant currency. The cumulative effect of YtoY improvement in long-term signings over the last several quarters and an increase in short-term signings in the current quarter contributed to a sequential improvement in the revenue growth rate. Hardware revenue was down 32% as reported. Without the PC business in our 2005 results, hardware was up 3% and up 6% at constant currency. 
Our hardware results were mixed by brand, with good performance in microelectronics, System X servers and our storage business offset by weak sales in other server brands. Software revenue was up 2% and up 6% at constant currency. This performance was led by double-digit growth in our key middleware brands, with particular strength in WebSphere and Tivoli. 
Global Financing revenue was up 1% as reported and up 4% at constant currency, driven by the interest rate environment and customer financing originations, or signings, were up double digits. 
Now let’s turn to revenue by geography, chart 5. This provides the best view of our ongoing geographic performance. I’ll focus my comments on the results without PCs at constant currency. Looking at the geographies, at 6% the Americas delivered its best growth rate in six quarters, led by software and services performance. All regions grew, with continued solid performance in the United States. Growth in Europe accelerated to 3%. France and Spain showed solid growth and Italy returned to growth. The UK was also up, but Germany declined. While results remain mixed by country, overall our performance improved due to a combination of a slowly improving economic environment and better execution under our new management system. 
Asia-Pacific revenue declined 2% this quarter. The performance continued to be impacted by Japan, which represents about 60% of the Asia-Pacific revenue base. We’re continuing to implement actions to improve performance. While we saw modest improvements this quarter, revenues still declined. In all other Asia-Pacific regions growth improved. The strongest growth came from China and India. China and India, together with Brazil and Russia represent our key emerging countries. Together, these four countries grew 18%. YtoY growth was led by India, up 61% over Q1 last year while China grew 15%, Brazil grew 1% and Russia 48%. 
We’re building capability in these emerging countries, especially in India and China. In these two countries alone, we ended Q1 with 45,000 resources to support the local demand as well as global demand. But it’s not just about putting resources in low-cost countries. It’s about having access to the right skills in the right places, for the right tasks. It’s about bringing together the front-end capabilities with the back-end processes, to provide higher-value solutions. We’ll continue to shift investments to these high-growth markets. Finally, our OEM growth was 26% in Q1 driven by strong game chip performance in our microelectronics business. 
Now we’ll move on to our gross profit, chart six. Gross profit margin in Q1 was 39.1%, up 3.1 points YtoY. Without the improvements from divesting the low margin PC business, margin was up five-tenths of a point. Global Services gross profit margin was up 2.3 points YtoY. The trends we saw in the second half of last year continued, with the improvement achieved through good yield from our productivity initiative, and improved utilization. 
Hardware gross profit margin improved 3.6 points YtoY, driven by the divestiture of the PC business. Without PCs, the hardware gross profit margin was down 4.1 points. We’ll comment on margin dynamics when we get to the hardware section. Software gross profit margin improved four tenths, lifted by strong revenue performance off a relatively fixed cost base. Global Financing gross profit margin was down 1.3 points, due primarily to lower financing spreads. For the quarter, Global Financing’s return on equity was 34%. 
Now let’s turn to expense, chart seven. Total expense and other income declined 10% in Q1, as reported. Without the PC results in 2005, expense and other income were better by 6%. Expense to revenue was 27.3%, about flat as reported, but improved 1.7 points YtoY, adjusting for the divested PC business. Each quarter, to help investors understand the drivers of our operational performance, we highlight those items in cost and expense that significantly impacted our profit growth. We refer to this as our roadmap. In Q1, we had a couple of items that significantly helped our profit growth. We continued to benefit from our Q2 2005 productivity initiatives. These actions were designed to give us a more competitive cost structure and more pricing flexibility. As we discussed in the past, some of the benefit flows through the price, some is invested back in the business and some goes to the bottom line. 
Total equity compensation was down about $85 million YtoY, due primarily to lower grants over the last few years. Continued workforce rebalancing is a part of any vital company, with the amount in any quarter likely to vary. During Q1 these charges were down $65 million YtoY. In Q1, other income benefited from a $94 million YtoY increase through interest income, reflecting our strong cash balance and increasing interest rates. 
Turning to the items that hurt our YtoY profit growth, retirement-related plans, both pension and retiree medical, generated $623 million of cost and expense in the quarter, a YtoY hurt of $74 million. For the full year, we now expect these plans to cost us between $2.3-2.4 billion, a $200-300 million year over year impact, excluding last year’s one-time charges. This is less than the previously estimated $400-500 million range due to reductions in our non-US pension funds. Though we’re still facing a significant YtoY increase, we’re making progress in our efforts to mitigate the impact. 
Before moving on to cash flow performance, let me comment on currency. The US dollar has generally strengthened since Q1 2005. IBM hedges its major cross-border cash flows and as a result mitigates the effect of currency volatility in the year over year results. The impact of these hedging programs is principally reflected in other income and expense as well as cost of goods sold. This quarter, consistent with Q4, hedging programs account for approximately $150 million of an improvement in other income and expense. Keep in mind that this benefit offsets the negative impact of currency translation throughout our income statement. I’m not going to predict future currency moves, but at current spot rates we would expect a 1-2 point impact to revenue growth in Q2 before moderating in 2H06. Over an extended period of time, a stronger US dollar negatively impacts IBM’s revenue and earnings. The supplemental chart at the end of the presentation benchmarks currency’s potential future impact on revenue, assuming Monday’s exchange rate. 
Now let’s turn to cash flow, chart eight. In Q1 we had outstanding cash generation. Our cash from operations, excluding Global Financing receivables was the strongest Q1 we have seen in the last five years, driven by earnings in accounts receivable performance. This cash flow analysis chart has one primary difference from the FAS 95 format. It considers Global Financing receivables as an investment to generate profits, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. In Q1, net cash provided from operations, excluding the change in Global Financing receivables, was over $700 million, an increase of over $1.6 billion from last year. 
Last year, in Q1 we contributed $1.7 billion to the US pension fund, while this year we made a $1 billion pension contribution to the UK pension fund. Excluding the pension funding from both years, we generated over $900 million more cash from operations YtoY. Our cash performance was driven primarily by growth in net income and our continued focus on working capital and supply chain management. Within working capital, receivables collections continued to improve. Inventory decreased over $450 million YtoY. Adjusted for the sale of the PC business, inventory was down over $275 million, primarily in microelectronics. Also in working capital, we paid out $250 million in restructuring cash payments, and funded a $1 billion contribution to the UK pension fund in Q1 2006. 
Turning to our use of cash for investments, net capital expenditures were $1 billion, consistent with last year’s activity. Let me make a subtotal here, since many investors look at cash flow after capital expenditures. Net of capital expenditures, we had a use of cash of less than $300 million, a net increase in cash flows of $1.6 billion YtoY. Without the pension contributions, we generated over $900 million more cash flow this year. 
Next, our Global Financing receivables, net of changes and Global Financing debt, were a source of $2.9 billion. This is almost $200 million less than last year. We spent approximately $700 million on acquisitions in Q1, driven primarily by the software acquisition of Micromuse. 
We continue to drive very strong returns to shareholders. We returned over $2.8 billion to investors in Q1. $2.5 billion of this was through share repurchase. We bought back over 31 million shares, and average diluted shares were at 1.6 billion, down 4.4% from a year ago. We have approximately $2.5 billion remaining at the end of March from our last board authorization. In Q1 we paid out over $300 million in dividends. Over the last 10 years, we have returned over $70 billion to our shareholders, through share buybacks and dividends. 
Moving on to chart nine, we’ll discuss the balance sheet. Our cash on hand was $12.3 billion. 94% of our total debt of $22.5 billion was driven by our Global Financing business, and Global Financing was leveraged at an appropriate 6.9:1. The remaining non-financing debt level was about $1.4 billion and debt to capital was 4.4%. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we’re well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities and meet our cash needs. 
Now let’s turn to our business units, starting with Global Services, chart 10. Global Services delivered revenue of $11.6 billion, declining 1% as reported, and up 3% at constant currency. Signings for services this quarter were $11.4 billion at constant currency. Short-term signings were up 5%, and longer-term signings were up 20%. This quarter, we signed 13 deals larger than $100 million and our backlog remains stable, estimated at $111 billion. 
Before turning to our services businesses, let me remind you of the management system changes we made to last quarter. Global Services’ segment results will now be reported as two segments. Global Technology Services segment primarily reflects infrastructure services, delivering value to our global scale, standardization and automation. It includes our outsourcing businesses, both strategic and business transformation, Integrated Technology Services and maintenance. Global Business Services segment primarily reflects professional services, delivering business value and innovation to our clients through solutions which leverage industry and business process expertise. It includes consulting, systems integration and application management services. 
With these new segments, we’re providing additional information to help investors understand our services business, including revenue performance of our business transformation outsourcing business, and long and short-term signings for each of these segments. 
Let me get into each of the businesses. Global Technology Services delivered revenue of $7.7 billion, declining 1% as reported, but up 2% at constant currencies. For the segment, longer-term signings were up 40% YtoY and shorter-term signings were up 3%. We delivered double digit signings growth across all geographies in the quarter. Strategic outsourcing revenue was down 3% as reported and flat at constant currencies. Signings increased 50% YtoY, led by stronger growth in the Americas, with both Europe and Asia-Pacific also growing double digits. Business transformation outsourcing revenue was up 47% as reported and up 51% at constant currency. I should note that one large contract renegotiation drove 12 points of the growth. 
Our BTO revenue grew in all geographies, reflecting broad-based customer acceptance of our offerings. BTO signings were down 9% year to year, coming off a very strong growth in 2005. Like strategic outsourcing, BTO engagements are longer-term and so signings in any period can be lumpy. Integrated Technology Services revenue was down 6% as reported, and down 3% at constant currency. 
Revenue continued to be impacted by signings declined in Q3 and Q4 2005. We’re continuing to implement actions to improve the Integrated Technology Services business. We’ve added about one third more people into our business development and sales coverage roles. We’ll be focused on selling our infrastructure solutions and our traditional services. The infrastructure solutions that we’ve launched are gaining traction in the market as customers see the value created by leveraging IBM’s market-leading software and hardware. For example, we see strong interest in IT resources optimization, end user services and business continuity. While we still have work to do; we did see a reversal in the signings trend this quarter - up 3%. 
Turning to margins, Global Technology Services pre-tax margin was 10.3%, an improvement of 2.5 points YtoY. This was driven by the cost and expense benefit of last year’s productivity initiative, sales execution and operational improvements and better contract profiles. Global Business Services delivered $3.8 billion of revenue, declining 1% as reported but up 4% at constant currency. For the segment, shorter-term signings were up 5% YtoY and longer-term signings were down 27%. Revenue performance this quarter were driven by strong growth in our consulting offerings in the Americas and in our application management services offerings in the Americas and Europe. 
Overall, revenue growth however continues to be impacted by weakness in Asia-Pacific and in particular Japan. Last quarter I talked about some of the actions we were taking to improve growth in our consulting business. Let me give you a sense of how we are doing. We are continuing to increase the level of dedicated sales resource to drive our business and web services and SOA solutions. We invested in resource to address mid-market opportunities which contributed to double digit growth in small and medium business. We increased the level of services resource in Asia-Pacific. This quarter, shorter-term signings growth exceeded 20% but we still have more work to do to yield better results in this region. 
Turning to margin, Global Business Services pre-tax margin was 8.5%, an improvement of 4.7 points YtoY. This represents a substantial improvement in margin. The improvement came from increased utilization and operational improvements, and the cost and expense benefit from last year’s productivity initiative. (To wrap up?) Q1 for Global Services, we’re beginning to see the expected turnaround in our services business, driven by long-term signings growth over the past four quarters. We have improved growth in Global Business Services, indicating that we are beginning to get traction from the initiative we’ve implemented over the past two quarter. We improved margins in both service segments while making our services business more cost competitive. To improve performance going forward, we will continue to focus on actions to improve our Integrated Technology Services business and Global Business Services in Japan. 
Now I’ll move on to systems and technology growth, chart 11. Systems and Technology Group revenue of $4.4 billion grew 3% YtoY and 6% at constant currency. Growth was led by microelectronics, System X servers, storage and retail store solutions. While gross margin was up for hardware overall, excluding the PC business in 2005 it was down YtoY. Product mix negatively impacted systems and technology profit on two levels. First, we had strong growth in our lower-margin businesses, microelectronics and System X servers. Second, within most of our system brands, we had better performance in the low end of the product lines, which typically have lower margins. Turning to the brand, System Z revenue declined 6% YtoY at actual currency, down 2% at constant currency. MIPS grew 22% YtoY, driven by continued strong customer acceptance of specialty engines for Linux and Java workloads. Over 35% of the MIPS shipped were on these engines, the largest percentage of specialty engines in a quarter. 
These engines are priced aggressively to drive these workloads onto the platform. This is good for the longer term, but because the engines are priced aggressively, the MIPS impacted our revenue and margin in the quarter. We expect a more typical workload mix in the future. We continue to add capability to platform and later this month we will announce our new midrange System Z. 
The workload mix, together with new capabilities, will help to drive improved performance in Q2. System I revenue declined 22% and 19% at constant currency, as customers evaluated the refreshed System I products which became generally available in February. Revenue declines are not unusual in the quarter that we roll out a new product announcement. System I had strong volumes and revenue growth in its low end and express models, which target the small and medium business market space. We expect to see improvement in the midrange and high end of the product lines as the year progresses. System P Unix servers declined 9% in the quarter, down 6% at constant currency. System P volumes were up 9%, however revenue performance reflects a mix towards lower-end offerings. 
We expect more balance in the mix in Q2, as we’ll have our first full quarter of shipments of our new 570s, and QuadCore(?) 560 midrange models. System P will complete its transition to POWER5+ in Q3. System X servers grew 10% YtoY and 13% at constant currency, with growth in all geographies. Server volumes grew over 20%, reflecting continued strong performance in Blades, which grew over 45% in both volumes and revenue. We had strong customer acceptance of the new BladeCenter 8, the industry’s first high-speed chassis. We believe we gained share in System X servers, and maintained our leadership in Blade. 
Total storage grew 6%, 9% at constant currency. Total disks grew 6%, driven by strength in the midrange. Our storage virtualization momentum continued with strong growth in Q1. Tape grew 5% in the quarter. We believe we held share in both tape and disk storage. Microelectronics revenue grew 37% YtoY, based on strong client demand in the game processor business. The annex of our East Fishkill fab is now operation and supporting production of 90 nanometer product and 65 nanometer development. Engineering and technology services revenue declined 15% YtoY as we wrapped around on last year’s strong performance. We continue to leverage IBM’s advanced technologies with new customers in their innovative projects. 
For example, NTS leverages its system design capability to collaborate with St. Jude Medical in the design, development and manufacturing of a patient care management system for implantable cardiac devices. Physicians will use the system to more efficiently conduct tests, review stored data and program the implanted devices for optimal patient care. Earlier this year, we announced the technology collaboration solutions organization, which combines engineering and technology services, OEM microelectronics and other key capabilities including our IT portfolio. These capabilities help our clients leverage collaborative innovation, spanning the entire technology lifecycle from the conceptual design to production. Technology collaboration solutions will drive synergistic flows from IBM’s core technologies. 
 Now let’s move on to software, chart 12. Software, at $3.9 billion, was up 2% YtoY and was up 6% at constant currency. This growth was driven by our key middleware products while operating systems and product lifecycle management software declined. Our key branded middleware products continued to benefit from investments in development, sales and marketing, capturing the emerging trends in the marketplace. Our strategic acquisitions also add to the breadth and depth of this portfolio. As a result, we are well-positioned in these fast-growing technologies and our Q1 results point to the progress we’ve made. 
Key branded middleware is made up of five key brands which provide an integrated suite for our customers. The WebSphere Family of software grew 26% and was up 30% at constant currency. WebSphere provides the foundation for web-enabled applications and is a key product set in deploying services-oriented architectures. We are the market leader in SOA and are seeing strong demand for our WebSphere products, including the application server, portal and our business integration products. We believe we gained share for the quarter. Information management software grew 6% and was up 10% at constant currency. We continue to enhance and expand our information management portfolio with products built around information on demand. 
We had particularly strong performance in our information integration product set, as essential products continue to build momentum. We believe we gained share in this market, and grew faster than our closest competitor. Lotus software was flat YtoY, up 5% at constant currency. Our Lotus products provide customers with collaborative solutions which enable the integration of people, data and business processes as part of IBM’s on demand and SOA strategies. In a mature market, our Domino products had competitive pressure. However, adoption of Lotus workplace software continues, more than doubling YtoY. Tivoli software was up 24% and up 28% at constant currency. Our growth was broad based, with systems management, security and storage software all delivering double digit revenue growth in the quarter. 
Our portfolio of storage software products have been embraced by our customers and business partners, due to their competitive price points and superior functionality. Midway through the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of Micromuse, which contributed profit in the quarter. Customers are quickly recognizing the value of the combined Micromuse and Tivoli product portfolios to help them manage their IT-based business service needs. We believe Tivoli gained share for the quarter. Rational software was down 8% and down 4% at constant currency in a slowing market. In total, our key branded middleware improved 11% YtoY and was up 14% at constant currency. Other middleware was down 1% as reported, but up 1% at constant currency. 
Other middleware includes legacy products which provide a stable base of profits but grow at more modest rates. Operating system software declined 12%, down 9% at constant currency. Operating systems are closely tied to our server products, and provide a sound, cost-effective platform for our middleware and solutions. Growth this quarter was impacted by new product introductions in our midrange servers. Product Lifecycle Management, or PLM software, is now included in the software segment. PLM software includes computer-aided design and manufacturing products typically used in automotive, aerospace and other industrial customers. In Q1 a number of automotive companies delayed purchases, resulting in a modest decline in revenue. Overall, our software business had another solid quarter. 
In 2005 we gained share in all five key brands and with double digit growth in key branded middleware this quarter, we believe we continued to take share overall in Q1. This revenue growth drove strong bottom line results. Software segment pretax margin grew 4.3 points YtoY to 23.1%. 
Now I’ll wrap up on chart 13. We have a balanced portfolio of businesses; hardware, software and services, designed to deliver our longer-term financial objective of double digit EPS growth. The strength and breadth of the model comes from it being able to bring these business together to consistently deliver solid overall profit performance. This quarter, we had improving fundamentals in our services business. Signings, both long-term and short-term were up YtoY. This translated to improved revenue growth and we again improved our margins. 
In hardware, we had good performance in microelectronics, storage and our System X servers, while our other server brands were impacted by new product introductions and mix. Our strong software performance was led by our key branded middleware products, especially WebSphere and Tivoli, reflecting strong demands for products deploying services-oriented architectures and the value of our systems management, security and storage offerings. For Q1 our profit performance was once again driven by a combination of unit performance, portfolio action and execution of our productivity initiatives. 
Our services, hardware and software businesses together drove revenue growth of 4%, profit growth of 21%, EPS growth of 27% and solid cash performance. Given our start for the year, we are on track to deliver EPS growth for 2006 in line with the IBM model. This is consistent with the average of your estimates for the year. 
Before going to Q&A, I wanted to mention our investor meeting later this quarter. As I stated up front, we are working to create at truly globally integrated company. One important element of our strategy is leveraging performance in emerging countries including India and China. We’d like to share our unique global capabilities and for that reason we’re hosting our investor meeting in India in June. We have a full two-day agenda planned. You’ll have an opportunity to attend a large employee event, to visit our facilities at Bangalore and to meet face to face with major business leaders from Asia. You can get more information on the event from Patricia, and our investor relations team. We’re excited about the program and I hope that you’ll join us on June 6th and 7th in Bangalore. Now Patricia and I will take your questions. 
Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, let me comment on two items. First, as always we have a few supplemental charts at the end of the deck that complement Mark’s prepared remarks. Second, I’d ask you to refrain from multipart questions. This will allow us to take questions from more callers. OK, Operator, let’s open it up for questions. 
Questions and Answers
Operator
Thank you. That is *1 to ask a question. Our first question is from Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may begin. 
Q – Tony Sacconaghi, Sanford Bernstein
Yes, thank you. Mark, I realize that you typically do not provide specific guidance for investors, but you often do provide a qualitative assessment of the direction and your sentiment for the business looking forward. Specifically, can you comment on whether you are comfortable with current analyst EPS estimates for Q2 through Q4 as they now stand? Secondly, can you comment on the pipeline as it looks for services? Is it better, worse or the same as it was at the end of Q4? Thirdly, can you comment on whether you believe hardware or services has the biggest opportunity for improvement looking forward? 
A – Mark Loughridge
OK, Tony, thank you very much for that question. First of all, let’s talk about our view of guidance. Number one, on EPS base, I’ve got to admit we’ve just got through a first quarter and had very strong performance. I mean, earnings up 21%, EPS up 27%, revenue up 4%, so we’re running this business really for the long term and remain confident in our longer-term model. We deliver this through a combination of revenue growth, productivity and cash generation. I would say that in any particular quarter of the year, our performance can vary from the model, but as I look forward it would be difficult to leave the first quarter and not be quite confident as we go forward. As we said in the text, I think the analyst estimates and relatively the skew of that business estimate through the year looks reasonable. 
Your second question was on pipeline. First of all, if you look at the deals that we’re facing, we like the opportunities we see going into this second quarter. We’ll remind you that we had particularly strong signings in the second quarter last year, particularly in the long-term signings. If you look at Q1, we had really good momentum in our short-term business, and we think that should continue as we go through the second quarter. In addition, our long-term signings as we exited 2005 were up 19% and here we see now, our long-term signings up 20% and underneath that, SO up 50. All of that bodes well for that business as we go forward. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Shope with JP Morgan. 
Q – Bill Shope, JP Morgan
OK, great, thanks. Mark, you cited product transitions and mix as the primary factors behind the margin and potentially the high-end revenue pressures in the hardware division. Can you give me any color on whether you saw any incrementally aggressive pricing from competitors, or potentially some unexpected macro pressures on the segment, because we are seeing some signs of weakness in servers in general across the industry. Could you give us any color there? 
A – Mark Loughridge 
 Yes, let me give you a perspective. First of all, I don’t think that in general we saw increased pricing pressure in the quarter. Once again, I want to frame the hardware performance in the quarter and reiterate, this is a very light hardware quarter for us if you look to a normal distribution throughout the year. Returning to your question on pricing, in the Z series, the price at the product level was in line with our historical trends. We saw some accelerated decline and in our overall prices our mix shifted, but that’s because we were driving that through workloads typified by the specialty MIPS engines. System I, we did experience some price pressure in the midrange. On P series we’re finding select countries in Asia-Pacific and EMEA to be particularly competitive. On X series, our price pressure continued and our Q1 were more pronounced in the US than in Europe, and in storage really price pressure remains really high, most notably on enterprise disk and SAND(?) products. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Bill, let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Laura Conigliaro with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. 
Q – Laura Conigliaro, Goldman Sachs
Yes. Given the fact that you saw pretty solid services signings growth last year, and you had pretty good services signings this year, you’re still going to need to average maybe $12.5 billion per quarter for the remainder of the year to get to say a low single digit growth number for the year. With the deal sizes getting smaller, and several deals where IBM is the incumbent coming up for bid this year, where you’re presumably not going to win all of them, is there actually enough business out there for you to reasonably expect say 4-5%, or will single digits be low to mid single digits type growth for all of 2006? And I’m sorry to ask this, but could you please clarify ‘other income’, which was considerably higher this quarter than it was last year? 
A – Mark Loughridge
Let me first of all start with signings. Signings first of all I think has a lot of opportunity, and now we go back to the characteristics we saw in this quarter. I mean, long-term signings up 20% - that is real capability that will provide growth as in stability over time. Short-term signings are up 5%, so that’s low real performance on our near-term performance in the quarter, so we see good opportunities out there over the long term, consistent with our business model and frankly consistent with the long-term trends that we saw as we exited 2005. 
As far as other income, we had $150 million YtoY from hedges as we said. That was predominantly consistent with our Q4 performance where we were up $150 million as well. Now there are offsets in other parts of the P&L. So where we would have seen offsets and a relative revenue on cost in the other parts of the P&L, we saw some benefit in hedging. The other $94 million was driven by interest income, and that was basically a factor of our large cash balance that we have. I look at both of those in context of a very powerful quarter plus 27%. So with hedging $150 million consistent with Q4 performance, the other interest income off our large cash balance. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Laura, let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Rebecca Runkle with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. 
Q – Rebecca Runkle, Morgan Stanley
Thanks. Good afternoon, Mark. Just following up and trying to understand some of the lower costs related to the retirement plans for the share, if I take a step back given the first quarter performance and some of the upbeat commentary that you’re providing, is it fair to say that IBM could hit its long-term growth model, axing out the retirement impact, because that lower cost of retirement plans for this year is pretty accretive to the bottom line and some might argue that that’s not quite purely operational in nature, and I’m just trying to understand from a pure operational stand point, do you look at IBM being able to hit that long-term target this year? 
A – Mark Loughridge
Sure. Let me talk about that a little. First of all, let’s put this in context. As we look at retirement-related expense, our January view was that the expense would be $2.5-2.6 billion. Currently, we’re viewing that at $2.3-2.4 billion. It is still a headwind of $200-300 million that we need to overcome as part of our business model. So I would not look at that change and necessarily make that additive, because right now what we need to do is to develop the execution plan and continue to overcome that pension impact on a YtoY basis. I will say, we’re very committed to our long-term business model and our objective of double digit EPS growth. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks Rebecca, let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Harry Blount with Lehman Brothers. You may begin. 
Q – Harry Blount, Lehman Brothers
Great, thank you very much. The question is on margins. Starting next quarter, you start to anniversary on some of the productivity initiatives you’ve taken. As we look at the total opex, and given your comments about letting some flow through to the bottom line versus taking some into the business, I was wondering if you could maybe comment about the absolute level of operating expenses as they currently stand. Then also, related to the software business, trying to get some sense of how the middleware and total software may have looked, excluding the acquisitions and the revenue reclass. 
A – Mark Loughridge
OK. Well let’s take your first question. I think what you were really looking at was the yield off the restructuring as we see it throughout the year and how it played out in our business. So number one, you remember that we said that restructuring in the year would yield $1.3 billion in savings, and on a YtoY basis that would be about $800 million. If you look at $800 million, we’ll see that through the second and the third quarters and we’re probably 35-40% of our way through that yield. If you remember, we had said that that restructuring, about 70% of it, was oriented towards our services business. Let’s now talk about how that exhibits itself within services. If you assume that all of that went to the bottom line, which I personally think is an extreme assumption, but if you did assume that, that would be about one third of the improvement that we saw in our Global Technology Services, which was up 2.5 points YtoY. It was about 40% for Global Business Services, which was up 4.7 points. So there was a lot of margin improvement over and above the yield that we got out of that restructuring yield, and if you looked at it through the course of the year, we’re probably about one third to 40% of the way through that $800 million. 
Patricia Murphy
OK thanks, Harry, let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you, that’s Richard Farmer with Merrill Lynch. You may begin. 
Q – Richard Farmer, Merrill Lynch
First, a quick clarification on your comments on the P series transition. I think you said you expect it to be complete by Q3, that would seem to imply that we could still see some transition issues in the June quarter – is that correct? Then the real question is on middleware. You had a lot of strength in WebSphere and Tivoli which was a big reversal from desolidation(?) in those businesses last quarter. What was different this quarter, that enabled you to execute so much better in those software categories? 
A – Mark Loughridge
OK, well first of all let’s go back to your P series question. Number one, if you look at that product transition, we announced the POWER5+ on the midrange in February. We did experience extended sales cycle on a higher than normal weight at the (inaudible) out of the quarter, we should recapture that as we go into the second quarter. We did point out that the high end will move to POWER5+ technology in the third, which will complete its product transition, but in the second quarter we should see that midrange capitalize on the Q1 introduction. 
As far as software is concerned, I mean number one, I’m very impressed with software performance in the quarter. Granted, middleware as a category up 14% at constant currency, led by WebSphere that was up 30%, Tivoli up 28% and information management up 10%, so I think it was strong execution on the part of our software organization, real capability in product breadth and especially strength in SOA as we move forward. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Richard, let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Next question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of America. You may begin. 
Q – Keith Bachman, Bank of America
Hi, thanks. I wanted to go to the Asia-Pacific if we could for a second, in terms of - you mentioned it was a bit of an improvement, a modest improvement from last quarter in a year over year basis. What needs to happen in order for that to be less of a drag on your operations, or even run at the same rate as the rest of IBM? And is it primarily the services? If you give us a little more color on how Asia-Pacific and Japan specifically gets fixed. 
A – Mark Loughridge
First of all, when I look at Asia-Pacific, frankly I think they did pretty well on hardware and they did pretty well on software. If we then kind of did a view of the units, China group 15%, and Asia again posted strong results. India was up over 60% so a really strong performance in these emerging parts of our marketplace. 
So that really leaves Japan. We did see I think a more stable level of performance in Japan, but we do need to improve the execution as we go forward. That will probably exhibit itself more in the second half of the year, but I’ve got to say, when you look at Japan you’ve got to remember that though we’ve had some operational issues that have affected our growth on the margins, this is one of the largest and the most powerful businesses in Japan. Highly profitable, we’ve got a broad base of business based on strong customer relationships that take years to establish. You’re talking about what is fundamentally a very strong base of business to being with, we just need to exhibit growth as we go through the quarter on that base. 
Patricia Murphy
Thanks, Keith, let’s go to the next question please. 
Operator
Thank you, that’s Ben Reitzes with UBS. You may begin. 
Q – Ben Reitzes, UBS Warburg
Good afternoon, thank you. Could you talk, Mark, about the gross margin a little bit more? And other income? As we go throughout the year with gross margin being a little below our expectations in hardware, just how does that progress and you fix it? Is it MIPS? And just a little more color – I know you said some things, but if you can clarify. Then with this other income dynamic, do we keep seeing these kinds of benefits from hedging or does that clearly go away in the second half and we start seeing a more normal other income number there when currency flattens out? 
A – Mark Loughridge
OK. First of all, on gross margin; I think we had really strong performance on gross margin in our services business. That was driven by real discipline and execution capability in those business. I think we should continue to see that level of performance as we go through the year. Software margins, again very, very strong. So that really leaves hardware, and hardware margins are really a function of the mix of businesses that we have and we need to recalibrate to emphasize the high end of those businesses and within the deep platform, drive more of our traditional workload as well as capitalize on the introduction of our new Z midrange product. So on a margin basis, I think we actually had a very strong quarter and I feel very good about our margins going forward throughout the balance of the year. 
Secondly, on your comment on currency, I mean if you look we gave you an example at current spot rates what the impact of currency would be. Q2 would be about a 1 to a 2 point impact and that would moderate as we go through the second half. Obviously as you do that, we will see less benefit from hedging on currencies but you’ll see more improvement in the balance or I&E. So generally, there is an offset within our hedging program. If hedges have more contribution, it’s because the balance of the I&E was impacted. If hedges have less contribution, it’s because the balance of the I&E has done relatively better. 
Patricia Murphy
OK, thanks, Ben. Operator, let’s take one last question. 
Operator
Thank you. Our last question will be from Richard Gardner with Citigroup. You may begin. 
Q – Richard Gardner, Citigroup
Thanks very much. Mark, you talked about the negative mix shift of specialty engines in the quarter within the mainframe business. I was hoping you could talk about how much control you have over workload mix and that difference from quarter to quarter and what it is that gives you confidence that the mix will rebound back to your more traditional workloads in Q2 and beyond. Then maybe if you could also help us understand the implications of a workload shift to specialty engines for the services and software businesses? Thanks. 
A – Mark Loughridge
I think number one, I would look at the characteristics of the quarter. You know, Richard, number one this is a light quarter for hardware. I think it’s relatively difficult to interpret trends off a first quarter performance on a hardware base of business. Now, we did have a much higher mix of specialty engines but I don’t think that’s typical of our base of business going forward. It was a characteristic within the first quarter. Specialty engines are geared for very high growth opportunities that we see in the marketplace and we will see downstream benefits from those in other parts of our business, but I don’t think that’s necessarily a characteristic. As far as our control of our destiny, number one it’s really driven by our continued execution and as I said on the call, introduction of our new Z series platform for our midrange Z products. 
Patricia Murphy

Mark Loughridge, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Patricia. In the fourth quarter we delivered $24.4 billion in revenue which was down 12% as reported. Without PC’s in the impact of currency revenue was up 3%. Our pre-tax income was $4.6 billion this includes about $180 million of gain from certain real estate transactions as compared to the $75 million previously estimated. And we delivered $2.1 of earnings pre share up 20% year-to-year. This quarter we have one Non-recurring item. On January 5th we have announced changes to our US pension plan. We recorded one time pre-tax charge of $267 million in the fourth quarter for the curtailment of these plans.
When you exclude the non-recurring charge, IBM pre-tax profit was $4.8 billion and we delivered $2.11 of earnings pre share up 26% over the last years fourth quarter. But the most appropriate comparison is to last year's fourth quarter without the divested PC business as this view best reflex our ongoing performance. The details and description at the PC results are included in our supplemental charts.
On this comparable basis, revenue was down 1% as reported but up 3% at constant currency. Our pre-tax income was up 22% and earnings per share were up 29%. Looking at our results by business in hardware we had strong performance in storage, microelectronics, and bSerious and pSerious servers.
In software, performance is led by our key branded middleware products, especially information management and Tivole. Our services business had improved margin performance, driven primarily by benefits from our productivity initiatives. And across geographies the strongest results were posted by the America’s, which executed well on a solid demand environment. These results once again reflect the strength of our business model, the global scope of our enterprise and the ability of our broad portfolio to consistently generate earnings in cash.
Let's move on to our full year performance with chart 4. In 2005 our reported results included PC’s results for 4 months and non-recurring items. As reported we delivered $91.1 billion of revenue down 5% year-to-year. Pre-tax earnings were $12.2 billion up 15% and earnings per share were $4.91 up 12%.
Without the non-recurring items in 2004 and 2005. Our per-tax earnings were $12.4 billion up 12% and earnings pre share were $5.32 up 18%. To view the best represents on going operational performance IBM results without Non-recurring items in divested PC business. On this basis we delivered $88.3 billion at revenue up 3% as reported in a constant currency.
Pre-tax earnings were 12.5 billion up 15% year-to-year with solid growth and contribution from hardware, software and services. And earnings per share were $5.36 up 21%. Net cash from operation excluding global financing receivables was $13.1 billion up $200 million year-to-year. We had record returns to share holders from the share buybacks and dividends of $9 billion. We ended the year with $13.7 billion of cash on hand and low debt levels for Non- financing business. In 2005 our return on invested capital was 24% excluding our global financing business in the Non-recurring charges.
Earlier in the year we said we would deliver a profit more to cost expense performance than revenue. Throughout the year we leveraged our productivity initiatives to drive or pre share growth in excess of longer terms financial model objectives. We will continued to leveraged the cost efficiency of our model to drive profit growth as we move to 2006
And now let's get into the detail of the fourth quarter starting with the revenue chart 5. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was down 12% year-to-year as reported. Without the PC business revenue was down 1%. Currency negatively impacted our growth by 4 points, 1 point more than our estimates based on spot rates in mid-October. Without the impact of currency our revenue was up 3%. Global services was down 5% year-to-year as reported and down 1% at constant currency. The decline was driven primarily by our short term signing performance and by decline strategic out sourcing revenue. We’ll get into the service revenue dynamic when we discuss the services business. Hardware revenue was down 27% as reported. Without the PC business hardware was up 6% and up 9% at constant currency. We had strong double digit growth from our storage products and our microelectronics, OEM business. Software revenue was flat as reported and up 3% at constant currency. Our key middleware brands contributed high single digit growth at constant currency offset by declines in operating systems in other middle-ware products. Global financing revenue was down 8% as reported or 6% at constant currency driven by continued declined in the asset basis and lower level of used equipment sales.
Now lets turn to revenue by geography, chart 6. To provide the best view of our ongoing geographic performance I’ll focus my comments on the results without PC at constant currency. Looking at the major geography America’s performance was again driven by solid execution. The performance was broad based with growth across all key brands and all regions. Overall demand remains good as clients invest to improve competent of their infrastructure and to provide differentiated advantage in the market place.
Performance in Europe remain mixed. Revenue in Spain and Nordux was up. And France grew for the second consecutive quarter. Well, Germany’s growth rate improved Germany and Italy continue to decline. Although in these countries and in fact across all regions in Europe. We had good growth in hardware. After successful execution of their re-structuring action our new operating model with the more stream line management system in now in placed. Well hours to compete more effectively in these markets.
Asia pacific revenue decline this quarter. Japan which represents about 60% of the Asia pacific revenue based once again declined at constant currency. We continue to driver action to improve execution and as they take hold in the first quarter we expect improved performance. Medicating that clients in Japan, china grew and again goes to strong results lead by India.
China and India together with Brazil and Russia comprise the emerging countries that we discussed in the past quarter. For the year these emerging countries delivered 3.8 billion of revenue without PC and grew 14% at constant currency. Year-to-year growth was lead by India at 55%, while China grew 8%, Brazil 7%, and Russia 29%. We’ll continued to shift investment to these high growth markets.
Finally Our OEM growth was 35% in fourth quarter driven by the ramp up in our game chip processors. Now we’ll move on to gross profit chart 7.
Gross profit margins in the fourth quarter was 44.1% up 5.3 point year-to-year. Without the improvement from divesting the low margins PC business margin was up 2.2points Global services gross profit margin was up 3.1 point year-to-year as in the third quarter we had good yield from our productivity initiatives and a better contract profile.
Hardware gross profit margin improved over 9 point year-to-year driven by the divestitures the PC business. Without PC the hardware gross profit margin was flat. Software gross profit margin improves slightly. Global financing gross profit margin was down 2.3 point as we discussed in the past this business is more appropriately measured on return on equity. For the full year global financing return on equity was 33%. And now lets turn to expense chart 8.
Total Expenses in other income declined 7% in the fourth quarter as reported. Excluding the $267 million one time curtailment charge for a US pension plan change, expenses would be down 11%. Without the PC results in 2004 and pension charge, expenses in other income was better by 7%. On this basis expenses to revenue improved 1.7 points year-to-year and we improved our SG&A expenses to revenue ratio about half a point, down to 20.4%. Benefits from our second quarter productivity initiatives drove the year-to-year improvement.
By the end of the year essentially all of the impacted resources had excesses in the business. These are postures grew by a high level of saving in the fourth quarter yielding a large benefits cost expenses in the period. As in the third quarter most of the cost reduction went to the bottom line. Over the longer term these actions give us competitive cost structure more pricing flexibility and allow us to better manage escalating labor cost. Turning to our road map of item, that materially impacted earning growth, let me start with a two items that negatively impacted our growth. Retirement related plans both pension and health, were year-to-year of $522 million as reported including the one time curtailment charge. Excluding the curtailment charge, retirement related plans were heard, of $255 million. For the full year excluding charges in both years, retirement related cost was up approximately $ 1 billion, inline with our estimate as the beginning of 2005.
In spite of the fact that our pension plan changes will save us between $450 million and $500 million in 2006. Retirement related expense was still increase another $400 million to $500 million year-to-year. Excluding the impact of the 2005 one time charges. Additional details on our pension assumption and plan changes were posted to our investor website on January, 5th. Our profit growth was also impacted by a decline in IP income. Down about $70 million year-to-year. They were a couple of items that materially helped our earnings growth. Total equity compensation including the cost for restricted stock units and performance based awards, was down about a $140 million year-to-year.
We’ve included additional information on our equity compensation in the supplemental charge. Gains on real estate transaction were up almost a $160 million is year-to-year, this is reported in other income and expense. You recall the last quarter I told you we had some real estate transactions in process, and at the time our best assessments was that we would record a pre-tax gain of $75 million in the fourth quarter.
Our actual fourth quarter results include a pre-tax gain of a $182 million. Primarily comprised at the gain on the sale of an office building in Japan, partially offset by a charge to write down the building in the US.
The additional gain of a $107 million over our original estimate of $75 million was not offset as we had expected, by a loss in the sale of another building in Japan. We’re unable to reach agreement with the buyer, and the building remains in service for the company. When we comment on 2006 at the end of this presentation, there is a $107 million over achievement should be excluded. Turning to currency, US dollar had generally strengthened since year end 2004, especially against the European currencies.
IBM hedges its major cross border cash flows, and as a result, medicates the effects of currency volatility in the year-over-year results.
The impact of these hedging programs it’s principally reflected in other income and expense as well as cost a good sold. This quarter hedging program accounts for approximately, $150 million of the improvement in other income and expense. I’m not going to predict future currency moves, but our current spot rates currency were heard revenue growth in the next few quarters. Over an extended period of time, a strong US dollar negatively impacts IBM’s revenue in their earnings.
The supplement chart at the end of the presentation benchmarks currency potential future impact on revenue. Assuming Friday’s exchange rate, you’ll see that they found these rates we would expect a 3 to 4 point impact to revenue growth in the first quarter without PC’s, and a 2 point impact in the second quarter but for moderating in the second half.
Now let’s turn to cash flow chart 9. We had another outstanding year in cash generation, this cash flow analysis chart as one primary difference from the past 95 format.
It considers our global financing receivables as an investment to generate profit, not as working capital that should be minimize for efficiency. For 2005 net cash provided from operations excluding the change in global financing receivables was $13.1 billion and increase of over $200 million from last year. Our cash performance was driven primarily by our net income growth and our continued focus on working capital and supply chain management.
Within working capital adjusted for the sale of the PC business receivables collections continue to improve. Inventory decreased over $450 million year-to-year adjusted for the sale of the PC business inventory was down over $250 million and we receive $775 million in the third quarter from a settlement with Microsoft. We paid out $1.3 billion in re-structuring cash payments and funded $1.7 billion contribution to the US pension fund in the first quarter of 2005. $1 billion is more than was funded in 2004.
Turning to our use of cash for investments Net Capital Expenditures were approximately $3.5 billion. A decrease of approximately $200 million year-to-year. Let me make a sub-total here since many investors look at cash flow after capital expenditures. We generating cash flow of $9.6 billion about 400 million more than last year. Without the $1 billion of additional contribution to the US pension plan we generated $1.4 billion more cash flow this year. Next our global financing receivable net of changes in global financing debt were source of $1.3 billion due to continued decline in income generating assets.
We spend approximately $1.5 billion on acquisition in 2005 almost half of that was for the second quarter acquisition of essential. And we had net proceeds from divestitures of over 650 million driven by the sale of the PC business and about $270 million as the final settlement of the HTD divestitures. We turned a record $9 billion to investors this year and increase of over $650 million year-to-year. $7.7 billion of this was to share re-purchase. We bought back over 90 million shares and averages diluted share were at $1.6 billion down 4.7 % from a year ago. We have approximately $5 billion remaining at the end of December from our last ford authorization and we paid out over 1.2 billion in dividend
This year between our share re-purchase and dividend we were able to pay out to our share holders of a 100% of our net earnings. Even after investing $10 billion in R&D capital expenditures and acquisition. Moving on to chart 10, we will discuss the balance sheet. Our cash on hand was $13.7 billion over 90% of our total depth of $22.6 billion was driven by global financing business and global financing was leveraged that an appropriate 6.701
The remaining non-financing debt level was about $2.1 billion and debt capital was 6.7%. Majority of the debt increase was to facilitate the Homeland Repatriation and it expected to be significantly reduced by the end of 2006. Under this provision of the US tax law we were patriated $9.5 billion this year consistent with what we told you in October. Our balance sheet remain very strong and we are well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities and meet our cash needs. Now let’s turn to our three key business starting with global services chart 11. Global services delivered revenue of $12 billion declining 5% has reported and 1% constant currency.
The segment profit was up 18.5% year-to-year and the pre-tax margin improved to 11.9%. Signings for services this quarter were $12 billion at stock rate and a $11.5 billion at constant currency. This includes $5.3 billion of short term signings which were down 4% and $6.2 billion of long term signings. We signed 8 deals larger than a $100 million this quarter. Our backlog is estimate at a $111 billion as same as the year ago. Before turning to the three major business let me comment on services revenue dynamics. Revenue growth in a quarter is influenced by short term signings in the current entire quarter. Our short term businesses include integrated technology services, and the commercial content of consulting instance integration. As I said short turn signings were down 4% and we are essentially flat in the third quarter. Our long term business include strategic outsourcing, business transformation outsourcing and the federal content of consulting instance integration. Growth in these businesses have influenced by several factors. Including the accumulative effect of signings. Contract duration, extension and change in backlog overtime.
Turning to the three major segments, strategic outsourcing is declining 32% this quarter. Revenue was down 5% as reported and down 2% at constant currency. Strategic outsourcing revenue growth continue to be impacted by the high levels of backlog erosion, we experience in 2004 and the accumulative effect of lower signings starting in 2004, through the first quarter of 2005. integrated technology services excluding maintenance was down 5% year-to-year as reported and down 2% at constant currency. ITS signings this quarter were down 10%.
In 3Q I told you that we are in the process of making the necessary to alterative business to growth. The initial portfolio were balancing work is complete, for having business development skills and the sales coverage is lying to the revised portfolio. These changes will be operational in the first quarter. Business consulting services was down 6% as reported and down 1% at constant currency. This was driven by double digit declines in Asia pacific and Italy follow America’s grew. Business consulting services signing to were up 23% driven by 144% increase in the long-term business transformation outsourcing signings. Signings growth was driven by the America’s and Europe. Consulting insistence integration signings were up 4%. Driven by growth in our longer term US federal business. Strengths this quarter were in the strategy change and supply team management practices within CNSI, as well as overall strength in the financial services sector SMB and the America’s. We are taking actions to improve our growth in consulting insistence integration. I will mention just a few. We are increasing the level of dedicated sales resource to drive our business and web services and that’s a way solutions.
Further investing and resource to address as mid market opportunity increasing the level of brand resource in Asia Pacific, and leveraging our global and designs build and run capability. Our business transformation outsourcing business continued at strong year-to-year growth. ETO is an important offering to address the business performance transformation services opportunity. Other element include the strategy in change practice. Engineering and technology services and business performance software. For the year BPTS revenue was $4 billion up 28% year-to-year. Turning to margin global services growth margin improved 3.1 points year-to-year. Pre-tax margin was 11.9% and improvement of 2.4 points year-to-year. The year-to-year improvement in pre-tax margin was primarily driven by benefits from our restructuring action. CNSI utilization improvements and a better contract profile. Offset by IT investments and pension increases. The margin also benefited from a portion of the real estate gain, which contributed approximately the same amount from margin as the gain from a divestiture in the fourth quarter of last year.
So to wrap up the year, we improved our margin performance year-to-year for making our services business more cost competitive. Productivity initiatives such as professional market place began to take whole, this helps price to improve utilization and will be one of the drivers of margin expansion going forward. We increased our global delivery capabilities by adding over 15,000 resources to our global delivery resource centers. We grew long-term signings 19% for the year. These signings provide benefits over longer periods of time with little immediate impact revenue growth. Backlog will be stable with increased signing to less erosion than 2004. We did however fall short of our revenue expectations for the year primarily in our short-term businesses.
Looking forward our pipeline for the first quarter is up year-to-year with particular strength in our long term businesses. As always we need to execute to convert the pipeline designing. We expect improvements in our short-term businesses. Actions we are taking in integrated technology services, and consulting and systems integration should yield benefits over the course of the year. Our business transformation outsourcing business remained strong. Based on this we expect services revenue growth to accelerate throughout 2006 to achieve mid single digit revenue growth in the second half. And we will continue to focus on driving higher margins with more competitive cost structure.
Now I will move on to systems and technology group chart 12. Systems and technology group revenue at $6.8 billion grew 6% year-to-year and 10% at constant currency on the continued strength of the zSeries and pSeries servers, storage in our microelectronics business. zSeries revenue grew 5% year-to-year and 10% at constant currency. MIPS grew 28% year-to-year, this is our largest quarter of MIPS shipments on record and our highest revenue since fourth quarter 1998. Today over 50% of our revenue is driven by new workload such as Linux and Java, compared to only 15% at the end of 1998. This increased adoption of new workload by our customers highlights the broader applicability of the platform, enhanced customer benefits of our latest system z9. iSeries revenue declined 18% at the quarter as we wrapped around our high and POWER5 introduction in late 2004. We saw late quarter fall off as customers anticipated the first quarter announcement of new POWER5+-based products. For the full year iSeries grew 1% year-to-year. In 2005 iSeries added over 2500 new customers reflecting a continued commitment to the platforms from ISVs, resellers and customers.
pSeries unit servers grew 4% year-to-year and 7% at constant currency in what we believe is a flat market. We saw additional demand in quarter in the public sector which had an impact to our margin. The full year performance is extraordinary with 15% year-to-year growth, double-digit growth in all geography. We expect this will be the fourth consecutive year of pSeries share gain. The refresh of our POWER5 product line began in the fourth quarter and additional rollouts are coming in 2006.
xSeries service revenue was flat year-to-year and up 3% at constant currency. xSeries volumes were up 13%, however we saw strong competitive pressures drive lower pricing. We expect to maintain our leadership position in Blade center with fourth quarter revenue growth of 41% and full year growth of 65%. Total storage delivered year-to-year growth of 24% driven by strength in both Enterprise and mid range disk. Total disk grew 32%, with Enterprise disk at 46% and midrange disk growing 40%. Tape also turned in a strong performance growing 8%. We believe we have gained significant share in external disk and extended our share leadership in tape.
Our storage virtualization momentum, continued in the fourth quarter with growth of almost 40%. Total storage margin improved quarter-to-quarter always down year-to-year driven by intensified competition on price. And the mix impact of our midrange growth in both disc and tape. Microelectronics fourth quarter revenue grew 48% year-to-year. Revenue from our 300 millimeter products grew over 250%. Yields in our gain processor continue to exceed expectations this quarter, with our first full quarter of production shipments. In addition to the AMD Commitment announced in the fourth quarter last week we announced that Sony and Toshiba signed 5 year extension in our development partnership. We believe collaborative relationships like these also enable us to leverage IBM technology in the Jason market. Engineering in technology services grew 7% as reported and 14% at constant currency. Bringing full year growth to about 40%. EMPS enables customer to leverage our design skills know how and technical capabilities to meet their needs and its part of the high growth business performance transformation services opportunity. I will move on to software chart 13.
Software revenue was $4.6 billion in the quarter, flat year over year as reported but up 3% at constant currency. For the full year software grew 4% both as reported and at constant currency. Key branded middleware grew 3% as reported, and 7% at constant currency in the fourth quarter. This concluded a solid year with key branded middleware growing 9% year-to-year as reported and at constant currency. Driven by double digit growth in WebShphere, Tivoli and Lotus. Operating expenses were down 6% as reported. And down 3% at constant currency. For the full year operating expenses were down 2% as reported and down 3% at constant currency. The software market remains highly competitive. And our fourth quarter results for mix by geography: We saw double digit growth in the Americas where we believe we gained market share in both the fourth quarter and full year. This is partially offset by weaker results in Europe. The WebSphere family of software grew 4% as reported and 7% at constant currency. For the full year, WebSphere grew 10% both as reported and at constant currency. The WebSphere family of software provides the foundation technologies for customers implementing business processes and application and its services oriented architecture. As the customers interest in SOA has increased so has the demand for highly scalable robust infrastructure platforms, such as WebSphere.
In 2005 we saw particular strength in WebSphere application service and portal which grew 15% and 12% respectively. The WebSphere application service did particularly well in the fourth quarter growing 16%. In October we completed the acquisition of data power technology, which combines hardware and software technology in an appliance that helps simplify accelerate and increase the security of SOA deployments. Information management software grew 4% year-to-year as reported and 8% at constant currency. For the year information management grew 8%. In 2005 we saw growth in our information management distributed software, fuel by our content management and information integration product steps.
Ascential continues to exceed our expectation. Lotus revenue grew 2% year-to-year as reported and 7% at constant currency for the fourth quarter, completing a good year of 10% growth. Lotus continues to enjoy strong customer response for the Domino version 7.0 product line, as well as very high interest in workplace software. Workplace more than doubled both year-over-year and sequentially. Rational Software declined 2% as reported and grew 2% at constant currency in the fourth quarter. For the full year, Rational grew 4%. In the fourth quarter the Rational products that had good performance in both Asia and Europe, in the America a small number of customers delayed their buying decisions.
Tivoli grew 3% as reported and 7% at constant currency in the quarter. Full year growth was at 11%. Tivoli storage software products grew 17% of the quarter and 24% for the year as customer adoption of our virtualization technologies continue to gain traction. And the fourth quarter we announced our intention to acquire Micromuse. This software helps the customers manage the complex IT networks that support data, voice and video traffic. Micromuse is well positioned to participate in the growing demand for a variety of voice, audio and video services delivered over the Internet.
Overall our software businesses were solid in 2005. We believe we gain share in all 5 key middleware brands in the 2005 and held share in total middleware. The profitability of our software portfolio, improved as well, with pre-tax income margin growing by 3 points in 2005. Now I will wrap up chart 14.
We accomplished a lot in 2005, with solid growth and earnings in cash generation balanced across our portfolio. IBM delivered earnings per share growth of 12% as reported, 18% without non-recurring item and 21% without the non-recurring item and our divested PC business. This profit performance is driven by a combination of unit performance, portfolio actions and execution of our productivity initiatives. This year we have taken a number of very important action. To improve productivity and reallocate resources to the faster growing areas of the business. We completed the sale of our PC business to Anova.
The transition was smooth and to our relationship with Anova we are better positioned in China’s fast growing market. We continue to invest in acquisitions to strengthen our on demand capability. In 2005 we completed 16 acquisitions primarily in software and services at an aggregate cost of $2 billion. We further extended our commitment innovation and open standards. We successfully implemented a large restructuring action to improve that competitiveness of our cost structure. We changed our operating model in Europe, driving resources and decision making closer to the customer to improve speed and responsiveness. We redesigned our US pension plan and we are taking actions in other countries as well.
Over the longer term, these changes will result in less for utility and a more comparative cost structure. These actions contributed to our strong earnings in cash performance in 2005. And strengthen our capabilities as a globally integrated company. Now let’s move to chart 15.
Before wrapping up, I would like to spend a minute discussing the structure of our business. Often time to think about IBM only in terms of revenue mix. I would like to instead focus this discussion on profit mix, which is a source of our strong cash flow. We would do this in a very straight-forward way by discussing the profit generation of our software business, our hardware business and our services business. Based on 2005 segment pre-tax profit, excluding second quarter restructuring charges in PCs, approximately 37% of our 2005 total segments profit was generated from software. Another 28% from hardware and financing and 35% from services. Strategically, we have exceeded low margin commoditized businesses and created a more balanced portfolio. We integrated package across our segment to create solution offerings for global customer base driving profit in cash over the long term. We can look at this past quarter as an example, we’ve showed strong hardware growth of 9% at constant currency with particular strength in storage, microelectronics, zSeries and pSeries Servers.
Software revenue grew 3% at constant currency. Our key middleware brands now over 50% of our total software revenue grew 7%, while our operating systems and other middleware operating give a solid profit in cash generation, and in services revenue decline 1% despite the varying revenue dynamics some hardware, software and services each segment contributed solid profit growth.
Now let me digress for a moment on the contribution of long term signing to our near term profit, large long term deals are good for the business to be sure, but the yield to revenue from long term signing within a given year is typically only 8% to 10% of the total long term signing demand. This means that the contribution from $1 billion of long term signing within the year at average gross margins. Well at most provide IBM with $28 to $ 30 million as a profit in the year, a small amount as compared to 2006 pre-tax earnings base of roughly $12 billion. These signings provide more significant benefits to revenue and profit over the longer term. The strength of the IBM business model is not in any single component it is in our ability to generate consistently strong cash and earnings with balance contribution across our broad portfolio of the industry leading business segments.
So what this is all mean for 2006, we are position to continued to drive margin improvements with more competitive cost structure across the portfolio about 2/3rd of our profits will come from hardware and software with continuing growth from our strong product line. We expect to grow service signing in first quarter by improving execution on short term signings and driving closure on key long term deals, which will help provide a stable base business for years to come. And as always we have headwinds to work driven 2006 such as continued year-to-year increase in pension cost and the impact of our business from the strengthening as a dollar.
Turning to the average of the analyst earnings per share estimates for 2006, based on what we known now and the study economic environment it would be reasonable to roll through the fourth quarter operational over achievement excluding the real estate over achievement and as always we remain committed to deliver double digit earnings per share growth over the long term.
During the intergraded portfolio of hardware, software and services. Now Participants I would take your questions.
Patricia Murphy, VP of IR
Thanks Mark before we begin the Q&A let me comment on two items. First is always we have a few supplemental charge of the backend of the deck, but complement marks prepared remarks. Second as always please reframe from multi part question which will allow us to take questions from our callers. Okay operator lets open it up for questions.
Questions and Answer
Operator
Operator Instructions. Our first question is from Tony Sacconaghi, with Sanford Bernstein you may begin sir.
Q - Tony Sacconaghi
Yes thank you, sorry I can resist but I did have a clarification in the question. You had mentioned Mark to roll through the over achievement just to be specific on that you beat consensus estimates by $0.17 this quarter your over achievement from extra real estate was about $0.4.5 to $0.5 so you are suggesting that consensus analyst estimate should go up by 12% such as one as to clarify that. And then second for 2006 and then secondly I wanted to just give us a sense of your productivity initiatives when you talked about last year you are expecting a yield on your workforce reduction of 3 million to 500 million in second half of 2005 and the yield of 2 to 3 expect in 2006. Is that still in line with your expectations or did you actually get a bit more than you thought in the second half and how should you will be thinking about 2006 thank you.
A - Mark Loughridge
Yes Tony, for your first question you are quite current we would view the operational over achievement in the fourth quarter at that $0.12 range in excluding the $0.5 the real estate that we have achieved. And your second question we got about what we have thought in 2005 at 500 million, and that was spilled about 200 million in the third and 300 million in the fourth. So if you look for 2006 consistent with what we said earlier we think the cost expense saving for the restructure remains at 1.3 billion or 800 million year-to-year. Now I would keep in mind that these actions are designs to drive more competitive business especially in services, and over the longer term these action give us a more competitive cost structure more pricing flexibility and allows the better manage excluding labor cost.
Patricia Murphy, VP of IR
Thanks Tony lets go to the next question please.
Operator
Next question is from Bill Shope, with JP Morgan you may begin.
Q - Bill Shope
Okay great thanks looking at microelectronics business when you combine with strength and the 300 millimeter business with the declines in the legacy business, can you give us read on what the overall margin impacts from the business for data, quantitative or qualitative, given that 200 million to decline, could you just see a benefits on our rigorous margin.
A - Mark Loughridge
Yeah let me first startup let say we are pretty pleased with the growth that we saw in our 300 millimeter, and we are very pleased as we move into 2006 with that momentum. We did have a very good quarter microelectronics and we have made a lot of progress, the primary focus from investment side our mind is in technology in the 300 millimeter fab is to drive leadership in our systems business. So the game chips that’s drove volume buying this quarter benefit from the same technology in fact the quarter the IBM system but what I would like as also remember that the power base unique serves have been gaining shares since IBM, that were introduced the technology years ago and POWER5 has also had a strong impact on high in storage, we had 46% growth in the quarter and now we are starting introduce our POWER5+ into our service line. So I would say yes and its okay as you look at it to look at those trends in expect those continued that kind of momentum as we go into ’06.
Patricia Murphy, VP of IR
Okay thanks, so let’s go to the next question please.
Operator
Yes our next question is from Lora Canablerio (ph) with Goldman Fax, you may begin.
Q - Lora Canablerio
Yes on the services side. If you, others have suggested that outsourcing growth is going to be slower in ’06 which could be your obviously real problems in outsourcing to about 70% your bookings also its pretty well in the side you got more than the normal amount of business offering new in ‘06, so with that opens up the possibilities even more unpredictability and of course signings have been pretty erotic based on what you expected this quarter and what didn’t happen, so how can you be confident under the circumstances that you will be able to pull through the kind of services growth that you are anticipating, what for example can you tell us about on specific pipelines or having been down selected or anything that gives us more specifiticity so that it adds your confidence level?
A - Mark Loughridge
Well first of all I will let start very good question, lets start with from our demand prospective as we look at SOA the out sort of market in huge and there is a plenty of opportunity out there we frankly like the way we are positioned, we are the market share leader which will we believe we will maintain and on longer term signings for the year of which SOA is the major component I mean, the longer term contempt was up 19% for 2005, now those are just by nature the signing is going to be a lumpier in nature but as we look at both our pipeline and the deal less for our long term signing is going into the first quarter, we are quite optimistic. So I think we actually tough you are correct at the long term signings are lumpier in nature if you look at the full year performance in long term I actually think its pretty good and we are quite confident on a long term basis as we enter the first quarter.
Patricia Murphy, VP of IR
Thanks Lora lets go to the next question please
Operator
Next question from Steven Fortuna with Prudential Equity Group, you may began.
Q - Steven Fortuna
Yes there is one question Mark group xSeries basically flat year-over-year, how much of that is increased competition from herewith ,are they are much more formidable portion in the market place over the past say three months, six months versus the year ago.
A - Mark Loughridge
Well let’s say let’s look at this way as we first of all we posted at our higher volumes in xSeries history and our growing double digit of 13%, so we gain volumes share for the third consecutive quarter however our revenue per unit has declined year-over-year resulting 4% growth of constant currency. So if you look at the reason behind it I put it in three category, number one we've grown our volumes 31% in high in space driven by very solid full way rack performance and we gain share in the four way space so we seen our revenue per unit row driven by competitive price pressures. Number two, we have experience competitive price pressures in Asia, Pacific and Europe particularly in our main stream one and two way products which still represent large part of the market in these regions of the world and last I told that we have also faced some operation execution issue as we transition some models when the call demand on some of our products in the fourth quarter and we are not able to still supply to satisfy this damdnd but I go back to the top number one volume did improve, we did have price pressure and we are very confidence momentum in our place.
Patricia Murphy, VP of IR
Thanks Steve let’s go to the next question please
Operator
Next question is from Richard Gardner with Citigroup, you may begin sir
Q - Richard Gardner
Okay thank you, Mark a simple question. Q4 was the first quarter in five and what’s your experience significantly comparative backlog in services its look like it was about $1.5 billion. Could you just talk about what was the cost of that and may be expectations for backlog we gets on go forward basis here as we go into 2006? Thank you
A - Mark Loughridge
Yeah, that’s a good question. First of all as I look at the erosion in the fourth quarter was higher than previous quarter but for the full year erosion was down really quiet significantly and if you looking at the level of erosion in 2005 was frankly down 40% from 2004 and even if you exclude JPMC from 2004 erosion in 2005 was still down nearly 20% and in fact the erosion at 2005 was the lowest level we’ve had in four years. So I don’t think for data really suggest as a problem in erosion although erosion in a way like long term signings can be lumpier as distributed to your quarterly performance, so I would look at longer term trends.
Patricia Murphy, VP of IR
Thanks let’s go to the next question please
Operator
Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with UBS. You may begin.
Q - Ben Reitzes
Yeah Good afternoon, could you talk about the Mainframe and perhaps pSeries, you talked about the zSeries, I believe 5% growth, can you just talk about this new cycle what’s different should we expect an acceleration throughout the year and then also with pSeries with a slower growth in other quarters may be you for shadowing your some new product cycle. Can you talk about those two big areas in hardware and how will you look at those in ’06 thanks
A - Mark Loughridge
You Ben, we do as you look the zSeries cycle its you can’t really project with any level of position but I will say that we expect to see continued growth to the first half of 2006 continue in the momentum that we’ve seen in the fourth quarter, we do expect to see moderate in the growth in the second half of ’06 as we begin to wrap around our initial z9 shipments towards the end of year. If you look at your second question pSeries, pSeries grew 15% for the full year which I think demonstrates our technology leadership in the UNIX market. We’ve grown market share consistently for four years in this brand, the higher growth rates early in the year was still by a fully refreshed POWER5 product versus the POWER4 in prior year and I think fourth quarter conference tends to growth of 8% is roughly in line with our future expectation which is to grow above the units market share in the continued gain share. To resourcing our growth both on competitive displacements and from expanding work load with our existing customers.
Patricia Murphy, VP of IR
Thanks Ben, lets go to the next question please.

The next question is from Shilly Shaw with Morn Cadet (ph)
Q - Shilly Shaw
Thanks I wanted to ask you about offshore, what I am hearing from the industry contacts with IBM is now fully price competent and capable against the offshore prepaid in my question is, are we going to see IBM turn around to take to offensive offshore now and how my fully price competitive capability affect in a contract renewals that might be coming up?
A - Mark Loughridge
We were continually adjusting our resources investment in response to the market place and I would step back and say we think we have a very competitive position with the global solution capabilities we developed and continued to increase the volume work with our clients so we have grown resources in our global delivery centers is over 15,000 this year alone but I want to re-emphasize that this is not a labor arbitraries elements of the strategy its really developing extensive capability in both application services SO, BTO services delivery and technical support so it’s a broad skill based a good distribution on a global basis and I think it puts us in good shape as we enter 2006.
Patricia Murphy, VP of IR
Thanks Cindy let go to the next question please.
Operator
The next question is from Chris Wetmorn with Douche Bank, you may began
Q - Chris Wetmorn
Thanks just following up on that last question how does IBM and how is IBM currently viewing the trade of between pricing and taking prices lower in services and profitability in that segment as some of these re-structuring benefits come through and intend to that what percentage of the incremental cost savings does the IBM expect as fall of the bottom line in ’06
A - Mark Loughridge
Well you known its very difficult to tell the percentage of those cost savings that fall the bottom line and if you look at it as I said earlier on the Tony's question we did achieve our cost savings objective this year on both the third and fourth quarter and aggregate that was 500 million and we look for another 800 million year-to-year but I said from a price stand point and services, price pressures were really increase stable on the quarter but it is of course a very competitive segment in both SO and ITS prices pressures remain fairly constant that the world wide level. Well in CNSI pricing trend to pretty stable or if anything improving a bit.
Patricia Murphy, VP of IR
Thanks Chris lets go to the next question please
Operator
Thank you our next question is from Rebecca Ronko you may begin
Q - Rebecca
Hi great just a follow on to that market as well as relates to hardware you commented a couple of times in your prepared marks about increasing pressures on servers and storage competitive place begin Does what we haven’t see it take some of the re-structuring down into the pricing side of the pressures when you got to drop to the bottom line but why, when do we see you get more aggressive and hardware given the competitive dynamics if on the first quarter
A - Mark Loughridge
Well let me describe the hardware dynamics first of all were as you would expect quite pleased with our hardware revenue growth in the quarter I would argue that were obviously priced pretty effectively has it is but I’ll give you some flavor underneath that into these serious we see a continuation of the trend of moderate price declines as we move more new work load under the platform and units we didn’t experienced some more aggressive price competition at the low end of the product line but really more stable at the high end In xSeries I would say that were fine in both AP and mere to be particularly competitive environments right now so very focused on achieving cost reduction to maintain margins here and in storage price pressures pretty high most notably in the mid range basis and also in Europe and Japan
Patricia Murphy, VP of IR
Okay, lets go to the next question please
Operator
Next question is from David Grossman with Clements Partners you may begin
Q - David Grossman
Thank you, Mark could you put up somewhat in little more details on the actions that you intend to take care to accelerate the gross in your short-term services business and also if you could just clarify your comment of your growth was that in a single digits for the year or was that in a single digit for the second half of the year in ’06
A - Mark Loughridge
My comments are really for the second half, at an ’06, accelerating up to the our first half of that objective, but as far as the actions were taking if you look at it first of all, on an ITS basis we’ve think that there is more work under way to drive more focused place I would say on higher growth areas, the initial portfolio balancing work is complete for focus on a high growth area such as security, infrastructure management, ITS optimization, and adding business development skills and sales coverage that aligned to advice portfolio. These changes we believe we will be operational and in the first quarter so we expect the traction as we enter ’06, if you look at the BCS some of the actions were taking including, first of all increasing the level of dedicated sales resource to drive solutions such as business at web services and SOA on investing in resources to address mid market opportunities, increasing the level of the brand resources and Asia Pacific, and leveraging our global and divine build and run capability, so very strong action across both the BCS and ITS portfolio, that we believe we will pay off and improve performance in that signing base as we enter ’06.

Our next question is from, Richard Farmer (ph) with Merry Lynch, you may begin
Q - Richard Farmer
Thank you, Mark now that the PC investor is well behind the company, I wonder if you capturing the expected none of the services business on the PC’s that when all goes selling, and I guess more generally, are the dynamic side you are seeing in the customer accounts but previously, had a PC component for them, how are those turning out of those more or less favorable without that element of your portfolio?
A - Mark Loughridge
I think first of all the transaction as we’ve completed it with a Anova has gone very, very well, I mean the level of partnership between the two organization is quite impressive. And we had very little problems as we ran to that transition so really the business plans following that both our elements that we would provide, fully Anova and the level of teamwork and integration, I think its going quite well.
